pampered, unexercised life gave him a juvenile chubbiness rather than the paunchiness of
premature middle age. He was of good height, and his handsome face would have made him
a notable gallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness.
Derby‘s parents took him abroad every summer, and he was quick to seize on the surface
aspects of European thought and expression. His Poe-like talents turned more and more
toward the decadent, and other artistic sensitivenesses and yearnings were half-aroused in
him. We had great discussions in those days. I had been through Harvard, had studied in a
Boston architect‘s office, had married, and had finally returned to Arkham to practice my
profession—settling in the family homestead in Saltonstall St. since my father had moved to
Florida for his health. Edward used to call almost every evening, till I came to regard him as
one of the household. He had a characteristic way of ringing the doorbell or sounding the
knocker that grew to be a veritable code signal, so that after dinner I always listened for the
familiar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause. Less frequently I would visit at
his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his constantly growing library.
Derby went through Miskatonic University in Arkham, since his parents would not let him
board away from them. He entered at sixteen and completed his course in three years,
majoring in English and French literature and receiving high marks in everything but
mathematics and the sciences. He mingled very little with the other students, though looking
enviously at the ―daring‖ or ―Bohemian‖ set—whose superficially ―smart‖ language and
meaninglessly ironic pose he aped, and whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt.
What he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of subterranean magical lore, for
which Miskatonic‘s library was and is famous. Always a dweller on the surface of phantasy
and strangeness, he now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous past
for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity. He read things like the frightful Book of Eibon, the
Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab
Abdul Alhazred, though he did not tell his parents he had seen them. Edward was twenty
when my son and only child was born, and seemed pleased when I named the newcomer
Edward Derby Upton, after him.
By the time he was twenty-five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned man and a fairly
well-known poet and fantaisiste, though his lack of contacts and responsibilities had slowed
down his literary growth by making his products derivative and overbookish. I was perhaps his
closest friend—finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical topics, while he relied on
me for advice in whatever matters he did not wish to refer to his parents. He remained
single—more through shyness, inertia, and parental protectiveness than through inclination—
and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent. When the war came
both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home. I went to Plattsburg for a commission, but
never got overseas.
So the years wore on. Edward‘s mother died when he was thirty-four, and for months he was
incapacitated by some odd psychological malady. His father took him to Europe, however,
and he managed to pull out of his trouble without visible effects. Afterward he seemed to feel
a sort of grotesque exhilaration, as if of partial escape from some unseen bondage. He began
to mingle in the more ―advanced‖ college set despite his middle age, and was present at
some extremely wild doings—on one occasion paying heavy blackmail (which he borrowed of
me) to keep his presence at a certain affair from his father‘s notice. Some of the whispered
rumours about the wild Miskatonic set were extremely singular. There was even talk of black
magic and of happenings utterly beyond credibility.
II.
Edward was thirty-eight when he met Asenath Waite. She was, I judge, about twenty-three at
the time; and was taking a special course in mediaeval metaphysics at Miskatonic. The
daughter of a friend of mine had met her before—in the Hall School at Kingsport—and had
been inclined to shun her because of her odd reputation. She was dark, smallish, and very
good-looking except for overprotuberant eyes; but something in her expression alienated
extremely sensitive people. It was, however, largely her origin and conversation which caused
average folk to avoid her. She was one of the Innsmouth Waites, and dark legends have
clustered for generations about crumbling, half-deserted Innsmouth and its people. There are
tales of horrible bargains about the year 1850, and of a strange element ―not quite human‖ in
the ancient families of the run-down fishing port—tales such as only old-time Yankees can
devise and repeat with proper awesomeness.
Asenath‘s case was aggravated by the fact that she was Ephraim Waite‘s daughter—the child
of his old age by an unknown wife who always went veiled. Ephraim lived in a half-decayed
mansion in Washington Street, Innsmouth, and those who had seen the place (Arkham folk
avoid going to Innsmouth whenever they can) declared that the attic windows were always
boarded, and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within as evening drew on. The old
man was known to have been a prodigious magical student in his day, and legend averred
that he could raise or quell storms at sea according to his whim. I had seen him once or twice
in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the college library, and had
hated his wolfish, saturnine face with its tangle of iron-grey beard. He had died insane—under
rather queer circumstances—just before his daughter (by his will made a nominal ward of the
principal) entered the Hall School, but she had been his morbidly avid pupil and looked
fiendishly like him at times.
The friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite repeated many curious
things when the news of Edward‘s acquaintance with her began to spread about. Asenath, it
seemed, had posed as a kind of magician at school; and had really seemed able to
accomplish some highly baffling marvels. She professed to be able to raise thunderstorms,
though her seeming success was generally laid to some uncanny knack at prediction. All
animals markedly disliked her, and she could make any dog howl by certain motions of her
right hand. There were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very
singular—and very shocking—for a young girl; when she would frighten her schoolmates with
leers and winks of an inexplicable kind, and would seem to extract an obscene and zestful
irony from her present situation.
Most unusual, though, were the well-attested cases of her influence over other persons. She
was, beyond question, a genuine hypnotist. By gazing peculiarly at a fellow-student she would
often give the latter a distinct feeling of exchanged personality—as if the subject were placed
momentarily in the magician‘s body and able to stare half across the room at her real body,
whose eyes blazed and protruded with an alien expression. Asenath often made wild claims
about the nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame—or at
least from the life-processes of the physical frame. Her crowning rage, however, was that she
was not a man; since she believed a male brain had certain unique and far-reaching cosmic
powers. Given a man‘s brain, she declared, she could not only equal but surpass her father in
mastery of unknown forces.
Edward met Asenath at a gathering of ―intelligentsia‖ held in one of the students‘ rooms, and
could talk of nothing else when he came to see me the next day. He had found her full of the
interests and erudition which engrossed him most, and was in addition wildly taken with her
appearance. I had never seen the young woman, and recalled casual references only faintly,
but I knew who she was. It seemed rather regrettable that Derby should become so upheaved
about her; but I said nothing to discourage him, since infatuation thrives on opposition. He
was not, he said, mentioning her to his father.
In the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young Derby. Others now
remarked Edward‘s autumnal gallantry, though they agreed that he did not look even nearly
his actual age, or seem at all inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity. He was only a
trifle paunchy despite his indolence and self-indulgence, and his face was absolutely without
lines. Asenath, on the other hand, had the premature crow‘s feet which come from the
exercise of an intense will.
About this time Edward brought the girl to call on me, and I at once saw that his interest was
by no means one-sided. She eyed him continually with an almost predatory air, and I
perceived that their intimacy was beyond untangling. Soon afterward I had a visit from old Mr.
Derby, whom I had always admired and respected. He had heard the tales of his son‘s new
friendship, and had wormed the whole truth out of ―the boy‖. Edward meant to marry Asenath,
and had even been looking at houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with
his son, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised affair off; but I regretfully
expressed my doubts. This time it was not a question of Edward‘s weak will but of the
woman‘s strong will. The perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental
image to a new and stronger image, and nothing could be done about it.
The wedding was performed a month later—by a justice of the peace, according to the bride‘s
request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered no opposition; and he, my wife, my son, and I
attended the brief ceremony—the other guests being wild young people from the college.
Asenath had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the end of High Street, and
they proposed to settle there after a short trip to Innsmouth, whence three servants and some
books and household goods were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration
for Edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its library, and its crowd
of ―sophisticates‖, that made Asenath settle in Arkham instead of returning permanently home.
When Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked slightly changed.
Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache, but there was more than that.
He looked soberer and more thoughtful, his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being
exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness. I was puzzled to decide whether I liked or
disliked the change. Certainly, he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever
before. Perhaps the marriage was a good thing—might not the change of dependence form a
start toward actual neutralisation, leading ultimately to responsible independence? He came
alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought a vast store of books and apparatus from
Innsmouth (Derby shuddered as he spoke the name), and was finishing the restoration of the
Crowninshield house and grounds.
Her home in—that town—was a rather disquieting place, but certain objects in it had taught
him some surprising things. He was progressing fast in esoteric lore now that he had
Asenath‘s guidance. Some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radical—
he did not feel at liberty to describe them—but he had confidence in her powers and
intentions. The three servants were very queer—an incredibly aged couple who had been with
old Ephraim and referred occasionally to him and to Asenath‘s dead mother in a cryptic way,
and a swarthy young wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a
perpetual odour of fish.
III.
For the next two years I saw less and less of Derby. A fortnight would sometimes slip by
without the familiar three-and-two strokes at the front door; and when he did call—or when, as
happened with increasing infrequency, I called on him—he was very little disposed to
converse on vital topics. He had become secretive about those occult studies which he used
to describe and discuss so minutely, and preferred not to talk of his wife. She had aged
tremendously since her marriage, till now—oddly enough—she seemed the elder of the two.
Her face held the most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen, and her whole
aspect seemed to gain a vague, unplaceable repulsiveness. My wife and son noticed it as
much as I, and we all ceased gradually to call on her—for which, Edward admitted in one of
his boyishly tactless moments, she was unmitigatedly grateful. Occasionally the Derbys would
go on long trips—ostensibly to Europe, though Edward sometimes hinted at obscurer
destinations.
It was after the first year that people began talking about the change in Edward Derby. It was
very casual talk, for the change was purely psychological; but it brought up some interesting
points. Now and then, it seemed, Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do
things wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature. For example—although in the old
days he could not drive a car, he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old
Crowninshield driveway with Asenath‘s powerful Packard, handling it like a master, and
meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his accustomed
nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back from some trip or just starting on
one—what sort of trip, no one could guess, although he mostly favoured the Innsmouth road.
Oddly, the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing. People said he looked too much
like his wife, or like old Ephraim Waite himself, in these moments—or perhaps these moments
seemed unnatural because they were so rare. Sometimes, hours after starting out in this way,
he would return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an obviously hired
chauffeur or mechanic drove. Also, his preponderant aspect on the streets during his
decreasing round of social contacts (including, I may say, his calls on me) was the old-time
indecisive one—its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past. While
Asenath‘s face aged, Edward‘s—aside from those exceptional occasions—actually relaxed
into a kind of exaggerated immaturity, save when a trace of the new sadness or
understanding would flash across it. It was really very puzzling. Meanwhile the Derbys almost
dropped out of the gay college circle—not through their own disgust, we heard, but because
something about their present studies shocked even the most callous of the other decadents.
It was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint openly to me of a certain
fear and dissatisfaction. He would let fall remarks about things ‗going too far‘, and would talk
darkly about the need of ‗saving his identity‘. At first I ignored such references, but in time I
began to question him guardedly, remembering what my friend‘s daughter had said about
Asenath‘s hypnotic influence over the other girls at school—the cases where students had
thought they were in her body looking across the room at themselves. This questioning
seemed to make him at once alarmed and grateful, and once he mumbled something about
having a serious talk with me later.
About this time old Mr. Derby died, for which I was afterward very thankful. Edward was badly
upset, though by no means disorganised. He had seen astonishingly little of his parent since
his marriage, for Asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family linkage.
Some called him callous in his loss—especially since those jaunty and confident moods in the
car began to increase. He now wished to move back into the old Derby mansion, but Asenath
insisted on staying in the Crowninshield house, to which she had become well adjusted.
Not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend—one of the few who had not
dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the end of High St. to call on the couple, and had
seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with Edward‘s oddly confident and almost sneering
face above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by the repulsive wench that
Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look up at the house in leaving. There, at one of
Edward‘s library windows, she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face—a face whose
expression of pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description. It
was—incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast—Asenath‘s; yet the caller had
vowed that in that instant the sad, muddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it.
Edward‘s calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints occasionally became concrete.
What he said was not to be believed, even in centuried and legend-haunted Arkham; but he
threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity.
He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places, of Cyclopean ruins in the heart of the
Maine woods beneath which vast staircases lead down to abysses of nighted secrets, of
complex angles that lead through invisible walls to other regions of space and time, and of
hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and forbidden places,
on other worlds, and in different space-time continua.
He would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which utterly
nonplussed me—elusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like nothing ever heard of
on earth, whose insane curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed
no conceivable geometry. These things, he said, came ‗from outside‘; and his wife knew how
to get them. Sometimes—but always in frightened and ambiguous whispers—he would
suggest things about old Ephraim Waite, whom he had seen occasionally at the college
library in the old days. These adumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve
around some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really dead—in a
spiritual as well as corporeal sense.
At times Derby would halt abruptly in his revelations, and I wondered whether Asenath could
possibly have divined his speech at a distance and cut him off through some unknown sort of
telepathic mesmerism—some power of the kind she had displayed at school. Certainly, she
suspected that he told me things, for as the weeks passed she tried to stop his visits with
words and glances of a most inexplicable potency. Only with difficulty could he get to see me,
for although he would pretend to be going somewhere else, some invisible force would
generally clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the time being. His visits
usually came when Asenath was away—‗away in her own body‘, as he once oddly put it. She
always found out later—the servants watched his goings and comings—but evidently she
thought it inexpedient to do anything drastic.
IV.
Derby had been married more than three years on that August day when I got the telegram
from Maine. I had not seen him for two months, but had heard he was away ―on business‖.
Asenath was supposed to be with him, though watchful gossips declared there was someone
upstairs in the house behind the doubly curtained windows. They had watched the purchases
made by the servants. And now the town marshal of Chesuncook had wired of the draggled
madman who stumbled out of the woods with delirious ravings and screamed to me for
protection. It was Edward—and he had been just able to recall his own name and my name
and address.
Chesuncook is close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest belt in Maine, and it
took a whole day of feverish jolting through fantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a
car. I found Derby in a cell at the town farm, vacillating between frenzy and apathy. He knew
me at once, and began pouring out a meaningless, half-incoherent torrent of words in my
direction.
―Dan—for God‘s sake! The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand steps . . . the
abomination of abominations . . . I never would let her take me, and then I found myself there.
. . . Iä! Shub-Niggurath! . . . The shape rose up from the altar, and there were 500 that howled.
. . . The Hooded Thing bleated ‗Kamog! Kamog!‘—that was old Ephraim‘s secret name in the
coven. . . . I was there, where she promised she wouldn‘t take me. . . . A minute before I was
locked in the library, and then I was there where she had gone with my body—in the place of
utter blasphemy, the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the
gate. . . . I saw a shoggoth—it changed shape. . . . I can‘t stand it. . . . I won‘t stand it. . . . I‘ll
kill her if she ever sends me there again. . . . I‘ll kill that entity . . . her, him, it . . . I‘ll kill it! I‘ll kill
it with my own hands!‖
It took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next day I got him decent clothes
in the village, and set out with him for Arkham. His fury of hysteria was spent, and he was
inclined to be silent; though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed
through Augusta—as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant memories. It was clear that he
did not wish to go home; and considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his
wife—delusions undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had
been subjected—I thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I resolved, put him up
myself for a time; no matter what unpleasantness it would make with Asenath. Later I would
help him get a divorce, for most assuredly there were mental factors which made this
marriage suicidal for him. When we struck open country again Derby‘s muttering faded away,
and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I drove.
During our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again, more distinctly
than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about Asenath. The
extent to which she had preyed on Edward‘s nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set
of hallucinations around her. His present predicament, he mumbled furtively, was only one of
a long series. She was getting hold of him, and he knew that some day she would never let
go. Even now she probably let him go only when she had to, because she couldn‘t hold on
long at a time. She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for nameless rites,
leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs—but sometimes she couldn‘t hold on, and
he would find himself suddenly in his own body again in some far-off, horrible, and perhaps
unknown place. Sometimes she‘d get hold of him again and sometimes she couldn‘t. Often he
was left stranded somewhere as I had found him . . . time and again he had to find his way
home from frightful distances, getting somebody to drive the car after he found it.
The worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at a time. She wanted
to be a man—to be fully human—that was why she got hold of him. She had sensed the
mixture of fine-wrought brain and weak will in him. Some day she would crowd him out and
disappear with his body—disappear to become a great magician like her father and leave him
marooned in that female shell that wasn‘t even quite human. Yes, he knew about the
Innsmouth blood now. There had been traffick with things from the sea—it was horrible. . . .
And old Ephraim—he had known the secret, and when he grew old did a hideous thing to
keep alive . . . he wanted to live forever . . . Asenath would succeed—one successful
demonstration had taken place already.
As Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely, verifying the impression of change which
an earlier scrutiny had given me. Paradoxically, he seemed in better shape than usual—
harder, more normally developed, and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused by his
indolent habits. It was as if he had been really active and properly exercised for the first time
in his coddled life, and I judged that Asenath‘s force must have pushed him into unwonted
channels of motion and alertness. But just now his mind was in a pitiable state; for he was
mumbling wild extravagances about his wife, about black magic, about old Ephraim, and
about some revelation which would convince even me. He repeated names which I
recognised from bygone browsings in forbidden volumes, and at times made me shudder with
a certain thread of mythological consistency—of convincing coherence—which ran through
his maundering. Again and again he would pause, as if to gather courage for some final and
terrible disclosure.
―Dan, Dan, don‘t you remember him—the wild eyes and the unkempt beard that never turned
white? He glared at me once, and I never forgot it. Now she glares that way. And I know why!
He found it in the Necronomicon—the formula. I don‘t dare tell you the page yet, but when I
do you can read and understand. Then you will know what has engulfed me. On, on, on, on—
body to body to body—he means never to die. The life-glow—he knows how to break the link
. . . it can flicker on a while even when the body is dead. I‘ll give you hints, and maybe you‘ll
guess. Listen, Dan—do you know why my wife always takes such pains with that silly
backhand writing? Have you ever seen a manuscript of old Ephraim‘s? Do you want to know
why I shivered when I saw some hasty notes Asenath had jotted down?
―Asenath . . . is there such a person? Why did they half think there was poison in old
Ephraim‘s stomach? Why do the Gilmans whisper about the way he shrieked—like a
frightened child—when he went mad and Asenath locked him up in the padded attic room
where—the other—had been? Was it old Ephraim’s soul that was locked in? Who locked in
whom? Why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a weak will?
Why did he curse that his daughter wasn‘t a son? Tell me, Daniel Upton—what devilish
exchange was perpetrated in the house of horror where that blasphemous monster had his
trusting, weak-willed, half-human child at his mercy? Didn‘t he make it permanent—as she‘ll
do in the end with me? Tell me why that thing that calls itself Asenath writes differently when
off guard, so that you can’t tell its script from . . .”
Then the thing happened. Derby‘s voice was rising to a thin treble scream as he raved, when
suddenly it was shut off with an almost mechanical click. I thought of those other occasions at
my home when his confidences had abruptly ceased—when I had half fancied that some
obscure telepathic wave of Asenath‘s mental force was intervening to keep him silent. This,
though, was something altogether different—and, I felt, infinitely more horrible. The face
beside me was twisted almost unrecognisably for a moment, while through the whole body
there passed a shivering motion—as if all the bones, organs, muscles, nerves, and glands
were readjusting themselves to a radically different posture, set of stresses, and general
personality.
Just where the supreme horror lay, I could not for my life tell; yet there swept over me such a
swamping wave of sickness and repulsion—such a freezing, petrifying sense of utter alienage
and abnormality—that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain. The figure beside me
seemed less like a lifelong friend than like some monstrous intrusion from outer space—some
damnable, utterly accursed focus of unknown and malign cosmic forces.
I had faltered only a moment, but before another moment was over my companion had seized
the wheel and forced me to change places with him. The dusk was now very thick, and the
lights of Portland far behind, so I could not see much of his face. The blaze of his eyes,
though, was phenomenal; and I knew that he must now be in that queerly energised state—
so unlike his usual self—which so many people had noticed. It seemed odd and incredible
that listless Edward Derby—he who could never assert himself, and who had never learned to
drive—should be ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car, yet that was
precisely what had happened. He did not speak for some time, and in my inexplicable horror I
was glad he did not.
In the lights of Biddeford and Saco I saw his firmly set mouth, and shivered at the blaze of his
eyes. The people were right—he did look damnably like his wife and like old Ephraim when in
these moods. I did not wonder that the moods were disliked—there was certainly something
unnatural and diabolic in them, and I felt the sinister element all the more because of the wild
ravings I had been hearing. This man, for all my lifelong knowledge of Edward Pickman
Derby, was a stranger—an intrusion of some sort from the black abyss.
He did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road, and when he did his voice seemed
utterly unfamiliar. It was deeper, firmer, and more decisive than I had ever known it to be;
while its accent and pronunciation were altogether changed—though vaguely, remotely, and
rather disturbingly recalling something I could not quite place. There was, I thought, a trace of
very profound and very genuine irony in the timbre—not the flashy, meaninglessly jaunty
pseudo-irony of the callow ―sophisticate‖, which Derby had habitually affected, but something
grim, basic, pervasive, and potentially evil. I marvelled at the self-possession so soon
following the spell of panic-struck muttering.
―I hope you‘ll forget my attack back there, Upton,‖ he was saying. ―You know what my nerves
are, and I guess you can excuse such things. I‘m enormously grateful, of course, for this lift
home.
―And you must forget, too, any crazy things I may have been saying about my wife—and
about things in general. That‘s what comes from overstudy in a field like mine. My philosophy
is full of bizarre concepts, and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of imaginary
concrete applications. I shall take a rest from now on—you probably won‘t see me for some
time, and you needn‘t blame Asenath for it.
―This trip was a bit queer, but it‘s really very simple. There are certain Indian relics in the north
woods—standing stones, and all that—which mean a good deal in folklore, and Asenath and I
are following that stuff up. It was a hard search, so I seem to have gone off my head. I must
send somebody for the car when I get home. A month‘s relaxation will put me back on my
feet.‖
I do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was, for the baffling alienage of my
seatmate filled all my consciousness. With every moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror
increased, till at length I was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive. Derby did
not offer to relinquish the wheel, and I was glad of the speed with which Portsmouth and
Newburyport flashed by.
At the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids Innsmouth I was half afraid my
driver would take the bleak shore road that goes through that damnable place. He did not,
however, but darted rapidly past Rowley and Ipswich toward our destination. We reached
Arkham before midnight, and found the lights still on at the old Crowninshield house. Derby
left the car with a hasty repetition of his thanks, and I drove home alone with a curious feeling
of relief. It had been a terrible drive—all the more terrible because I could not quite tell why—
and I did not regret Derby‘s forecast of a long absence from my company.
V.
The next two months were full of rumours. People spoke of seeing Derby more and more in
his new energised state, and Asenath was scarcely ever in to her few callers. I had only one
visit from Edward, when he called briefly in Asenath‘s car—duly reclaimed from wherever he
had left it in Maine—to get some books he had lent me. He was in his new state, and paused
only long enough for some evasively polite remarks. It was plain that he had nothing to
discuss with me when in this condition—and I noticed that he did not even trouble to give the
old three-and-two signal when ringing the doorbell. As on that evening in the car, I felt a faint,
infinitely deep horror which I could not explain; so that his swift departure was a prodigious
relief.
In mid-September Derby was away for a week, and some of the decadent college set talked
knowingly of the matter—hinting at a meeting with a notorious cult-leader, lately expelled from
England, who had established headquarters in New York. For my part I could not get that
strange ride from Maine out of my head. The transformation I had witnessed had affected me
profoundly, and I caught myself again and again trying to account for the thing—and for the
extreme horror it had inspired in me.
But the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old Crowninshield house. The
voice seemed to be a woman‘s, and some of the younger people thought it sounded like
Asenath‘s. It was heard only at rare intervals, and would sometimes be choked off as if by
force. There was talk of an investigation, but this was dispelled one day when Asenath
appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a large number of
acquaintances—apologising for her recent absences and speaking incidentally about the
nervous breakdown and hysteria of a guest from Boston. The guest was never seen, but
Asenath‘s appearance left nothing to be said. And then someone complicated matters by
whispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a man‘s voice.
One evening in mid-October I heard the familiar three-and-two ring at the front door.
Answering it myself, I found Edward on the steps, and saw in a moment that his personality
was the old one which I had not encountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride
from Chesuncook. His face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions in which fear and
triumph seemed to share dominion, and he looked furtively over his shoulder as I closed the
door behind him.
Following me clumsily to the study, he asked for some whiskey to steady his nerves. I forbore
to question him, but waited till he felt like beginning whatever he wanted to say. At length he
ventured some information in a choking voice.
―Asenath has gone, Dan. We had a long talk last night while the servants were out, and I
made her promise to stop preying on me. Of course I had certain—certain occult defences I
never told you about. She had to give in, but got frightfully angry. Just packed up and started
for New York—walked right out to catch the 8:20 in to Boston. I suppose people will talk, but I
can‘t help that. You needn‘t mention that there was any trouble—just say she‘s gone on a long
research trip.
―She‘s probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of devotees. I hope she‘ll go
west and get a divorce—anyhow, I‘ve made her promise to keep away and let me alone. It
was horrible, Dan—she was stealing my body—crowding me out—making a prisoner of me. I
laid low and pretended to let her do it, but I had to be on the watch. I could plan if I was
careful, for she can‘t read my mind literally, or in detail. All she could read of my planning was
a sort of general mood of rebellion—and she always thought I was helpless. Never thought I
could get the best of her . . . but I had a spell or two that worked.‖
Derby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskey.
―I paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back. They were ugly about it,
and asked questions, but they went. They‘re her kind—Innsmouth people—and were hand
and glove with her. I hope they‘ll let me alone—I didn‘t like the way they laughed when they
walked away. I must get as many of Dad‘s old servants again as I can. I‘ll move back home
now.
―I suppose you think I‘m crazy, Dan—but Arkham history ought to hint at things that back up
what I‘ve told you—and what I‘m going to tell you. You‘ve seen one of the changes, too—in
your car after I told you about Asenath that day coming home from Maine. That was when she
got me—drove me out of my body. The last thing of the ride I remember was when I was all
worked up trying to tell you what that she-devil is. Then she got me, and in a flash I was back
at the house—in the library where those damned servants had me locked up—and in that
cursed fiend‘s body . . . that isn‘t even human. . . . You know, it was she you must have ridden
home with . . . that preying wolf in my body. . . . You ought to have known the difference!‖
I shuddered as Derby paused. Surely, I had known the difference—yet could I accept an
explanation as insane as this? But my distracted caller was growing even wilder.
―I had to save myself—I had to, Dan! She‘d have got me for good at Hallowmass—they hold a
Sabbat up there beyond Chesuncook, and the sacrifice would have clinched things. She‘d
have got me for good . . . she‘d have been I, and I‘d have been she . . . forever . . . too late. . .
. My body‘d have been hers for good. . . . She‘d have been a man, and fully human, just as
she wanted to be. . . . I suppose she‘d have put me out of the way—killed her own ex-body
with me in it, damn her, just as she did before—just as she, he, or it did before. . . .‖
Edward‘s face was now atrociously distorted, and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine as
his voice fell to a whisper.
―You must know what I hinted in the car—that she isn’t Asenath at all, but really old Ephraim
himself. I suspected it a year and a half ago, but I know it now. Her handwriting shews it when
she‘s off guard—sometimes she jots down a note in writing that‘s just like her father‘s
manuscripts, stroke for stroke—and sometimes she says things that nobody but an old man
like Ephraim could say. He changed forms with her when he felt death coming—she was the
only one he could find with the right kind of brain and a weak enough will—he got her body
permanently, just as she almost got mine, and then poisoned the old body he‘d put her into.
Haven‘t you seen old Ephraim‘s soul glaring out of that she-devil‘s eyes dozens of times . . .
and out of mine when she had control of my body?‖
The whisperer was panting, and paused for breath. I said nothing, and when he resumed his
voice was nearer normal. This, I reflected, was a case for the asylum, but I would not be the
one to send him there. Perhaps time and freedom from Asenath would do its work. I could see
that he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again.
―I‘ll tell you more later—I must have a long rest now. I‘ll tell you something of the forbidden
horrors she led me into—something of the age-old horrors that even now are festering in out-
of-the-way corners with a few monstrous priests to keep them alive. Some people know
things about the universe that nobody ought to know, and can do things that nobody ought to
be able to do. I‘ve been in it up to my neck, but that‘s the end. Today I‘d burn that damned
Necronomicon and all the rest if I were librarian at Miskatonic.
―But she can‘t get me now. I must get out of that accursed house as soon as I can, and settle
down at home. You‘ll help me, I know, if I need help. Those devilish servants, you know . . .
and if people should get too inquisitive about Asenath. You see, I can‘t give them her address.
. . . Then there are certain groups of searchers—certain cults, you know—that might
misunderstand our breaking up . . . some of them have damnably curious ideas and methods.
I know you‘ll stand by me if anything happens—even if I have to tell you a lot that will shock
you. . . .‖
I had Edward stay and sleep in one of the guest-chambers that night, and in the morning he
seemed calmer. We discussed certain possible arrangements for his moving back into the
Derby mansion, and I hoped he would lose no time in making the change. He did not call the
next evening, but I saw him frequently during the ensuing weeks. We talked as little as
possible about strange and unpleasant things, but discussed the renovation of the old Derby
house, and the travels which Edward promised to take with my son and me the following
summer.
Of Asenath we said almost nothing, for I saw that the subject was a peculiarly disturbing one.
Gossip, of course, was rife; but that was no novelty in connexion with the strange ménage at
the old Crowninshield house. One thing I did not like was what Derby‘s banker let fall in an
overexpansive mood at the Miskatonic Club—about the cheques Edward was sending
regularly to a Moses and Abigail Sargent and a Eunice Babson in Innsmouth. That looked as
if those evil-faced servants were extorting some kind of tribute from him—yet he had not
mentioned the matter to me.
I wished that the summer—and my son‘s Harvard vacation—would come, so that we could
get Edward to Europe. He was not, I soon saw, mending as rapidly as I had hoped he would;
for there was something a bit hysterical in his occasional exhilaration, while his moods of
fright and depression were altogether too frequent. The old Derby house was ready by
December, yet Edward constantly put off moving. Though he hated and seemed to fear the
Crowninshield place, he was at the same time queerly enslaved by it. He could not seem to
begin dismantling things, and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action. When I
pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened. His father‘s old butler—who
was there with other reacquired family servants—told me one day that Edward‘s occasional
prowlings about the house, and especially down cellar, looked odd and unwholesome to him. I
wondered if Asenath had been writing disturbing letters, but the butler said there was no mail
which could have come from her.
VI.
It was about Christmas that Derby broke down one evening while calling on me. I was
steering the conversation toward next summer‘s travels when he suddenly shrieked and
leaped up from his chair with a look of shocking, uncontrollable fright—a cosmic panic and
loathing such as only the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind.
―My brain! My brain! God, Dan—it‘s tugging—from beyond—knocking—clawing—that she-
devil—even now—Ephraim—Kamog! Kamog!—The pit of the shoggoths—Iä! Shub-
Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young! . . .
―The flame—the flame . . . beyond body, beyond life . . . in the earth . . . oh, God! . . .‖
I pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as his frenzy sank to a
dull apathy. He did not resist, but kept his lips moving as if talking to himself. Presently I
realised that he was trying to talk to me, and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble
words.
― . . . again, again . . . she‘s trying . . . I might have known . . . nothing can stop that force; not
distance, nor magic, nor death . . . it comes and comes, mostly in the night . . . I can‘t leave . .
. it‘s horrible . . . oh, God, Dan, if you only knew as I do just how horrible it is. . . .”
When he had slumped down into a stupor I propped him with pillows and let normal sleep
overtake him. I did not call a doctor, for I knew what would be said of his sanity, and wished to
give nature a chance if I possibly could. He waked at midnight, and I put him to bed upstairs,
but he was gone by morning. He had let himself quietly out of the house—and his butler,
when called on the wire, said he was at home pacing restlessly about the library.
Edward went to pieces rapidly after that. He did not call again, but I went daily to see him. He
would always be sitting in his library, staring at nothing and having an air of abnormal
listening. Sometimes he talked rationally, but always on trivial topics. Any mention of his
trouble, of future plans, or of Asenath would send him into a frenzy. His butler said he had
frightful seizures at night, during which he might eventually do himself harm.
I had a long talk with his doctor, banker, and lawyer, and finally took the physician with two
specialist colleagues to visit him. The spasms that resulted from the first questions were
violent and pitiable—and that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the
Arkham Sanitarium. I was made his guardian and called on him twice weekly—almost
weeping to hear his wild shrieks, awesome whispers, and dreadful, droning repetitions of
such phrases as ―I had to do it—I had to do it . . . it‘ll get me . . . it‘ll get me . . . down there . . .
down there in the dark. . . . Mother, mother! Dan! Save me . . . save me. . . .‖
How much hope of recovery there was, no one could say; but I tried my best to be optimistic.
Edward must have a home if he emerged, so I transferred his servants to the Derby mansion,
which would surely be his sane choice. What to do about the Crowninshield place with its
complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects I could not decide, so left
it momentarily untouched—telling the Derby housemaid to go over and dust the chief rooms
once a week, and ordering the furnace man to have a fire on those days.
The final nightmare came before Candlemas—heralded, in cruel irony, by a false gleam of
hope. One morning late in January the sanitarium telephoned to report that Edward‘s reason
had suddenly come back. His continuous memory, they said, was badly impaired; but sanity
itself was certain. Of course he must remain some time for observation, but there could be
little doubt of the outcome. All going well, he would surely be free in a week.
I hastened over in a flood of delight, but stood bewildered when a nurse took me to Edward‘s
room. The patient rose to greet me, extending his hand with a polite smile; but I saw in an
instant that he bore the strangely energised personality which had seemed so foreign to his
own nature—the competent personality I had found so vaguely horrible, and which Edward
himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife. There was the same blazing
vision—so like Asenath‘s and old Ephraim‘s—and the same firm mouth; and when he spoke I
could sense the same grim, pervasive irony in his voice—the deep irony so redolent of
potential evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the night five months
before—the person I had not seen since that brief call when he had forgotten the old-time
doorbell signal and stirred such nebulous fears in me—and now he filled me with the same
dim feeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness.
He spoke affably of arrangements for release—and there was nothing for me to do but
assent, despite some remarkable gaps in his recent memories. Yet I felt that something was
terribly, inexplicably wrong and abnormal. There were horrors in this thing that I could not
reach. This was a sane person—but was it indeed the Edward Derby I had known? If not, who
or what was it—and where was Edward? Ought it to be free or confined . . . or ought it to be
extirpated from the face of the earth? There was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything
the creature said—the Asenath-like eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to certain words
about the ‗early liberty earned by an especially close confinement’. I must have behaved very
awkwardly, and was glad to beat a retreat.
All that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem. What had happened? What sort
of mind looked out through those alien eyes in Edward‘s face? I could think of nothing but this
dimly terrible enigma, and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work. The second morning
the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged, and by evening I was
close to a nervous collapse—a state I admit, though others will vow it coloured my
subsequent vision. I have nothing to say on this point except that no madness of mine could
account for all the evidence.
VII.
It was in the night—after that second evening—that stark, utter horror burst over me and
weighted my spirit with a black, clutching panic from which it can never shake free. It began
with a telephone call just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the
receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go
to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone
trying under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid
bubbling noise—―glub . . . glub . . . glub”—which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate,
unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called, ―Who is it?‖ But the only answer was ―glub-
glub . . . glub-glub.” I could only assume that the noise was mechanical; but fancying that it
might be a case of a broken instrument able to receive but not to send, I added, ―I can‘t hear
you. Better hang up and try Information.‖ Immediately I heard the receiver go on the hook at
the other end.
This, I say, was just before midnight. When that call was traced afterward it was found to
come from the old Crowninshield house, though it was fully half a week from the housemaid‘s
day to be there. I shall only hint what was found at that house—the upheaval in a remote
cellar storeroom, the tracks, the dirt, the hastily rifled wardrobe, the baffling marks on the
telephone, the clumsily used stationery, and the detestable stench lingering over everything.
The police, poor fools, have their smug little theories, and are still searching for those sinister
discharged servants—who have dropped out of sight amidst the present furore. They speak of
a ghoulish revenge for things that were done, and say I was included because I was Edward‘s
best friend and adviser.
Idiots!—do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that handwriting? Do they fancy
they could have brought what later came? Are they blind to the changes in that body that was
Edward‘s? As for me, I now believe all that Edward Derby ever told me. There are horrors
beyond life‘s edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while man‘s evil prying calls them
just within our range. Ephraim—Asenath—that devil called them in, and they engulfed Edward
as they are engulfing me.
Can I be sure that I am safe? Those powers survive the life of the physical form. The next
day—in the afternoon, when I pulled out of my prostration and was able to walk and talk
coherently—I went to the madhouse and shot him dead for Edward‘s and the world‘s sake,
but can I be sure till he is cremated? They are keeping the body for some silly autopsies by
different doctors—but I say he must be cremated. He must be cremated—he who was not
Edward Derby when I shot him. I shall go mad if he is not, for I may be the next. But my will is
not weak—and I shall not let it be undermined by the terrors I know are seething around it.
One life—Ephraim, Asenath, and Edward—who now? I will not be driven out of my body . . . I
will not change souls with that bullet-ridden lich in the madhouse!
But let me try to tell coherently of that final horror. I will not speak of what the police
persistently ignored—the tales of that dwarfed, grotesque, malodorous thing met by at least
three wayfarers in High St. just before two o‘clock, and the nature of the single footprints in
certain places. I will say only that just about two the doorbell and knocker waked me—
doorbell and knocker both, plied alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation,
and each trying to keep to Edward’s old signal of three-and-two strokes.
Roused from sound sleep, my mind leaped into a turmoil. Derby at the door—and
remembering the old code! That new personality had not remembered it . . . was Edward
suddenly back in his rightful state? Why was he here in such evident stress and haste? Had
he been released ahead of time, or had he escaped? Perhaps, I thought as I flung on a robe
and bounded downstairs, his return to his own self had brought raving and violence, revoking
his discharge and driving him to a desperate dash for freedom. Whatever had happened, he
was good old Edward again, and I would help him!
When I opened the door into the elm-arched blackness a gust of insufferably foetid wind
almost flung me prostrate. I choked in nausea, and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed,
humped figure on the steps. The summons had been Edward‘s, but who was this foul, stunted
parody? Where had Edward had time to go? His ring had sounded only a second before the
door opened.
The caller had on one of Edward‘s overcoats—its bottom almost touching the ground, and its
sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands. On the head was a slouch hat pulled low,
while a black silk muffler concealed the face. As I stepped unsteadily forward, the figure made
a semi-liquid sound like that I had heard over the telephone—―glub . . . glub . . .”—and thrust
at me a large, closely written paper impaled on the end of a long pencil. Still reeling from the
morbid and unaccountable foetor, I seized this paper and tried to read it in the light from the
doorway.
Beyond question, it was in Edward‘s script. But why had he written when he was close
enough to ring—and why was the script so awkward, coarse, and shaky? I could make out
nothing in the dim half light, so edged back into the hall, the dwarf figure clumping
mechanically after but pausing on the inner door‘s threshold. The odour of this singular
messenger was really appalling, and I hoped (not in vain, thank God!) that my wife would not
wake and confront it.
Then, as I read the paper, I felt my knees give under me and my vision go black. I was lying
on the floor when I came to, that accursed sheet still clutched in my fear-rigid hand. This is
what it said.
―Dan—go to the sanitarium and kill it. Exterminate it. It isn‘t Edward Derby any
more. She got me—it‘s Asenath—and she has been dead three months and a half.
I lied when I said she had gone away. I killed her. I had to. It was sudden, but we
were alone and I was in my right body. I saw a candlestick and smashed her head
in. She would have got me for good at Hallowmass.
―I buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and cleaned up
all the traces. The servants suspected next morning, but they have such secrets
that they dare not tell the police. I sent them off, but God knows what they—and
others of the cult—will do.
―I thought for a while I was all right, and then I felt the tugging at my brain. I knew
what it was—I ought to have remembered. A soul like hers—or Ephraim‘s—is half
detached, and keeps right on after death as long as the body lasts. She was
getting me—making me change bodies with her—seizing my body and putting me
in that corpse of hers buried in the cellar.
―I knew what was coming—that‘s why I snapped and had to go to the asylum. Then
it came—I found myself choked in the dark—in Asenath‘s rotting carcass down
there in the cellar under the boxes where I put it. And I knew she must be in my
body at the sanitarium—permanently, for it was after Hallowmass, and the sacrifice
would work even without her being there—sane, and ready for release as a
menace to the world. I was desperate, and in spite of everything I clawed my way
out.
―I‘m too far gone to talk—I couldn‘t manage to telephone—but I can still write. I‘ll
get fixed up somehow and bring you this last word and warning. Kill that fiend if
you value the peace and comfort of the world. See that it is cremated. If you don‘t,
it will live on and on, body to body forever, and I can‘t tell you what it will do. Keep
clear of black magic, Dan, it‘s the devil‘s business. Goodbye—you‘ve been a great
friend. Tell the police whatever they‘ll believe—and I‘m damnably sorry to drag all
this on you. I‘ll be at peace before long—this thing won‘t hold together much more.
Hope you can read this. And kill that thing—kill it.
Yours—Ed.‖
It was only afterward that I read the last half of this paper, for I had fainted at the end of the
third paragraph. I fainted again when I saw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where
the warm air had struck it. The messenger would not move or have consciousness any more.
The butler, tougher-fibred than I, did not faint at what met him in the hall in the morning.
Instead, he telephoned the police. When they came I had been taken upstairs to bed, but
the—other mass—lay where it had collapsed in the night. The men put handkerchiefs to their
noses.
What they finally found inside Edward‘s oddly assorted clothes was mostly liquescent horror.
There were bones, too—and a crushed-in skull. Some dental work positively identified the
skull as Asenath‘s.

The Evil Clergyman
(1933)
I was shewn into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man with quiet clothes and
an iron-grey beard, who spoke to me in this fashion:
―Yes, he lived here—but I don‘t advise your doing anything. Your curiosity makes you
irresponsible. We never come here at night, and it‘s only because of his will that we keep it
this way. You know what he did. That abominable society took charge at last, and we don‘t
know where he is buried. There was no way the law or anything else could reach the society.
―I hope you won‘t stay till after dark. And I beg of you to let that thing on the table—the thing
that looks like a match box—alone. We don‘t know what it is, but we suspect it has something
to do with what he did. We even avoid looking at it very steadily.‖
After a time the man left me alone in the attic room. It was very dingy and dusty, and only
primitively furnished, but it had a neatness which shewed it was not a slum-denizen‘s
quarters. There were shelves full of theological and classical books, and another bookcase
containing treatises on magic—Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, Trithemius, Hermes
Trismegistus, Borellus, and others in strange alphabets whose titles I could not decipher. The
furniture was very plain. There was a door, but it led only into a closet. The only egress was
the aperture in the floor up to which the crude, steep staircase led. The windows were of
bull‘s-eye pattern, and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity. Plainly, this
house was of the old world. I seemed to know where I was, but cannot recall what I then
knew. Certainly the town was not London. My impression is of a small seaport.
The small object on the table fascinated me intensely. I seemed to know what to do with it, for
I drew a pocket electric light—or what looked like one—out of my pocket and nervously tested
its flashes. The light was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some
radio-active bombardment. I recall that I did not regard it as a common flashlight—indeed, I
had a common flashlight in another pocket.
It was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside looked very queer
through the bull‘s-eye window-panes. Finally I summoned up courage and propped the small
object up on the table against a book—then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it.
The light seemed now to be more like a rain or hail of small violet particles than like a
continuous beam. As the particles struck the glassy surface at the centre of the strange
device, they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube
through which sparks are passed. The dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow, and a
vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its centre. Then I noticed that I was not alone
in the room—and put the ray-projector back in my pocket.
But the newcomer did not speak—nor did I hear any sound whatever during all the
immediately following moments. Everything was shadowy pantomime, as if seen at a vast
distance through some intervening haze—although on the other hand the newcomer and all
subsequent comers loomed large and close, as if both near and distant, according to some
abnormal geometry.
The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the
Anglican church. He was apparently about thirty years old, with a sallow, olive complexion
and fairly good features, but an abnormally high forehead. His black hair was well cut and
neatly brushed, and he was clean-shaven though blue-chinned with a heavy growth of beard.
He wore rimless spectacles with steel bows. His build and lower facial features were like other
clergymen I had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more
intelligent-looking—also more subtly and concealedly evil-looking. At the present moment—
having just lighted a faint oil lamp—he looked nervous, and before I knew it he was casting all
his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted
sharply) which I had not noticed before. The flames devoured the volumes greedily—leaping
up in strange colours and emitting indescribably hideous odours as the strangely
hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element. All at once I
saw there were others in the room—grave-looking men in clerical costume, one of whom
wore the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop. Though I could hear nothing, I could see that
they were bringing a decision of vast import to the first-comer. They seemed to hate and fear
him at the same time, and he seemed to return these sentiments. His face set itself into a
grim expression, but I could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair.
The bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace (where the flames had died down
amidst a charred, non-committal mass), and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing. The first-
comer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the
table. Everyone then seemed frightened. The procession of clerics began filing down the
steep stairs through the trap-door in the floor, turning and making menacing gestures as they
left. The bishop was last to go.
The first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of
rope. Mounting a chair, he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed
central beam of black oak, and began making a noose with the other end. Realising he was
about to hang himself, I started forward to dissuade or save him. He saw me and ceased his
preparations, looking at me with a kind of triumph which puzzled and disturbed me. He slowly
stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his
dark, thin-lipped face.
I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a weapon of
defence. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know. I turned it on—full in his face, and saw
the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light. His expression of wolfish
exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear—which did not, however,
wholly displace the exultation. He stopped in his tracks—then, flailing his arms wildly in the
air, began to stagger backward. I saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in the floor,
and tried to shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In another instant he had lurched
backward through the opening and was lost to view.
I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get there I found no crushed
body on the floor below. Instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the
spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as
normally tri-dimensional. Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place. Had there
been a noise I had not heard? Presently the two people (simply villagers, apparently) farthest
in the lead saw me—and stood paralysed. One of them shrieked loudly and reverberently:
―Ahrrh! . . . It be ‘ee, zur? Again?‖
Then they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When the crowd was gone I saw
the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place—standing alone with a lantern. He
was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid. Then he began to
ascend the stairs, and joined me in the attic. He spoke:
―So you didn’t let it alone! I‘m sorry. I know what has happened. It happened once before, but
the man got frightened and shot himself. You ought not to have made him come back. You
know what he wants. But you mustn‘t get frightened like the other man he got. Something
very strange and terrible has happened to you, but it didn‘t get far enough to hurt your mind
and personality. If you‘ll keep cool, and accept the need for making certain radical
readjustments in your life, you can keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your
scholarship. But you can‘t live here—and I don‘t think you‘ll wish to go back to London. I‘d
advise America.
―You mustn‘t try anything more with that—thing. Nothing can be put back now. It would only
make matters worse to do—or summon—anything. You are not as badly off as you might
be—but you must get out of here at once and stay away. You‘d better thank heaven it didn‘t
go further. . . .
―I‘m going to prepare you as bluntly as I can. There‘s been a certain change—in your personal
appearance. He always causes that. But in a new country you can get used to it. There‘s a
mirror up at the other end of the room, and I‘m going to take you to it. You‘ll get a shock—
though you will see nothing repulsive.‖
I was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he
walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp (i.e., that formerly on the table, not
the still fainter lantern he had brought) in his free hand. This is what I saw in the glass:
A thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church,
apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel-bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow,
olive forehead of abnormal height.
It was the silent first-comer who had burned his books.
For all the rest of my life, in outward form, I was to be that man!

The Book
(1933)
My memories are very confused. There is even much doubt as to where they begin; for at
times I feel appalling vistas of years stretching behind me, while at other times it seems as if
the present moment were an isolated point in a grey, formless infinity. I am not even certain
how I am communicating this message. While I know I am speaking, I have a vague
impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what I
say to the points where I wish to be heard. My identity, too, is bewilderingly cloudy. I seem to
have suffered a great shock—perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of
unique, incredible experience.
These cycles of experience, of course, all stem from that worm-riddled book. I remember
when I found it—in a dimly lighted place near the black, oily river where the mists always
swirl. That place was very old, and the ceiling-high shelves full of rotting volumes reached
back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves. There were, besides, great
formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins; and it was in one of these heaps that I
found the thing. I never learned its title, for the early pages were missing; but it fell open
toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling.
There was a formula—a sort of list of things to say and do—which I recognised as something
black and forbidden; something which I had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed
abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universe‘s
guarded secrets whose decaying texts I loved to absorb. It was a key—a guide—to certain
gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was
young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms
of life and matter that we know. Not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or
known where to find it, but this book was very old indeed. No printing-press, but the hand of
some half-crazed monk, had traced these ominous Latin phrases in uncials of awesome
antiquity.
I remember how the old man leered and tittered, and made a curious sign with his hand when
I bore it away. He had refused to take pay for it, and only long afterward did I guess why. As I
hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist-choked waterfront streets I had a frightful
impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet. The centuried, tottering houses
on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignity—as if some hitherto closed
channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened. I felt that those walls and
overhanging gables of mildewed brick and fungous plaster and timber—with fishy, eye-like,
diamond-paned windows that leered—could hardly desist from advancing and crushing me . .
. yet I had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and
bringing it away.
I remember how I read the book at last—white-faced, and locked in the attic room that I had
long devoted to strange searchings. The great house was very still, for I had not gone up till
after midnight. I think I had a family then—though the details are very uncertain—and I know
there were many servants. Just what the year was, I cannot say; for since then I have known
many ages and dimensions, and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned. It
was by the light of candles that I read—I recall the relentless dripping of the wax—and there
were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries. I seemed to keep track of
those chimes with a peculiar intentness, as if I feared to hear some very remote, intruding
note among them.
Then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above
the other roofs of the city. It came as I droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay, and I
knew amidst my shudders what it meant. For he who passes the gateways always wins a
shadow, and never again can he be alone. I had evoked—and the book was indeed all I had
suspected. That night I passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision, and when
morning found me in the attic room I saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which I had
never seen before.
Nor could I ever after see the world as I had known it. Mixed with the present scene was
always a little of the past and a little of the future, and every once-familiar object loomed alien
in the new perspective brought by my widened sight. From then on I walked in a fantastic
dream of unknown and half-known shapes; and with each new gateway crossed, the less
plainly could I recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which I had so long been bound.
What I saw about me none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought mad.
Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side. But still I
read more—in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me—and
pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life-patterns toward the core of the
unknown cosmos.
I remember the night I made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the
innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from Tartary had brought. The
walls melted away, and I was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the
needle-like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me. After a while there was utter
blackness, and then the light of myriad stars forming strange, alien constellations. Finally I
saw a green-litten plain far below me, and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in
no fashion I had ever known or read of or dreamed of. As I floated closer to that city I saw a
great square building of stone in an open space, and felt a hideous fear clutching at me. I
screamed and struggled, and after a blankness was again in my attic room, sprawled flat over
the five phosphorescent circles on the floor. In that night‘s wandering there was no more of
strangeness than in many a former night‘s wandering; but there was more of terror because I
knew I was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than I had ever been before. Thereafter I
was more cautious with my incantations, for I had no wish to be cut off from my body and from
the earth in unknown abysses whence I could never return.

The Shadow Out of Time
(1934)
I.
After twenty-two years of nightmare and terror, saved only by a desperate conviction of the
mythical source of certain impressions, I am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which I
think I found in Western Australia on the night of July 17–18, 1935. There is reason to hope
that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucination—for which, indeed, abundant causes
existed. And yet, its realism was so hideous that I sometimes find hope impossible. If the thing
did happen, then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos, and of his own
place in the seething vortex of time, whose merest mention is paralysing. He must, too, be
placed on guard against a specific lurking peril which, though it will never engulf the whole
race, may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members
of it. It is for this latter reason that I urge, with all the force of my being, a final abandonment
of all attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown, primordial masonry which my
expedition set out to investigate.
Assuming that I was sane and awake, my experience on that night was such as has befallen
no man before. It was, moreover, a frightful confirmation of all I had sought to dismiss as myth
and dream. Mercifully there is no proof, for in my fright I lost the awesome object which
would—if real and brought out of that noxious abyss—have formed irrefutable evidence.
When I came upon the horror I was alone—and I have up to now told no one about it. I could
not stop the others from digging in its direction, but chance and the shifting sand have so far
saved them from finding it. Now I must formulate some definitive statement—not only for the
sake of my own mental balance, but to warn such others as may read it seriously.
These pages—much in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the general and
scientific press—are written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing me home. I shall give them
to my son, Prof. Wingate Peaslee of Miskatonic University—the only member of my family
who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago, and the man best informed on the inner
facts of my case. Of all living persons, he is least likely to ridicule what I shall tell of that fateful
night. I did not enlighten him orally before sailing, because I think he had better have the
revelation in written form. Reading and re-reading at leisure will leave with him a more
convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey. He can do as he thinks
best with this account—shewing it, with suitable comment, to any quarters where it will be
likely to accomplish good. It is for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier
phases of my case that I am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its
background.
My name is Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, and those who recall the newspaper tales of a
generation back—or the letters and articles in psychological journals six or seven years ago—
will know who and what I am. The press was filled with the details of my strange amnesia in
1908–13, and much was made of the traditions of horror, madness, and witchcraft which lurk
behind the ancient Massachusetts town then and now forming my place of residence. Yet I
would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and
early life. This is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly upon me
from outside sources. It may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling,
whisper-haunted Arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadows—though even this
seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which I later came to study. But the chief point
is that my own ancestry and background are altogether normal. What came, came from
somewhere else—where, I even now hesitate to assert in plain words.
I am the son of Jonathan and Hannah (Wingate) Peaslee, both of wholesome old Haverhill
stock. I was born and reared in Haverhill—at the old homestead in Boardman Street near
Golden Hill—and did not go to Arkham till I entered Miskatonic University at the age of
eighteen. That was in 1889. After my graduation I studied economics at Harvard, and came
back to Miskatonic as Instructor of Political Economy in 1895. For thirteen years more my life
ran smoothly and happily. I married Alice Keezar of Haverhill in 1896, and my three children,
Robert K., Wingate, and Hannah, were born in 1898, 1900, and 1903, respectively. In 1898 I
became an associate professor, and in 1902 a full professor. At no time had I the least interest
in either occultism or abnormal psychology.
It was on Thursday, May 14, 1908, that the queer amnesia came. The thing was quite sudden,
though later I realised that certain brief, glimmering visions of several hours previous—chaotic
visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented—must have formed
premonitory symptoms. My head was aching, and I had a singular feeling—altogether new to
me—that someone else was trying to get possession of my thoughts.
The collapse occurred about 10:20 a.m., while I was conducting a class in Political Economy
VI—history and present tendencies of economics—for juniors and a few sophomores. I began
to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than
the classroom. My thoughts and speech wandered from my subject, and the students saw
that something was gravely amiss. Then I slumped down, unconscious in my chair, in a stupor
from which no one could arouse me. Nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the
daylight of our normal world for five years, four months, and thirteen days.
It is, of course, from others that I have learned what followed. I shewed no sign of
consciousness for sixteen and a half hours, though removed to my home at 27 Crane St. and
given the best of medical attention. At 3 a.m. May 15 my eyes opened and I began to speak,
but before long the doctors and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my
expression and language. It was clear that I had no remembrance of my identity or of my
past, though for some reason I seemed anxious to conceal this lack of knowledge. My eyes
gazed strangely at the persons around me, and the flexions of my facial muscles were
altogether unfamiliar.
Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign. I used my vocal organs clumsily and
gropingly, and my diction had a curiously stilted quality, as if I had laboriously learned the
English language from books. The pronunciation was barbarously alien, whilst the idiom
seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly
incomprehensible cast. Of the latter one in particular was very potently—even terrifiedly—
recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period such
a phrase began to have an actual currency—first in England and then in the United States—
and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least
particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908.
Physical strength returned at once, although I required an odd amount of re-education in the
use of my hands, legs, and bodily apparatus in general. Because of this and other handicaps
inherent in the mnemonic lapse, I was for some time kept under strict medical care. When I
saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed, I admitted it openly, and became eager
for information of all sorts. Indeed, it seemed to the doctors that I had lost interest in my
proper personality as soon as I found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing. They
noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history, science, art, language,
and folklore—some of them tremendously abstruse, and some childishly simple—which
remained, very oddly in many cases, outside my consciousness.
At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown
sorts of knowledge—a command which I seemed to wish to hide rather than display. I would
inadvertently refer, with casual assurance, to specific events in dim ages outside the range of
accepted history—passing off such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created.
And I had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright. These
uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear, though some observers laid their vanishment more
to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind
them. Indeed, I seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech, customs, and perspectives
of the age around me; as if I were a studious traveller from a far, foreign land.
As soon as permitted, I haunted the college library at all hours; and shortly began to arrange
for those odd travels, and special courses at American and European universities, which
evoked so much comment during the next few years. I did not at any time suffer from a lack of
learned contacts, for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period. I
was lectured upon as a typical example of secondary personality—even though I seemed to
puzzle the lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptom or some queer trace of
carefully veiled mockery.
Of real friendliness, however, I encountered little. Something in my aspect and speech
seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in everyone I met, as if I were a being infinitely
removed from all that is normal and healthful. This idea of a black, hidden horror connected
with incalculable gulfs of some sort of distance was oddly widespread and persistent. My own
family formed no exception. From the moment of my strange waking my wife had regarded
me with extreme horror and loathing, vowing that I was some utter alien usurping the body of
her husband. In 1910 she obtained a legal divorce, nor would she ever consent to see me
even after my return to normalcy in 1913. These feelings were shared by my elder son and
my small daughter, neither of whom I have ever seen since.
Only my second son Wingate seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion which my
change aroused. He indeed felt that I was a stranger, but though only eight years old held fast
to a faith that my proper self would return. When it did return he sought me out, and the courts
gave me his custody. In succeeding years he helped me with the studies to which I was
driven, and today at thirty-five he is a professor of psychology at Miskatonic. But I do not
wonder at the horror I caused—for certainly, the mind, voice, and facial expression of the
being that awaked on May 15, 1908 were not those of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee.
I will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913, since readers may glean all the
outward essentials—as I largely had to do—from files of old newspapers and scientific
journals. I was given charge of my funds, and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely, in
travel and in study at various centres of learning. My travels, however, were singular in the
extreme; involving long visits to remote and desolate places. In 1909 I spent a month in the
Himalayas, and in 1911 aroused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown
deserts of Arabia. What happened on those journeys I have never been able to learn. During
the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic north of Spitzbergen, afterward
shewing signs of disappointment. Later in that year I spent weeks alone beyond the limits of
previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western
Virginia—black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered.
My sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation, as if the
secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own. I have found, also,
that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal. I could master every detail of a
book merely by glancing over it as fast as I could turn the leaves; while my skill at interpreting
complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome. At times there appeared almost ugly
reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others, though I seemed to have
taken care to minimise displays of this faculty.
Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, and scholars
suspected of connexion with nameless bands of abhorrent elder-world hierophants. These
rumours, though never proved at the time, were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of
some of my reading—for the consultation of rare books at libraries cannot be effected
secretly. There is tangible proof—in the form of marginal notes—that I went minutely through
such things as the Comte d‘Erlette‘s Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn‘s De Vermis Mysteriis,
the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the surviving fragments of the puzzling Book of
Eibon, and the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Then, too, it is
undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my
odd mutation.
In the summer of 1913 I began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest, and to hint to
various associates that a change might soon be expected in me. I spoke of returning
memories of my earlier life—though most auditors judged me insincere, since all the
recollections I gave were casual, and such as might have been learned from my old private
papers. About the middle of August I returned to Arkham and reopened my long-closed house
in Crane St. Here I installed a mechanism of the most curious aspect, constructed piecemeal
by different makers of scientific apparatus in Europe and America, and guarded carefully from
the sight of anyone intelligent enough to analyse it. Those who did see it—a workman, a
servant, and the new housekeeper—say that it was a queer mixture of rods, wheels, and
mirrors, though only about two feet tall, one foot wide, and one foot thick. The central mirror
was circular and convex. All this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be located.
On the evening of Friday, Sept. 26, I dismissed the housekeeper and the maid till noon of the
next day. Lights burned in the house till late, and a lean, dark, curiously foreign-looking man
called in an automobile. It was about 1 a.m. that the lights were last seen. At 2:15 a.m. a
policeman observed the place in darkness, but with the stranger‘s motor still at the curb. By
four o‘clock the motor was certainly gone. It was at six that a hesitant, foreign voice on the
telephone asked Dr. Wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint. This
call—a long-distance one—was later traced to a public booth in the North Station in Boston,
but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed.
When the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sitting-room—in an
easy-chair with a table drawn up before it. On the polished table-top were scratches shewing
where some heavy object had rested. The queer machine was gone, nor was anything
afterward heard of it. Undoubtedly the dark, lean foreigner had taken it away. In the library
grate were abundant ashes evidently left from the burning of every remaining scrap of paper
on which I had written since the advent of the amnesia. Dr. Wilson found my breathing very
peculiar, but after an hypodermic injection it became more regular.
At 11:15 a.m., Sept. 27, I stirred vigorously, and my hitherto mask-like face began to shew
signs of expression. Dr. Wilson remarked that the expression was not that of my secondary
personality, but seemed much like that of my normal self. About 11:30 I muttered some very
curious syllables—syllables which seemed unrelated to any human speech. I appeared, too,
to struggle against something. Then, just after noon—the housekeeper and the maid having
meanwhile returned—I began to mutter in English.
―. . . of the orthodox economists of that period, Jevons typifies the prevailing trend toward
scientific correlation. His attempt to link the commercial cycle of prosperity and depression
with the physical cycle of the solar spots forms perhaps the apex of . . .‖
Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee had come back—a spirit in whose time-scale it was still that
Thursday morning in 1908, with the economics class gazing up at the battered desk on the
platform.
II.
My reabsorption into normal life was a painful and difficult process. The loss of over five years
creates more complications than can be imagined, and in my case there were countless
matters to be adjusted. What I heard of my actions since 1908 astonished and disturbed me,
but I tried to view the matter as philosophically as I could. At last regaining custody of my
second son Wingate, I settled down with him in the Crane Street house and endeavoured to
resume teaching—my old professorship having been kindly offered me by the college.
I began work with the February, 1914, term, and kept at it just a year. By that time I realised
how badly my experience had shaken me. Though perfectly sane—I hoped—and with no flaw
in my original personality, I had not the nervous energy of the old days. Vague dreams and
queer ideas continually haunted me, and when the outbreak of the world war turned my mind
to history I found myself thinking of periods and events in the oddest possible fashion. My
conception of time—my ability to distinguish between consecutiveness and
simultaneousness—seemed subtly disordered; so that I formed chimerical notions about
living in one age and casting one‘s mind all over eternity for knowledge of past and future
ages.
The war gave me strange impressions of remembering some of its far-off consequences—as
if I knew how it was coming out and could look back upon it in the light of future information.
All such quasi-memories were attended with much pain, and with a feeling that some artificial
psychological barrier was set against them. When I diffidently hinted to others about my
impressions I met with varied responses. Some persons looked uncomfortably at me, but men
in the mathematics department spoke of new developments in those theories of relativity—
then discussed only in learned circles—which were later to become so famous. Dr. Albert
Einstein, they said, was rapidly reducing time to the status of a mere dimension.
But the dreams and disturbed feelings gained on me, so that I had to drop my regular work in
1915. Certain of the impressions were taking an annoying shape—giving me the persistent
notion that my amnesia had formed some unholy sort of exchange; that the secondary
personality had indeed been an intruding force from unknown regions, and that my own
personality had suffered displacement. Thus I was driven to vague and frightful speculations
concerning the whereabouts of my true self during the years that another had held my body.
The curious knowledge and strange conduct of my body‘s late tenant troubled me more and
more as I learned further details from persons, papers, and magazines. Queernesses that had
baffled others seemed to harmonise terribly with some background of black knowledge which
festered in the chasms of my subconscious. I began to search feverishly for every scrap of
information bearing on the studies and travels of that other one during the dark years.
Not all of my troubles were as semi-abstract as this. There were the dreams—and these
seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness. Knowing how most would regard them, I
seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists, but eventually
I commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or non-typical such
visions might be among amnesia victims. My results, aided by psychologists, historians,
anthropologists, and mental specialists of wide experience, and by a study that included all
records of split personalities from the days of daemoniac-possession legends to the medically
realistic present, at first bothered me more than they consoled me.
I soon found that my dreams had indeed no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true
amnesia cases. There remained, however, a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled
and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience. Some of them were bits of
ancient folklore; others were case-histories in the annals of medicine; one or two were
anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories. It thus appeared that, while my special kind
of affliction was prodigiously rare, instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the
beginning of man‘s annals. Some centuries might contain one, two, or three cases; others
none—or at least none whose record survived.
The essence was always the same—a person of keen thoughtfulness seized with a strange
secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at
first by vocal and bodily awkwardness, and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific,
historic, artistic, and anthropological knowledge; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest
and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power. Then a sudden return of the rightful
consciousness, intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting
fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out. And the close resemblance of
those nightmares to my own—even in some of the smallest particulars—left no doubt in my
mind of their significantly typical nature. One or two of the cases had an added ring of faint,
blasphemous familiarity, as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too
morbid and frightful to contemplate. In three instances there was specific mention of such an
unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change.
Another thing that cloudily worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater
frequency of cases where a brief, elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to
persons not visited with well-defined amnesia. These persons were largely of mediocre mind
or less—some so primitive that they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles for abnormal
scholarship and preternatural mental acquisitions. For a second they would be fired with alien
force—then a backward lapse and a thin, swift-fading memory of un-human horrors.
There had been at least three such cases during the past half century—one only fifteen years
before. Had something been groping blindly through time from some unsuspected abyss in
Nature? Were these faint cases monstrous, sinister experiments of a kind and authorship
utterly beyond sane belief? Such were a few of the formless speculations of my weaker
hours—fancies abetted by myths which my studies uncovered. For I could not doubt but that
certain persistent legends of immemorial antiquity, apparently unknown to the victims and
physicians connected with recent amnesia cases, formed a striking and awesome elaboration
of memory lapses such as mine.
Of the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous I still almost
fear to speak. They seemed to savour of madness, and at times I believed I was indeed going
mad. Was there a special type of delusion afflicting those who had suffered lapses of
memory? Conceivably, the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with
pseudo-memories might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries. This, indeed (though an
alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible), was the belief of many of the
alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases, and who shared my puzzlement at
the exact resemblances sometimes discovered. They did not call the condition true insanity,
but classed it rather among neurotic disorders. My course in trying to track it down and
analyse it, instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it, they heartily endorsed as correct
according to the best psychological principles. I especially valued the advice of such
physicians as had studied me during my possession by the other personality.
My first disturbances were not visual at all, but concerned the more abstract matters which I
have mentioned. There was, too, a feeling of profound and inexplicable horror concerning
myself. I developed a queer fear of seeing my own form, as if my eyes would find it something
utterly alien and inconceivably abhorrent. When I did glance down and behold the familiar
human shape in quiet grey or blue clothing I always felt a curious relief, though in order to
gain this relief I had to conquer an infinite dread. I shunned mirrors as much as possible, and
was always shaved at the barber‘s.
It was a long time before I correlated any of these disappointed feelings with the fleeting
visual impressions which began to develop. The first such correlation had to do with the odd
sensation of an external, artificial restraint on my memory. I felt that the snatches of sight I
experienced had a profound and terrible meaning, and a frightful connexion with myself, but
that some purposeful influence held me from grasping that meaning and that connexion. Then
came that queerness about the element of time, and with it desperate efforts to place the
fragmentary dream-glimpses in the chronological and spatial pattern.
The glimpses themselves were at first merely strange rather than horrible. I would seem to be
in an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groinings were well-nigh lost in the
shadows overhead. In whatever time or place the scene might be, the principle of the arch
was known as fully and used as extensively as by the Romans. There were colossal round
windows and high arched doors, and pedestals or tables each as tall as the height of an
ordinary room. Vast shelves of dark wood lined the walls, holding what seemed to be volumes
of immense size with strange hieroglyphs on their backs. The exposed stonework held
curious carvings, always in curvilinear mathematical designs, and there were chiselled
inscriptions in the same characters that the huge books bore. The dark granite masonry was
of a monstrous megalithic type, with lines of convex-topped blocks fitting the concave-
bottomed courses which rested upon them. There were no chairs, but the tops of the vast
pedestals were littered with books, papers, and what seemed to be writing materials—oddly
figured jars of a purplish metal, and rods with stained tips. Tall as the pedestals were, I
seemed at times able to view them from above. On some of them were great globes of
luminous crystal serving as lamps, and inexplicable machines formed of vitreous tubes and
metal rods. The windows were glazed, and latticed with stout-looking bars. Though I dared
not approach and peer out them, I could see from where I was the waving tops of singular
fern-like growths. The floor was of massive octagonal flagstones, while rugs and hangings
were entirely lacking.
Later I had visions of sweeping through Cyclopean corridors of stone, and up and down
gigantic inclined planes of the same monstrous masonry. There were no stairs anywhere, nor
was any passageway less than thirty feet wide. Some of the structures through which I floated
must have towered into the sky for thousands of feet. There were multiple levels of black
vaults below, and never-opened trap-doors, sealed down with metal bands and holding dim
suggestions of some special peril. I seemed to be a prisoner, and horror hung broodingly over
everything I saw. I felt that the mocking curvilinear hieroglyphs on the walls would blast my
soul with their message were I not guarded by a merciful ignorance.
Still later my dreams included vistas from the great round windows, and from the titanic flat
roof, with its curious gardens, wide barren area, and high, scalloped parapet of stone, to
which the topmost of the inclined planes led. There were almost endless leagues of giant
buildings, each in its garden, and ranged along paved roads fully two hundred feet wide. They
differed greatly in aspect, but few were less than five hundred feet square or a thousand feet
high. Many seemed so limitless that they must have had a frontage of several thousand feet,
while some shot up to mountainous altitudes in the grey, steamy heavens. They seemed to be
mainly of stone or concrete, and most of them embodied the oddly curvilinear type of masonry
noticeable in the building that held me. Roofs were flat and garden-covered, and tended to
have scalloped parapets. Sometimes there were terraces and higher levels, and wide cleared
spaces amidst the gardens. The great roads held hints of motion, but in the earlier visions I
could not resolve this impression into details.
In certain places I beheld enormous dark cylindrical towers which climbed far above any of
the other structures. These appeared to be of a totally unique nature, and shewed signs of
prodigious age and dilapidation. They were built of a bizarre type of square-cut basalt
masonry, and tapered slightly toward their rounded tops. Nowhere in any of them could the
least traces of windows or other apertures save huge doors be found. I noticed also some
lower buildings—all crumbling with the weathering of aeons—which resembled these dark
cylindrical towers in basic architecture. Around all these aberrant piles of square-cut masonry
there hovered an inexplicable aura of menace and concentrated fear, like that bred by the
sealed trap-doors.
The omnipresent gardens were almost terrifying in their strangeness, with bizarre and
unfamiliar forms of vegetation nodding over broad paths lined with curiously carven monoliths.
Abnormally vast fern-like growths predominated; some green, and some of a ghastly, fungoid
pallor. Among them rose great spectral things resembling calamites, whose bamboo-like
trunks towered to fabulous heights. Then there were tufted forms like fabulous cycads, and
grotesque dark-green shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect. Flowers were small, colourless,
and unrecognisable, blooming in geometrical beds and at large among the greenery. In a few
of the terrace and roof-top gardens were larger and more vivid blossoms of almost offensive
contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding. Fungi of inconceivable size, outlines, and
colours speckled the scene in patterns bespeaking some unknown but well-established
horticultural tradition. In the larger gardens on the ground there seemed to be some attempt
to preserve the irregularities of Nature, but on the roofs there was more selectiveness, and
more evidences of the topiary art.
The skies were almost always moist and cloudy, and sometimes I would seem to witness
tremendous rains. Once in a while, though, there would be glimpses of the sun—which looked
abnormally large—and of the moon, whose markings held a touch of difference from the
normal that I could never quite fathom. When—very rarely—the night sky was clear to any
extent, I beheld constellations which were nearly beyond recognition. Known outlines were
sometimes approximated, but seldom duplicated; and from the position of the few groups I
could recognise, I felt I must be in the earth‘s southern hemisphere, near the Tropic of
Capricorn. The far horizon was always steamy and indistinct, but I could see that great
jungles of unknown tree-ferns, calamites, lepidodendra, and sigillaria lay outside the city, their
fantastic frondage waving mockingly in the shifting vapours. Now and then there would be
suggestions of motion in the sky, but these my early visions never resolved.
By the autumn of 1914 I began to have infrequent dreams of strange floatings over the city
and through the regions around it. I saw interminable roads through forests of fearsome
growths with mottled, fluted, and banded trunks, and past other cities as strange as the one
which persistently haunted me. I saw monstrous constructions of black or iridescent stone in
glades and clearings where perpetual twilight reigned, and traversed long causeways over
swamps so dark that I could tell but little of their moist, towering vegetation. Once I saw an
area of countless miles strown with age-blasted basaltic ruins whose architecture had been
like that of the few windowless, round-topped towers in the haunting city. And once I saw the
sea—a boundless steamy expanse beyond the colossal stone piers of an enormous town of
domes and arches. Great shapeless suggestions of shadow moved over it, and here and
there its surface was vexed with anomalous spoutings.
III.
As I have said, it was not immediately that these wild visions began to hold their terrifying
quality. Certainly, many persons have dreamed intrinsically stranger things—things
compounded of unrelated scraps of daily life, pictures, and reading, and arranged in
fantastically novel forms by the unchecked caprices of sleep. For some time I accepted the
visions as natural, even though I had never before been an extravagant dreamer. Many of the
vague anomalies, I argued, must have come from trivial sources too numerous to track down;
while others seemed to reflect a common text-book knowledge of the plants and other
conditions of the primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years ago—the world of the
Permian or Triassic age. In the course of some months, however, the element of terror did
figure with accumulating force. This was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the
aspect of memories, and when my mind began to link them with my growing abstract
disturbances—the feeling of mnemonic restraint, the curious impressions regarding time, the
sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary personality of 1908–13, and, considerably
later, the inexplicable loathing of my own person.
As certain definite details began to enter the dreams, their horror increased a thousandfold—
until by October, 1915, I felt I must do something. It was then that I began an intensive study
of other cases of amnesia and visions, feeling that I might thereby objectivise my trouble and
shake clear of its emotional grip. However, as before mentioned, the result was at first almost
exactly opposite. It disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely
duplicated; especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological
knowledge—and therefore of any idea of primitive landscapes—on the subjects‘ part. What is
more, many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and explanations in connexion
with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardens—and other things. The actual sights
and vague impressions were bad enough, but what was hinted or asserted by some of the
other dreamers savoured of madness and blasphemy. Worst of all, my own pseudo-memory
was aroused to wilder dreams and hints of coming revelations. And yet most doctors deemed
my course, on the whole, an advisable one.
I studied psychology systematically, and under the prevailing stimulus my son Wingate did the
same—his studies leading eventually to his present professorship. In 1917 and 1918 I took
special courses at Miskatonic. Meanwhile my examination of medical, historical, and
anthropological records became indefatigable; involving travels to distant libraries, and finally
including even a reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary
personality had been so disturbingly interested. Some of the latter were the actual copies I
had consulted in my altered state, and I was greatly disturbed by certain marginal notations
and ostensible corrections of the hideous text in a script and idiom which somehow seemed
oddly un-human.
These markings were mostly in the respective languages of the various books, all of which
the writer seemed to know with equal though obviously academic facility. One note appended
to von Junzt‘s Unaussprechlichen Kulten, however, was alarmingly otherwise. It consisted of
certain curvilinear hieroglyphs in the same ink as that of the German corrections, but following
no recognised human pattern. And these hieroglyphs were closely and unmistakably akin to
the characters constantly met with in my dreams—characters whose meaning I would
sometimes momentarily fancy I knew or was just on the brink of recalling. To complete my
black confusion, my librarians assured me that, in view of previous examinations and records
of consultation of the volumes in question, all of these notations must have been made by
myself in my secondary state. This despite the fact that I was and still am ignorant of three of
the languages involved.
Piecing together the scattered records, ancient and modern, anthropological and medical, I
found a fairly consistent mixture of myth and hallucination whose scope and wildness left me
utterly dazed. Only one thing consoled me—the fact that the myths were of such early
existence. What lost knowledge could have brought pictures of the Palaeozoic or Mesozoic
landscape into these primitive fables, I could not even guess, but the pictures had been there.
Thus, a basis existed for the formation of a fixed type of delusion. Cases of amnesia no doubt
created the general myth-pattern—but afterward the fanciful accretions of the myths must
have reacted on amnesia sufferers and coloured their pseudo-memories. I myself had read
and heard all the early tales during my memory lapse—my quest had amply proved that. Was
it not natural, then, for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become
coloured and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state? A few
of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the pre-human world,
especially those Hindoo tales involving stupefying gulfs of time and forming part of the lore of
modern theosophists.
Primal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only one—
perhaps the least—of the highly evolved and dominant races of this planet‘s long and largely
unknown career. Things of inconceivable shape, they implied, had reared towers to the sky
and delved into every secret of Nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled
out of the hot sea three hundred million years ago. Some had come down from the stars; a
few were as old as the cosmos itself; others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far
behind the first germs of our life-cycle as those germs are behind ourselves. Spans of
thousands of millions of years, and linkages with other galaxies and universes, were freely
spoken of. Indeed, there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sense.
But most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race, of a queer and
intricate shape resembling no life-form known to science, which had lived till only fifty million
years before the advent of man. This, they indicated, was the greatest race of all; because it
alone had conquered the secret of time. It had learned all things that ever were known or ever
would be known on the earth, through the power of its keener minds to project themselves
into the past and future, even through gulfs of millions of years, and study the lore of every
age. From the accomplishments of this race arose all legends of prophets, including those in
human mythology.
In its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of earth‘s annals—
histories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or that ever would be, with full
records of their arts, their achievements, their languages, and their psychologies. With this
aeon-embracing knowledge, the Great Race chose from every era and life-form such
thoughts, arts, and processes as might suit its own nature and situation. Knowledge of the
past, secured through a kind of mind-casting outside the recognised senses, was harder to
glean than knowledge of the future.
In the latter case the course was easier and more material. With suitable mechanical aid a
mind would project itself forward in time, feeling its dim, extra-sensory way till it approached
the desired period. Then, after preliminary trials, it would seize on the best discoverable
representative of the highest of that period‘s life-forms; entering the organism‘s brain and
setting up therein its own vibrations while the displaced mind would strike back to the period
of the displacer, remaining in the latter‘s body till a reverse process was set up. The projected
mind, in the body of the organism of the future, would then pose as a member of the race
whose outward form it wore; learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the
chosen age and its massed information and techniques.
Meanwhile the displaced mind, thrown back to the displacer‘s age and body, would be
carefully guarded. It would be kept from harming the body it occupied, and would be drained
of all its knowledge by trained questioners. Often it could be questioned in its own language,
when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language. If the mind
came from a body whose language the Great Race could not physically reproduce, clever
machines would be made, on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical
instrument. The Great Race‘s members were immense rugose cones ten feet high, and with
head and other organs attached to foot-thick, distensible limbs spreading from the apexes.
They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of
their four limbs, and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to
their vast ten-foot bases.
When the captive mind‘s amazement and resentment had worn off, and when (assuming that
it came from a body vastly different from the Great Race‘s) it had lost its horror at its
unfamiliar temporary form, it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a
wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer. With suitable precautions, and in
exchange for suitable services, it was allowed to rove all over the habitable world in titan
airships or on the huge boat-like atomic-engined vehicles which traversed the great roads,
and to delve freely into the libraries containing the records of the planet‘s past and future. This
reconciled many captive minds to their lot; since none were other than keen, and to such
minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of earth—closed chapters of inconceivable pasts and
dizzying vortices of future time which include the years ahead of their own natural ages—
forms always, despite the abysmal horrors often unveiled, the supreme experience of life.
Now and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds seized from the
future—to exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a hundred or a thousand or a
million years before or after their own ages. And all were urged to write copiously in their own
languages of themselves and their respective periods; such documents to be filed in the great
central archives.
It may be added that there was one sad special type of captive whose privileges were far
greater than those of the majority. These were the dying permanent exiles, whose bodies in
the future had been seized by keen-minded members of the Great Race who, faced with
death, sought to escape mental extinction. Such melancholy exiles were not as common as
might be expected, since the longevity of the Great Race lessened its love of life—especially
among those superior minds capable of projection. From cases of the permanent projection of
elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later history—
including mankind‘s.
As for the ordinary cases of exploration—when the displacing mind had learned what it
wished in the future, it would build an apparatus like that which had started its flight and
reverse the process of projection. Once more it would be in its own body in its own age, while
the lately captive mind would return to that body of the future to which it properly belonged.
Only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration
impossible. In such cases, of course, the exploring mind had—like those of the death-
escapers—to live out an alien-bodied life in the future; or else the captive mind—like the dying
permanent exiles—had to end its days in the form and past age of the Great Race.
This fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the Great Race—a not
infrequent occurrence, since in all its periods that race was intensely concerned with its own
future. The number of dying permanent exiles of the Great Race was very slight—largely
because of the tremendous penalties attached to displacements of future Great Race minds
by the moribund. Through projection, arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on
the offending minds in their new future bodies—and sometimes forced re-exchanges were
effected. Complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by minds
in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified. In every age since the
discovery of mind-projection, a minute but well-recognised element of the population
consisted of Great Race minds from past ages, sojourning for a longer or shorter while.
When a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future, it was purged
by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the Great Race‘s age—this
because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of
knowledge in large quantities. The few existing instances of clear transmission had caused,
and would cause at known future times, great disasters. And it was largely in consequence of
two cases of the kind (said the old myths) that mankind had learned what it had concerning
the Great Race. Of all things surviving physically and directly from that aeon-distant world,
there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea, and parts of
the text of the frightful Pnakotic Manuscripts.
Thus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most fragmentary
visions of what it had undergone since its seizure. All memories that could be eradicated were
eradicated, so that in most cases only a dream-shadowed blank stretched back to the time of
the first exchange. Some minds recalled more than others, and the chance joining of
memories had at rare times brought hints of the forbidden past to future ages. There probably
never was a time when groups or cults did not secretly cherish certain of these hints. In the
Necronomicon the presence of such a cult among human beings was suggested—a cult that
sometimes gave aid to minds voyaging down the aeons from the days of the Great Race.
And meanwhile the Great Race itself waxed well-nigh omniscient, and turned to the task of
setting up exchanges with the minds of other planets, and of exploring their pasts and futures.
It sought likewise to fathom the past years and origin of that black, aeon-dead orb in far space
whence its own mental heritage had come—for the mind of the Great Race was older than its
bodily form. The beings of a dying elder world, wise with the ultimate secrets, had looked
ahead for a new world and species wherein they might have long life; and had sent their
minds en masse into that future race best adapted to house them—the cone-shaped things
that peopled our earth a billion years ago. Thus the Great Race came to be, while the myriad
minds sent backward were left to die in the horror of strange shapes. Later the race would
again face death, yet would live through another forward migration of its best minds into the
bodies of others who had a longer physical span ahead of them.
Such was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination. When, around 1920, I had
my researches in coherent shape, I felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier
stages had increased. After all, and in spite of the fancies prompted by blind emotions, were
not most of my phenomena readily explainable? Any chance might have turned my mind to
dark studies during the amnesia—and then I read the forbidden legends and met the
members of ancient and ill-regarded cults. That, plainly, supplied the material for the dreams
and disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory. As for the marginal notes in
dream-hieroglyphs and languages unknown to me, but laid at my door by librarians—I might
easily have picked up a smattering of the tongues during my secondary state, while the
hieroglyphs were doubtless coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends, and
afterward woven into my dreams. I tried to verify certain points through conversation with
known cult-leaders, but never succeeded in establishing the right connexions.
At times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to worry me as it
had at first, but on the other hand I reflected that the excitant folklore was undoubtedly more
universal in the past than in the present. Probably all the other victims whose cases were like
mine had had a long and familiar knowledge of the tales I had learned only when in my
secondary state. When these victims had lost their memory, they had associated themselves
with the creatures of their household myths—the fabulous invaders supposed to displace
men‘s minds—and had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge which they thought they
could take back to a fancied, non-human past. Then when their memory returned, they
reversed the associative process and thought of themselves as the former captive minds
instead of as the displacers. Hence the dreams and pseudo-memories following the
conventional myth-pattern.
Despite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations, they came finally to supersede all
others in my mind—largely because of the greater weakness of any rival theory. And a
substantial number of eminent psychologists and anthropologists gradually agreed with me.
The more I reflected, the more convincing did my reasoning seem; till in the end I had a really
effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still assailed me. Suppose I did
see strange things at night? These were only what I had heard and read of. Suppose I did
have odd loathings and perspectives and pseudo-memories? These, too, were only echoes of
myths absorbed in my secondary state. Nothing that I might dream, nothing that I might feel,
could be of any actual significance.
Fortified by this philosophy, I greatly improved in nervous equilibrium, even though the visions
(rather than the abstract impressions) steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly
detailed. In 1922 I felt able to undertake regular work again, and put my newly gained
knowledge to practical use by accepting an instructorship in psychology at the university. My
old chair of political economy had long been adequately filled—besides which, methods of
teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday. My son was at this time just
entering on the post-graduate studies leading to his present professorship, and we worked
together a great deal.
IV.
I continued, however, to keep a careful record of the outré dreams which crowded upon me
so thickly and vividly. Such a record, I argued, was of genuine value as a psychological
document. The glimpses still seemed damnably like memories, though I fought off this
impression with a goodly measure of success. In writing, I treated the phantasmata as things
seen; but at all other times I brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night. I had
never mentioned such matters in common conversation; though reports of them, filtering out
as such things will, had aroused sundry rumours regarding my mental health. It is amusing to
reflect that these rumours were confined wholly to laymen, without a single champion among
physicians or psychologists.
Of my visions after 1914 I will here mention only a few, since fuller accounts and records are
at the disposal of the serious student. It is evident that with time the curious inhibitions
somewhat waned, for the scope of my visions vastly increased. They have never, though,
become other than disjointed fragments seemingly without clear motivation. Within the
dreams I seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom of wandering. I floated
through many strange buildings of stone, going from one to the other along mammoth
underground passages which seemed to form the common avenues of transit. Sometimes I
encountered those gigantic sealed trap-doors in the lowest level, around which such an aura
of fear and forbiddenness clung. I saw tremendous tessellated pools, and rooms of curious
and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts. Then there were colossal caverns of intricate
machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me, and whose sound
manifested itself only after many years of dreaming. I may here remark that sight and sound
are the only senses I have ever exercised in the visionary world.
The real horror began in May, 1915, when I first saw the living things. This was before my
studies had taught me what, in view of the myths and case histories, to expect. As mental
barriers wore down, I beheld great masses of thin vapour in various parts of the building and
in the streets below. These steadily grew more solid and distinct, till at last I could trace their
monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease. They seemed to be enormous iridescent cones,
about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base, and made up of some ridgy, scaly, semi-
elastic matter. From their apexes projected four flexible, cylindrical members, each a foot
thick, and of a ridgy substance like that of the cones themselves. These members were
sometimes contracted almost to nothing, and sometimes extended to any distance up to
about ten feet. Terminating two of them were enormous claws or nippers. At the end of a third
were four red, trumpet-like appendages. The fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe
some two feet in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central
circumference. Surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing flower-like
appendages, whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or tentacles. The
great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery, grey substance which moved the
whole entity through expansion and contraction.
Their actions, though harmless, horrified me even more than their appearance—for it is not
wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one has known only human beings to do.
These objects moved intelligently around the great rooms, getting books from the shelves and
taking them to the great tables, or vice versa, and sometimes writing diligently with a peculiar
rod gripped in the greenish head-tentacles. The huge nippers were used in carrying books
and in conversation—speech consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping. The objects had no
clothing, but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk. They
commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top, although
it was frequently raised or lowered. The other three great members tended to rest downward
on the sides of the cone, contracted to about five feet each, when not in use. From their rate
of reading, writing, and operating their machines (those on the tables seemed somehow
connected with thought) I concluded that their intelligence was enormously greater than
man‘s.
Afterward I saw them everywhere; swarming in all the great chambers and corridors, tending
monstrous machines in vaulted crypts, and racing along the vast roads in gigantic boat-
shaped cars. I ceased to be afraid of them, for they seemed to form supremely natural parts
of their environment. Individual differences amongst them began to be manifest, and a few
appeared to be under some kind of restraint. These latter, though shewing no physical
variation, had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the
majority, but very largely from one another. They wrote a great deal in what seemed to my
cloudy vision a vast variety of characters—never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the
majority. A few, I fancied, used our own familiar alphabet. Most of them worked much more
slowly than the general mass of the entities.
All this time my own part in the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied consciousness
with a range of vision wider than the normal; floating freely about, yet confined to the ordinary
avenues and speeds of travel. Not until August, 1915, did any suggestions of bodily existence
begin to harass me. I say harass, because the first phase was a purely abstract though
infinitely terrible association of my previously noted body-loathing with the scenes of my
visions. For a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself, and
I recall how grateful I was for the total absence of large mirrors in the strange rooms. I was
mightily troubled by the fact that I always saw the great tables—whose height could not be
under ten feet—from a level not below that of their surfaces.
And then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater, till one
night I could not resist it. At first my downward glance revealed nothing whatever. A moment
later I perceived that this was because my head lay at the end of a flexible neck of enormous
length. Retracting this neck and gazing down very sharply, I saw the scaly, rugose, iridescent
bulk of a vast cone ten feet tall and ten feet wide at the base. That was when I waked half of
Arkham with my screaming as I plunged madly up from the abyss of sleep.
Only after weeks of hideous repetition did I grow half-reconciled to these visions of myself in
monstrous form. In the dreams I now moved bodily among the other unknown entities,
reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing for hours at the great tables with a
stylus managed by the green tentacles that hung down from my head. Snatches of what I
read and wrote would linger in my memory. There were horrible annals of other worlds and
other universes, and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes. There were records of
strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts, and frightful
chronicles of grotesque-bodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the
death of the last human being. And I learned of chapters in human history whose existence no
scholar of today has ever suspected. Most of these writings were in the language of the
hieroglyphs; which I studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines, and which was
evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in human
languages. Other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way. A
very few were in languages I knew. Extremely clever pictures, both inserted in the records
and forming separate collections, aided me immensely. And all the time I seemed to be setting
down a history of my own age in English. On waking, I could recall only minute and
meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues which my dream-self had mastered, though
whole phrases of the history stayed with me.
I learned—even before my waking self had studied the parallel cases or the old myths from
which the dreams doubtless sprang—that the entities around me were of the world‘s greatest
race, which had conquered time and had sent exploring minds into every age. I knew, too,
that I had been snatched from my age while another used my body in that age, and that a few
of the other strange forms housed similarly captured minds. I seemed to talk, in some odd
language of claw-clickings, with exiled intellects from every corner of the solar system.
There was a mind from the planet we know as Venus, which would live incalculable epochs to
come, and one from an outer moon of Jupiter six million years in the past. Of earthly minds
there were some from the winged, star-headed, half-vegetable race of palaeogean Antarctica;
one from the reptile people of fabled Valusia; three from the furry pre-human Hyperborean
worshippers of Tsathoggua; one from the wholly abominable Tcho-Tchos; two from the
arachnid denizens of earth‘s last age; five from the hardy coleopterous species immediately
following mankind, to which the Great Race was some day to transfer its keenest minds en
masse in the face of horrible peril; and several from different branches of humanity.
I talked with the mind of Yiang-Li, a philosopher from the cruel empire of Tsan-Chan, which is
to come in A.D. 5000; with that of a general of the great-headed brown people who held
South Africa in B.C. 50,000; with that of a twelfth-century Florentine monk named Bartolomeo
Corsi; with that of a king of Lomar who had ruled that terrible polar land 100,000 years before
the squat, yellow Inutos came from the west to engulf it; with that of Nug-Soth, a magician of
the dark conquerors of A.D. 16,000; with that of a Roman named Titus Sempronius Blaesus,
who had been a quaestor in Sulla‘s time; with that of Khephnes, an Egyptian of the 14th
Dynasty who told me the hideous secret of Nyarlathotep; with that of a priest of Atlantis‘
middle kingdom; with that of a Suffolk gentleman of Cromwell‘s day, James Woodville; with
that of a court astronomer of pre-Inca Peru; with that of the Australian physicist Nevil
Kingston-Brown, who will die in A.D. 2518; with that of an archimage of vanished Yhe in the
Pacific; with that of Theodotides, a Graeco-Bactrian official of B.C. 200; with that of an aged
Frenchman of Louis XIII‘s time named Pierre-Louis Montmagny; with that of Crom-Ya, a
Cimmerian chieftain of B.C. 15,000; and with so many others that my brain cannot hold the
shocking secrets and dizzying marvels I learned from them.
I awaked each morning in a fever, sometimes frantically trying to verify or discredit such
information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge. Traditional facts took on
new and doubtful aspects, and I marvelled at the dream-fancy which could invent such
surprising addenda to history and science. I shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal,
and trembled at the menaces the future may bring forth. What was hinted in the speech of
post-human entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that I will not set it
down here. After man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation, the bodies of whose
members the cream of the Great Race would seize when the monstrous doom overtook the
elder world. Later, as the earth‘s span closed, the transferred minds would again migrate
through time and space—to another stopping-place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable
entities of Mercury. But there would be races after them, clinging pathetically to the cold
planet and burrowing to its horror-filled core, before the utter end.
Meanwhile, in my dreams, I wrote endlessly in that history of my own age which I was
preparing—half voluntarily and half through promises of increased library and travel
opportunities—for the Great Race‘s central archives. The archives were in a colossal
subterranean structure near the city‘s centre, which I came to know well through frequent
labours and consultations. Meant to last as long as the race, and to withstand the fiercest of
earth‘s convulsions, this titan repository surpassed all other buildings in the massive,
mountain-like firmness of its construction.
The records, written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose fabric, were
bound into books that opened from the top, and were kept in individual cases of a strange,
extremely light rustless metal of greyish hue, decorated with mathematical designs and
bearing the title in the Great Race‘s curvilinear hieroglyphs. These cases were stored in tiers
of rectangular vaults—like closed, locked shelves—wrought of the same rustless metal and
fastened by knobs with intricate turnings. My own history was assigned a specific place in the
vaults of the lowest or vertebrate level—the section devoted to the culture of mankind and of
the furry and reptilian races immediately preceding it in terrestrial dominance.
But none of the dreams ever gave me a full picture of daily life. All were the merest misty,
disconnected fragments, and it is certain that these fragments were not unfolded in their
rightful sequence. I have, for example, a very imperfect idea of my own living arrangements in
the dream-world; though I seem to have possessed a great stone room of my own. My
restrictions as a prisoner gradually disappeared, so that some of the visions included vivid
travels over the mighty jungle roads, sojourns in strange cities, and explorations of some of
the vast dark windowless ruins from which the Great Race shrank in curious fear. There were
also long sea-voyages in enormous, many-decked boats of incredible swiftness, and trips
over wild regions in closed, projectile-like airships lifted and moved by electrical repulsion.
Beyond the wide, warm ocean were other cities of the Great Race, and on one far continent I
saw the crude villages of the black-snouted, winged creatures who would evolve as a
dominant stock after the Great Race had sent its foremost minds into the future to escape the
creeping horror. Flatness and exuberant green life were always the keynote of the scene. Hills
were low and sparse, and usually displayed signs of volcanic forces.
Of the animals I saw, I could write volumes. All were wild; for the Great Race‘s mechanised
culture had long since done away with domestic beasts, while food was wholly vegetable or
synthetic. Clumsy reptiles of great bulk floundered in steaming morasses, fluttered in the
heavy air, or spouted in the seas and lakes; and among these I fancied I could vaguely
recognise lesser, archaic prototypes of many forms—dinosaurs, pterodactyls, ichthyosaurs,
labyrinthodonts, rhamphorhynci, plesiosaurs, and the like—made familiar through
palaeontology. Of birds or mammals there were none that I could discern.
The ground and swamps were constantly alive with snakes, lizards, and crocodiles, while
insects buzzed incessantly amidst the lush vegetation. And far out at sea unspied and
unknown monsters spouted mountainous columns of foam into the vaporous sky. Once I was
taken under the ocean in a gigantic submarine vessel with searchlights, and glimpsed some
living horrors of awesome magnitude. I saw also the ruins of incredible sunken cities, and the
wealth of crinoid, brachiopod, coral, and ichthyic life which everywhere abounded.
Of the physiology, psychology, folkways, and detailed history of the Great Race my visions
preserved but little information, and many of the scattered points I here set down were
gleaned from my study of old legends and other cases rather than from my own dreaming.
For in time, of course, my reading and research caught up with and passed the dreams in
many phases; so that certain dream-fragments were explained in advance, and formed
verifications of what I had learned. This consolingly established my belief that similar reading
and research, accomplished by my secondary self, had formed the source of the whole
terrible fabric of pseudo-memories.
The period of my dreams, apparently, was one somewhat less than 150,000,000 years ago,
when the Palaeozoic age was giving place to the Mesozoic. The bodies occupied by the
Great Race represented no surviving—or even scientifically known—line of terrestrial
evolution, but were of a peculiar, closely homogeneous, and highly specialised organic type
inclining as much to the vegetable as to the animal state. Cell-action was of an unique sort
almost precluding fatigue, and wholly eliminating the need of sleep. Nourishment, assimilated
through the red trumpet-like appendages on one of the great flexible limbs, was always semi-
fluid and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals. The beings had but two
of the senses which we recognise—sight and hearing, the latter accomplished through the
flower-like appendages on the grey stalks above their heads—but of other and
incomprehensible senses (not, however, well utilisable by alien captive minds inhabiting their
bodies) they possessed many. Their three eyes were so situated as to give them a range of
vision wider than the normal. Their blood was a sort of deep-greenish ichor of great thickness.
They had no sex, but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on their bases and
could be developed only under water. Great, shallow tanks were used for the growth of their
young—which were, however, reared only in small numbers on account of the longevity of
individuals; four or five thousand years being the common life span.
Markedly defective individuals were quietly disposed of as soon as their defects were noticed.
Disease and the approach of death were, in the absence of a sense of touch or of physical
pain, recognised by purely visual symptoms. The dead were incinerated with dignified
ceremonies. Once in a while, as before mentioned, a keen mind would escape death by
forward projection in time; but such cases were not numerous. When one did occur, the exiled
mind from the future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar
tenement.
The Great Race seemed to form a single loosely knit nation or league, with major institutions
in common, though there were four definite divisions. The political and economic system of
each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism, with major resources rationally distributed, and
power delegated to a small governing board elected by the votes of all able to pass certain
educational and psychological tests. Family organisation was not overstressed, though ties
among persons of common descent were recognised, and the young were generally reared
by their parents.
Resemblances to human attitudes and institutions were, of course, most marked in those
fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned, or where on the other
hand there was a dominance of the basic, unspecialised urges common to all organic life. A
few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the Great Race probed the future
and copied what it liked. Industry, highly mechanised, demanded but little time from each
citizen; and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various
sorts. The sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development, and art was a vital
part of life, though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian.
Technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive, and to keep
in existence the physical fabric of great cities, imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals
of those primal days.
Crime was surprisingly scanty, and was dealt with through highly efficient policing.
Punishments ranged from privilege-deprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotion-
wrenching, and were never administered without a careful study of the criminal‘s motivations.
Warfare, largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian and
octopodic invaders, or against the winged, star-headed Old Ones who centred in the
Antarctic, was infrequent though infinitely devastating. An enormous army, using camera-like
weapons which produced tremendous electrical effects, was kept on hand for purposes
seldom mentioned, but obviously connected with the ceaseless fear of the dark, windowless
elder ruins and of the great sealed trap-doors in the lowest subterrene levels.
This fear of the basalt ruins and trap-doors was largely a matter of unspoken suggestion—or,
at most, of furtive quasi-whispers. Everything specific which bore on it was significantly
absent from such books as were on the common shelves. It was the one subject lying
altogether under a taboo among the Great Race, and seemed to be connected alike with
horrible bygone struggles, and with that future peril which would some day force the race to
send its keener minds ahead en masse in time. Imperfect and fragmentary as were the other
things presented by dreams and legends, this matter was still more bafflingly shrouded. The
vague old myths avoided it—or perhaps all allusions had for some reason been excised. And
in the dreams of myself and others, the hints were peculiarly few. Members of the Great Race
never intentionally referred to the matter, and what could be gleaned came only from some of
the more sharply observant captive minds.
According to these scraps of information, the basis of the fear was a horrible elder race of
half-polypous, utterly alien entities which had come through space from immeasurably distant
universes and had dominated the earth and three other solar planets about six hundred
million years ago. They were only partly material—as we understand matter—and their type of
consciousness and media of perception differed wholly from those of terrestrial organisms.
For example, their senses did not include that of sight; their mental world being a strange,
non-visual pattern of impressions. They were, however, sufficiently material to use
implements of normal matter when in cosmic areas containing it; and they required housing—
albeit of a peculiar kind. Though their senses could penetrate all material barriers, their
substance could not; and certain forms of electrical energy could wholly destroy them. They
had the power of aërial motion despite the absence of wings or any other visible means of
levitation. Their minds were of such texture that no exchange with them could be effected by
the Great Race.
When these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless
towers, and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found. Thus it was when the minds of
the Great Race sped across the void from that obscure trans-galactic world known in the
disturbing and debatable Eltdown Shards as Yith. The newcomers, with the instruments they
created, had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those
caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit.
Then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate, afterward occupying most of
their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with
superstition than with indifference, boldness, or scientific and historical zeal.
But as the aeons passed, there came vague, evil signs that the Elder Things were growing
strong and numerous in the inner world. There were sporadic irruptions of a particularly
hideous character in certain small and remote cities of the Great Race, and in some of the
deserted elder cities which the Great Race had not peopled—places where the paths to the
gulfs below had not been properly sealed or guarded. After that greater precautions were
taken, and many of the paths were closed for ever—though a few were left with sealed trap-
doors for strategic use in fighting the Elder Things if ever they broke forth in unexpected
places; fresh rifts caused by that selfsame geologic change which had choked some of the
paths and had slowly lessened the number of outer-world structures and ruins surviving from
the conquered entities.
The irruptions of the Elder Things must have been shocking beyond all description, since they
had permanently coloured the psychology of the Great Race. Such was the fixed mood of
horror that the very aspect of the creatures was left unmentioned—at no time was I able to
gain a clear hint of what they looked like. There were veiled suggestions of a monstrous
plasticity, and of temporary lapses of visibility, while other fragmentary whispers referred to
their control and military use of great winds. Singular whistling noises, and colossal footprints
made up of five circular toe-marks, seemed also to be associated with them.
It was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the Great Race—the doom that
was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of time to strange bodies in the
safer future—had to do with a final successful irruption of the Elder Beings. Mental projections
down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror, and the Great Race had resolved that none
who could escape should face it. That the foray would be a matter of vengeance, rather than
an attempt to reoccupy the outer world, they knew from the planet‘s later history—for their
projections shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous
entities. Perhaps these entities had come to prefer earth‘s inner abysses to the variable,
storm-ravaged surface, since light meant nothing to them. Perhaps, too, they were slowly
weakening with the aeons. Indeed, it was known that they would be quite dead in the time of
the post-human beetle race which the fleeing minds would tenant. Meanwhile the Great Race
maintained its cautious vigilance, with potent weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified
banishing of the subject from common speech and visible records. And always the shadow of
nameless fear hung about the sealed trap-doors and the dark, windowless elder towers.
V.
That is the world of which my dreams brought me dim, scattered echoes every night. I cannot
hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in such echoes, for it was upon a
wholly intangible quality—the sharp sense of pseudo-memory—that such feelings mainly
depended. As I have said, my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings, in
the form of rational psychological explanations; and this saving influence was augmented by
the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage of time. Yet in spite of
everything the vague, creeping terror would return momentarily now and then. It did not,
however, engulf me as it had before; and after 1922 I lived a very normal life of work and
recreation.
In the course of years I began to feel that my experience—together with the kindred cases
and the related folklore—ought to be definitely summarised and published for the benefit of
serious students; hence I prepared a series of articles briefly covering the whole ground and
illustrated with crude sketches of some of the shapes, scenes, decorative motifs, and
hieroglyphs remembered from the dreams. These appeared at various times during 1928 and
1929 in the Journal of the American Psychological Society, but did not attract much attention.
Meanwhile I continued to record my dreams with the minutest care, even though the growing
stack of reports attained troublesomely vast proportions.
On July 10, 1934, there was forwarded to me by the Psychological Society the letter which
opened the culminating and most horrible phase of the whole mad ordeal. It was postmarked
Pilbarra, Western Australia, and bore the signature of one whom I found, upon inquiry, to be a
mining engineer of considerable prominence. Enclosed were some very curious snapshots. I
will reproduce the text in its entirety, and no reader can fail to understand how tremendous an
effect it and the photographs had upon me.
I was, for a time, almost stunned and incredulous; for although I had often thought that some
basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which had coloured my dreams, I
was none the less unprepared for anything like a tangible survival from a lost world remote
beyond all imagination. Most devastating of all were the photographs—for here, in cold,
incontrovertible realism, there stood out against a background of sand certain worn-down,
water-ridged, storm-weathered blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly
concave bottoms told their own story. And when I studied them with a magnifying glass I could
see all too plainly, amidst the batterings and pittings, the traces of those vast curvilinear
designs and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me. But
here is the letter, which speaks for itself:
49, Dampier Str.,
Pilbarra, W. Australia,
18 May, 1934.
Prof. N. W. Peaslee,
c/o Am. Psychological Society,
30, E. 41st Str.,
N. Y. City, U.S.A.
My dear Sir:—
A recent conversation with Dr. E. M. Boyle of Perth, and some papers with your
articles which he has just sent me, make it advisable for me to tell you about
certain things I have seen in the Great Sandy Desert east of our gold field here. It
would seem, in view of the peculiar legends about old cities with huge stonework
and strange designs and hieroglyphs which you describe, that I have come upon
something very important.
The blackfellows have always been full of talk about ―great stones with marks on
them‖, and seem to have a terrible fear of such things. They connect them in some
way with their common racial legends about Buddai, the gigantic old man who lies
asleep for ages underground with his head on his arm, and who will some day
awake and eat up the world. There are some very old and half-forgotten tales of
enormous underground huts of great stones, where passages lead down and
down, and where horrible things have happened. The blackfellows claim that once
some warriors, fleeing in battle, went down into one and never came back, but that
frightful winds began to blow from the place soon after they went down. However,
there usually isn‘t much in what these natives say.
But what I have to tell is more than this. Two years ago, when I was prospecting
about 500 miles east in the desert, I came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed
stone perhaps 3 × 2 × 2 feet in size, and weathered and pitted to the very limit. At
first I couldn‘t find any of the marks the blackfellows told about, but when I looked
close enough I could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the weathering.
They were peculiar curves, just like what the blacks had tried to describe. I imagine
there must have been 30 or 40 blocks, some nearly buried in the sand, and all
within a circle perhaps a quarter of a mile‘s diameter.
When I saw some, I looked around closely for more, and made a careful reckoning
of the place with my instruments. I also took pictures of 10 or 12 of the most typical
blocks, and will enclose the prints for you to see. I turned my information and
pictures over to the government at Perth, but they have done nothing with them.
Then I met Dr. Boyle, who had read your articles in the Journal of the American
Psychological Society, and in time happened to mention the stones. He was
enormously interested, and became quite excited when I shewed him my
snapshots, saying that the stones and markings were just like those of the masonry
you had dreamed about and seen described in legends. He meant to write you, but
was delayed. Meanwhile he sent me most of the magazines with your articles, and
I saw at once from your drawings and descriptions that my stones are certainly the
kind you mean. You can appreciate this from the enclosed prints. Later on you will
hear directly from Dr. Boyle.
Now I can understand how important all this will be to you. Without question we are
faced with the remains of an unknown civilisation older than any dreamed of
before, and forming a basis for your legends. As a mining engineer, I have some
knowledge of geology, and can tell you that these blocks are so ancient they
frighten me. They are mostly sandstone and granite, though one is almost certainly
made of a queer sort of cement or concrete. They bear evidence of water action,
as if this part of the world had been submerged and come up again after long
ages—all since these blocks were made and used. It is a matter of hundreds of
thousands of years—or heaven knows how much more. I don‘t like to think about it.
In view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and everything
connected with them, I cannot doubt but that you will want to lead an expedition to
the desert and make some archaeological excavations. Both Dr. Boyle and I are
prepared to coöperate in such work if you—or organisations known to you—can
furnish the funds. I can get together a dozen miners for the heavy digging—the
blacks would be of no use, for I‘ve found that they have an almost maniacal fear of
this particular spot. Boyle and I are saying nothing to others, for you very obviously
ought to have precedence in any discoveries or credit.
The place can be reached from Pilbarra in about 4 days by motor tractor—which
we‘d need for our apparatus. It is somewhat west and south of Warburton‘s path of
1873, and 100 miles southeast of Joanna Spring. We could float things up the De
Grey River instead of starting from Pilbarra—but all that can be talked over later.
Roughly, the stones lie at a point about 22° 3' 14" South Latitude, 125° 0' 39" East
Longitude. The climate is tropical, and the desert conditions are trying. Any
expedition had better be made in winter—June or July or August. I shall welcome
further correspondence upon this subject, and am keenly eager to assist in any
plan you may devise. After studying your articles I am deeply impressed with the
profound significance of the whole matter. Dr. Boyle will write later. When rapid
communication is needed, a cable to Perth can be relayed by wireless.
Hoping profoundly for an early message,
Believe me,
Most faithfully yours,
Robert B. F. Mackenzie.
Of the immediate aftermath of this letter, much can be learned from the press. My good
fortune in securing the backing of Miskatonic University was great, and both Mr. Mackenzie
and Dr. Boyle proved invaluable in arranging matters at the Australian end. We were not too
specific with the public about our objects, since the whole matter would have lent itself
unpleasantly to sensational and jocose treatment by the cheaper newspapers. As a result,
printed reports were sparing; but enough appeared to tell of our quest for reported Australian
ruins and to chronicle our various preparatory steps.
Professors William Dyer of the college‘s geology department (leader of the Miskatonic
Antarctic Expedition of 1930–31), Ferdinand C. Ashley of the department of ancient history,
and Tyler M. Freeborn of the department of anthropology—together with my son Wingate—
accompanied me. My correspondent Mackenzie came to Arkham early in 1935 and assisted
in our final preparations. He proved to be a tremendously competent and affable man of about
fifty, admirably well-read, and deeply familiar with all the conditions of Australian travel. He
had tractors waiting at Pilbarra, and we chartered a tramp steamer of sufficiently light draught
to get up the river to that point. We were prepared to excavate in the most careful and
scientific fashion, sifting every particle of sand, and disturbing nothing which might seem to be
in or near its original situation.
Sailing from Boston aboard the wheezy Lexington on March 28, 1935, we had a leisurely trip
across the Atlantic and Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, down the Red Sea, and
across the Indian Ocean to our goal. I need not tell how the sight of the low, sandy West
Australian coast depressed me, and how I detested the crude mining town and dreary gold
fields where the tractors were given their last loads. Dr. Boyle, who met us, proved to be
elderly, pleasant, and intelligent—and his knowledge of psychology led him into many long
discussions with my son and me.
Discomfort and expectancy were oddly mingled in most of us when at length our party of
eighteen rattled forth over the arid leagues of sand and rock. On Friday, May 31st, we forded
a branch of the De Grey and entered the realm of utter desolation. A certain positive terror
grew on me as we advanced to this actual site of the elder world behind the legends—a terror
of course abetted by the fact that my disturbing dreams and pseudo-memories still beset me
with unabated force.
It was on Monday, June 3, that we saw the first of the half-buried blocks. I cannot describe the
emotions with which I actually touched—in objective reality—a fragment of Cyclopean
masonry in every respect like the blocks in the walls of my dream-buildings. There was a
distinct trace of carving—and my hands trembled as I recognised part of a curvilinear
decorative scheme made hellish to me through years of tormenting nightmare and baffling
research.
A month of digging brought a total of some 1250 blocks in varying stages of wear and
disintegration. Most of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and bottoms. A minority
were smaller, flatter, plain-surfaced, and square or octagonally cut—like those of the floors
and pavements in my dreams—while a few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in
such a manner as to suggest use in vaulting or groining, or as parts of arches or round
window casings. The deeper—and the farther north and east—we dug, the more blocks we
found; though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them. Professor
Dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments, and Freeborn found traces of
symbols which fitted darkly into certain Papuan and Polynesian legends of infinite antiquity.
The condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and
geologic upheavals of cosmic savagery.
We had an aëroplane with us, and my son Wingate would often go up to different heights and
scan the sand-and-rock waste for signs of dim, large-scale outlines—either differences of
level or trails of scattered blocks. His results were virtually negative; for whenever he would
one day think he had glimpsed some significant trend, he would on his next trip find the
impression replaced by another equally insubstantial—a result of the shifting, wind-blown
sand. One or two of these ephemeral suggestions, though, affected me queerly and
disagreeably. They seemed, after a fashion, to dovetail horribly with something which I had
dreamed or read, but which I could no longer remember. There was a terrible pseudo-
familiarity about them—which somehow made me look furtively and apprehensively over the
abominable, sterile terrain toward the north and northeast.
Around the first week in July I developed an unaccountable set of mixed emotions about that
general northeasterly region. There was horror, and there was curiosity—but more than that,
there was a persistent and perplexing illusion of memory. I tried all sorts of psychological
expedients to get these notions out of my head, but met with no success. Sleeplessness also
gained upon me, but I almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my
dream-periods. I acquired the habit of taking long, lone walks in the desert late at night—
usually to the north or northeast, whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed subtly
to pull me.
Sometimes, on these walks, I would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the ancient
masonry. Though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we had started, I felt sure
that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface. The ground was less level than at
our camp, and the prevailing high winds now and then piled the sand into fantastic temporary
hillocks—exposing some traces of the elder stones while it covered other traces. I was
queerly anxious to have the excavations extend to this territory, yet at the same time dreaded
what might be revealed. Obviously, I was getting into a rather bad state—all the worse
because I could not account for it.
An indication of my poor nervous health can be gained from my response to an odd discovery
which I made on one of my nocturnal rambles. It was on the evening of July 11th, when a
gibbous moon flooded the mysterious hillocks with a curious pallor. Wandering somewhat
beyond my usual limits, I came upon a great stone which seemed to differ markedly from any
we had yet encountered. It was almost wholly covered, but I stooped and cleared away the
sand with my hands, later studying the object carefully and supplementing the moonlight with
my electric torch. Unlike the other very large rocks, this one was perfectly square-cut, with no
convex or concave surface. It seemed, too, to be of a dark basaltic substance wholly
dissimilar to the granite and sandstone and occasional concrete of the now familiar
fragments.
Suddenly I rose, turned, and ran for the camp at top speed. It was a wholly unconscious and
irrational flight, and only when I was close to my tent did I fully realise why I had run. Then it
came to me. The queer dark stone was something which I had dreamed and read about, and
which was linked with the uttermost horrors of the aeon-old legendry. It was one of the blocks
of that basaltic elder masonry which the fabled Great Race held in such fear—the tall,
windowless ruins left by those brooding, half-material, alien Things that festered in earth‘s
nether abysses and against whose wind-like, invisible forces the trap-doors were sealed and
the sleepless sentinels posted.
I remained awake all that night, but by dawn realised how silly I had been to let the shadow of
a myth upset me. Instead of being frightened, I should have had a discoverer‘s enthusiasm.
The next forenoon I told the others about my find, and Dyer, Freeborn, Boyle, my son, and I
set out to view the anomalous block. Failure, however, confronted us. I had formed no clear
idea of the stone‘s location, and a late wind had wholly altered the hillocks of shifting sand.
VI.
I come now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrative—all the more difficult because
I cannot be quite certain of its reality. At times I feel uncomfortably sure that I was not
dreaming or deluded; and it is this feeling—in view of the stupendous implications which the
objective truth of my experience would raise—which impels me to make this record. My son—
a trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic knowledge of my whole case—
shall be the primary judge of what I have to tell.
First let me outline the externals of the matter, as those at the camp know them. On the night
of July 17–18, after a windy day, I retired early but could not sleep. Rising shortly before
eleven, and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling regarding the northeastward terrain, I
set out on one of my typical nocturnal walks; seeing and greeting only one person—an
Australian miner named Tupper—as I left our precincts. The moon, slightly past full, shone
from a clear sky and drenched the ancient sands with a white, leprous radiance which
seemed to me somehow infinitely evil. There was no longer any wind, nor did any return for
nearly five hours, as amply attested by Tupper and others who did not sleep through the
night. The Australian last saw me walking rapidly across the pallid, secret-guarding hillocks
toward the northeast.
About 3:30 a.m. a violent wind blew up, waking everyone in camp and felling three of the
tents. The sky was unclouded, and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight. As the
party saw to the tents my absence was noted, but in view of my previous walks this
circumstance gave no one alarm. And yet as many as three men—all Australians—seemed to
feel something sinister in the air. Mackenzie explained to Prof. Freeborn that this was a fear
picked up from blackfellow folklore—the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant
myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky.
Such winds, it is whispered, blow out of the great stone huts under the ground where terrible
things have happened—and are never felt except near places where the big marked stones
are scattered. Close to four the gale subsided as suddenly as it had begun, leaving the sand
hills in new and unfamiliar shapes.
It was just past five, with the bloated, fungoid moon sinking in the west, when I staggered into
camp—hatless, tattered, features scratched and ensanguined, and without my electric torch.
Most of the men had returned to bed, but Prof. Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent.
Seeing my winded and almost frenzied state, he called Dr. Boyle, and the two of them got me
on my cot and made me comfortable. My son, roused by the stir, soon joined them, and they
all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep.
But there was no sleep for me. My psychological state was very extraordinary—different from
anything I had previously suffered. After a time I insisted upon talking—nervously and
elaborately explaining my condition. I told them I had become fatigued, and had lain down in
the sand for a nap. There had, I said, been dreams even more frightful than usual—and when
I was awaked by the sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped. I had fled in
panic, frequently falling over half-buried stones and thus gaining my tattered and bedraggled
aspect. I must have slept long—hence the hours of my absence.
Of anything strange either seen or experienced I hinted absolutely nothing—exercising the
greatest self-control in that respect. But I spoke of a change of mind regarding the whole work
of the expedition, and earnestly urged a halt in all digging toward the northeast. My reasoning
was patently weak—for I mentioned a dearth of blocks, a wish not to offend the superstitious
miners, a possible shortage of funds from the college, and other things either untrue or
irrelevant. Naturally, no one paid the least attention to my new wishes—not even my son,
whose concern for my health was very obvious.
The next day I was up and around the camp, but took no part in the excavations. Seeing that I
could not stop the work, I decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my
nerves, and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to Perth—a thousand miles to the
southwest—as soon as he had surveyed the region I wished let alone. If, I reflected, the thing
I had seen was still visible, I might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of
ridicule. It was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up.
Humouring me, my son made the survey that very afternoon; flying over all the terrain my
walk could possibly have covered. Yet nothing of what I had found remained in sight. It was
the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again—the shifting sand had wiped out every
trace. For an instant I half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark fright—
but now I know that the loss was merciful. I can still believe my whole experience an illusion—
especially if, as I devoutly hope, that hellish abyss is never found.
Wingate took me to Perth July 20, though declining to abandon the expedition and return
home. He stayed with me until the 25th, when the steamer for Liverpool sailed. Now, in the
cabin of the Empress, I am pondering long and frantically on the entire matter, and have
decided that my son at least must be informed. It shall rest with him whether to diffuse the
matter more widely. In order to meet any eventuality I have prepared this summary of my
background—as already known in a scattered way to others—and will now tell as briefly as
possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp that hideous night.
Nerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable, dread-
mingled, pseudo-mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on beneath the evil, burning
moon. Here and there I saw, half-shrouded by the sand, those primal Cyclopean blocks left
from nameless and forgotten aeons. The incalculable age and brooding horror of this
monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before, and I could not keep from thinking of
my maddening dreams, of the frightful legends which lay behind them, and of the present
fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones.
And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous—more and more assailed by
bewildering fancies, compulsions, and pseudo-memories. I thought of some of the possible
contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air, and wondered why they
seemed at once so ominous and so familiar. Something was fumbling and rattling at the latch
of my recollection, while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred.
The night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves
of the sea. I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with fate-bound assurance. My
dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each sand-embedded megalith seemed part
of endless rooms and corridors of pre-human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols
that I knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race. At moments I
fancied I saw those omniscient conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks, and I
feared to look down lest I find myself one with them in aspect. Yet all the while I saw the sand-
covered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the
lamps of luminous crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns and cycads beyond
the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time.
I do not know how long or how far—or indeed, in just what direction—I had walked when I first
spied the heap of blocks bared by the day‘s wind. It was the largest group in one place that I
had so far seen, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded
suddenly away. Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an
unguessed past. I drew close and paused, and cast the added light of my electric torch over
the tumbled pile. A hillock had blown away, leaving a low, irregularly round mass of megaliths
and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from two to eight feet high.
From the very outset I realised that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about these
stones. Not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel, but something in the
sand-worn traces of design arrested me as I scanned them under the mingled beams of the
moon and my torch. Not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had
found. It was something subtler than that. The impression did not come when I looked at one
block alone, but only when I ran my eye over several almost simultaneously. Then, at last, the
truth dawned upon me. The curvilinear patterns on many of these blocks were closely
related—parts of one vast decorative conception. For the first time in this aeon-shaken waste
I had come upon a mass of masonry in its old position—tumbled and fragmentary, it is true,
but none the less existing in a very definite sense.
Mounting at a low place, I clambered laboriously over the heap; here and there clearing away
the sand with my fingers, and constantly striving to interpret varieties of size, shape, and
style, and relationships of design. After a while I could vaguely guess at the nature of the
bygone structure, and at the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the
primal masonry. The perfect identity of the whole with some of my dream-glimpses appalled
and unnerved me. This was once a Cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall, paved with octagonal
blocks and solidly vaulted overhead. There would have been rooms opening off on the right,
and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have wound down to still
lower depths.
I started violently as these conceptions occurred to me, for there was more in them than the
blocks themselves had supplied. How did I know that this level should have been far
underground? How did I know that the plane leading upward should have been behind me?
How did I know that the long subterrene passage to the Square of Pillars ought to lie on the
left one level above me? How did I know that the room of machines, and the rightward-
leading tunnel to the central archives, ought to lie two levels below? How did I know that there
would be one of those horrible, metal-banded trap-doors at the very bottom, four levels down?
Bewildered by this intrusion from the dream-world, I found myself shaking and bathed in a
cold perspiration.
Then, as a last, intolerable touch, I felt that faint, insidious stream of cool air trickling upward
from a depressed place near the centre of the huge heap. Instantly, as once before, my
visions faded, and I saw again only the evil moonlight, the brooding desert, and the spreading
tumulus of palaeogean masonry. Something real and tangible, yet fraught with infinite
suggestions of nighted mystery, now confronted me. For that stream of air could argue but
one thing—a hidden gulf of great size beneath the disordered blocks on the surface.
My first thought was of the sinister blackfellow legends of vast underground huts among the
megaliths where horrors happen and great winds are born. Then thoughts of my own dreams
came back, and I felt dim pseudo-memories tugging at my mind. What manner of place lay
below me? What primal, inconceivable source of age-old myth-cycles and haunting
nightmares might I be on the brink of uncovering? It was only for a moment that I hesitated,
for more than curiosity and scientific zeal was driving me on and working against my growing
fear.
I seemed to move almost automatically, as if in the clutch of some compelling fate. Pocketing
my torch, and struggling with a strength that I had not thought I possessed, I wrenched aside
first one titan fragment of stone and then another, till there welled up a strong draught whose
dampness contrasted oddly with the desert‘s dry air. A black rift began to yawn, and at
length—when I had pushed away every fragment small enough to budge—the leprous
moonlight blazed on an aperture of ample width to admit me.
I drew out my torch and cast a brilliant beam into the opening. Below me was a chaos of
tumbled masonry, sloping roughly down toward the north at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, and evidently the result of some bygone collapse from above. Between its surface
and the ground level was a gulf of impenetrable blackness at whose upper edge were signs of
gigantic, stress-heaved vaulting. At this point, it appeared, the desert‘s sands lay directly upon
a floor of some titan structure of earth‘s youth—how preserved through aeons of geologic
convulsion I could not then and cannot now even attempt to guess.
In retrospect, the barest idea of a sudden, lone descent into such a doubtful abyss—and at a
time when one‘s whereabouts were unknown to any living soul—seems like the utter apex of
insanity. Perhaps it was—yet that night I embarked without hesitancy upon such a descent.
Again there was manifest that lure and driving of fatality which had all along seemed to direct
my course. With torch flashing intermittently to save the battery, I commenced a mad
scramble down the sinister, Cyclopean incline below the opening—sometimes facing forward
as I found good hand and foot holds, and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths
as I clung and fumbled more precariously. In two directions beside me, distant walls of carven,
crumbling masonry loomed dimly under the direct beams of my torch. Ahead, however, was
only unbroken blackness.
I kept no track of time during my downward scramble. So seething with baffling hints and
images was my mind, that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into incalculable distances.
Physical sensation was dead, and even fear remained as a wraith-like, inactive gargoyle
leering impotently at me. Eventually I reached a level floor strown with fallen blocks,
shapeless fragments of stone, and sand and detritus of every kind. On either side—perhaps
thirty feet apart—rose massive walls culminating in huge groinings. That they were carved I
could just discern, but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception. What held me
the most was the vaulting overhead. The beam from my torch could not reach the roof, but
the lower parts of the monstrous arches stood out distinctly. And so perfect was their identity
with what I had seen in countless dreams of the elder world, that I trembled actively for the
first time.
Behind and high above, a faint luminous blur told of the distant moonlit world outside. Some
vague shred of caution warned me that I should not let it out of my sight, lest I have no guide
for my return. I now advanced toward the wall on my left, where the traces of carving were
plainest. The littered floor was nearly as hard to traverse as the downward heap had been,
but I managed to pick my difficult way. At one place I heaved aside some blocks and kicked
away the detritus to see what the pavement was like, and shuddered at the utter, fateful
familiarity of the great octagonal stones whose buckled surface still held roughly together.
Reaching a convenient distance from the wall, I cast the torchlight slowly and carefully over its
worn remnants of carving. Some bygone influx of water seemed to have acted on the
sandstone surface, while there were curious incrustations which I could not explain. In places
the masonry was very loose and distorted, and I wondered how many aeons more this primal,
hidden edifice could keep its remaining traces of form amidst earth‘s heavings.
But it was the carvings themselves that excited me most. Despite their time-crumbled state,
they were relatively easy to trace at close range; and the complete, intimate familiarity of
every detail almost stunned my imagination. That the major attributes of this hoary masonry
should be familiar, was not beyond normal credibility. Powerfully impressing the weavers of
certain myths, they had become embodied in a stream of cryptic lore which, somehow coming
to my notice during the amnesic period, had evoked vivid images in my subconscious mind.
But how could I explain the exact and minute fashion in which each line and spiral of these
strange designs tallied with what I had dreamt for more than a score of years? What obscure,
forgotten iconography could have reproduced each subtle shading and nuance which so
persistently, exactly, and unvaryingly besieged my sleeping vision night after night?
For this was no chance or remote resemblance. Definitely and absolutely, the millennially
ancient, aeon-hidden corridor in which I stood was the original of something I knew in sleep
as intimately as I knew my own house in Crane Street, Arkham. True, my dreams shewed the
place in its undecayed prime; but the identity was no less real on that account. I was wholly
and horribly oriented. The particular structure I was in was known to me. Known, too, was its
place in that terrible elder city of dreams. That I could visit unerringly any point in that
structure or in that city which had escaped the changes and devastations of uncounted ages,
I realised with hideous and instinctive certainty. What in God‘s name could all this mean? How
had I come to know what I knew? And what awful reality could lie behind those antique tales
of the beings who had dwelt in this labyrinth of primordial stone?
Words can convey only fractionally the welter of dread and bewilderment which ate at my
spirit. I knew this place. I knew what lay before me, and what had lain overhead before the
myriad towering stories had fallen to dust and debris and the desert. No need now, I thought
with a shudder, to keep that faint blur of moonlight in view. I was torn betwixt a longing to flee
and a feverish mixture of burning curiosity and driving fatality. What had happened to this
monstrous megalopolis of eld in the millions of years since the time of my dreams? Of the
subterrene mazes which had underlain the city and linked all its titan towers, how much had
still survived the writhings of earth‘s crust?
Had I come upon a whole buried world of unholy archaism? Could I still find the house of the
writing-master, and the tower where S‘gg‘ha, a captive mind from the star-headed vegetable
carnivores of Antarctica, had chiselled certain pictures on the blank spaces of the walls?
Would the passage at the second level down, to the hall of the alien minds, be still unchoked
and traversable? In that hall the captive mind of an incredible entity—a half-plastic denizen of
the hollow interior of an unknown trans-Plutonian planet eighteen million years in the future—
had kept a certain thing which it had modelled from clay.
I shut my eyes and put my hand to my head in a vain, pitiful effort to drive these insane
dream-fragments from my consciousness. Then, for the first time, I felt acutely the coolness,
motion, and dampness of the surrounding air. Shuddering, I realised that a vast chain of
aeon-dead black gulfs must indeed be yawning somewhere beyond and below me. I thought
of the frightful chambers and corridors and inclines as I recalled them from my dreams. Would
the way to the central archives still be open? Again that driving fatality tugged insistently at my
brain as I recalled the awesome records that once lay cased in those rectangular vaults of
rustless metal.
There, said the dreams and legends, had reposed the whole history, past and future, of the
cosmic space-time continuum—written by captive minds from every orb and every age in the
solar system. Madness, of course—but had I not now stumbled into a nighted world as mad
as I? I thought of the locked metal shelves, and of the curious knob-twistings needed to open
each one. My own came vividly into my consciousness. How often had I gone through that
intricate routine of varied turns and pressures in the terrestrial vertebrate section on the
lowest level! Every detail was fresh and familiar. If there were such a vault as I had dreamed
of, I could open it in a moment. It was then that madness took me utterly. An instant later, and
I was leaping and stumbling over the rocky debris toward the well-remembered incline to the
depths below.
VII.
From that point forward my impressions are scarcely to be relied on—indeed, I still possess a
final, desperate hope that they all form parts of some daemoniac dream—or illusion born of
delirium. A fever raged in my brain, and everything came to me through a kind of haze—
sometimes only intermittently. The rays of my torch shot feebly into the engulfing blackness,
bringing phantasmal flashes of hideously familiar walls and carvings, all blighted with the
decay of ages. In one place a tremendous mass of vaulting had fallen, so that I had to
clamber over a mighty mound of stones reaching almost to the ragged, grotesquely stalactited
roof. It was all the ultimate apex of nightmare, made worse by the blasphemous tug of
pseudo-memory. One thing only was unfamiliar, and that was my own size in relation to the
monstrous masonry. I felt oppressed by a sense of unwonted smallness, as if the sight of
these towering walls from a mere human body was something wholly new and abnormal.
Again and again I looked nervously down at myself, vaguely disturbed by the human form I
possessed.
Onward through the blackness of the abyss I leaped, plunged, and staggered—often falling
and bruising myself, and once nearly shattering my torch. Every stone and corner of that
daemoniac gulf was known to me, and at many points I stopped to cast beams of light
through choked and crumbling yet familiar archways. Some rooms had totally collapsed;
others were bare or debris-filled. In a few I saw masses of metal—some fairly intact, some
broken, and some crushed or battered—which I recognised as the colossal pedestals or
tables of my dreams. What they could in truth have been, I dared not guess.
I found the downward incline and began its descent—though after a time halted by a gaping,
ragged chasm whose narrowest point could not be much less than four feet across. Here the
stonework had fallen through, revealing incalculable inky depths beneath. I knew there were
two more cellar levels in this titan edifice, and trembled with fresh panic as I recalled the
metal-clamped trap-door on the lowest one. There could be no guards now—for what had
lurked beneath had long since done its hideous work and sunk into its long decline. By the
time of the post-human beetle race it would be quite dead. And yet, as I thought of the native
legends, I trembled anew.
It cost me a terrible effort to vault that yawning chasm, since the littered floor prevented a
running start—but madness drove me on. I chose a place close to the left-hand wall—where
the rift was least wide and the landing-spot reasonably clear of dangerous debris—and after
one frantic moment reached the other side in safety. At last gaining the lower level, I stumbled
on past the archway of the room of machines, within which were fantastic ruins of metal half-
buried beneath fallen vaulting. Everything was where I knew it would be, and I climbed
confidently over the heaps which barred the entrance of a vast transverse corridor. This, I
realised, would take me under the city to the central archives.
Endless ages seemed to unroll as I stumbled, leaped, and crawled along that debris-cluttered
corridor. Now and then I could make out carvings on the age-stained walls—some familiar,
others seemingly added since the period of my dreams. Since this was a subterrene house-
connecting highway, there were no archways save when the route led through the lower
levels of various buildings. At some of these intersections I turned aside long enough to look
down well-remembered corridors and into well-remembered rooms. Twice only did I find any
radical changes from what I had dreamed of—and in one of these cases I could trace the
sealed-up outlines of the archway I remembered.
I shook violently, and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness, as I steered a hurried and
reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless ruined towers whose
alien basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible origin. This primal vault was round
and fully two hundred feet across, with nothing carved upon the dark-hued stonework. The
floor was here free from anything save dust and sand, and I could see the apertures leading
upward and downward. There were no stairs or inclines—indeed, my dreams had pictured
those elder towers as wholly untouched by the fabulous Great Race. Those who had built
them had not needed stairs or inclines. In the dreams, the downward aperture had been
tightly sealed and nervously guarded. Now it lay open—black and yawning, and giving forth a
current of cool, damp air. Of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below, I would
not permit myself to think.
Later, clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor, I reached a place where
the roof had wholly caved in. The debris rose like a mountain, and I climbed up over it,
passing through a vast empty space where my torchlight could reveal neither walls nor
vaulting. This, I reflected, must be the cellar of the house of the metal-purveyors, fronting on
the third square not far from the archives. What had happened to it I could not conjecture.
I found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stones, but after a short
distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting almost touched the
perilously sagging ceiling. How I managed to wrench and tear aside enough blocks to afford a
passage, and how I dared disturb the tightly packed fragments when the least shift of
equilibrium might have brought down all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to
nothingness, I do not know. It was sheer madness that impelled and guided me—if, indeed,
my whole underground adventure was not—as I hope—a hellish delusion or phase of
dreaming. But I did make—or dream that I made—a passage that I could squirm through. As I
wriggled over the mound of debris—my torch, switched continuously on, thrust deeply within
my mouth—I felt myself torn by the fantastic stalactites of the jagged floor above me.
I was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to form my goal.
Sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier, and picking my way along the
remaining stretch of corridor with hand-held, intermittently flashing torch, I came at last to a
low, circular crypt with arches—still in a marvellous state of preservation—opening off on
every side. The walls, or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight, were densely
hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbols—some added since the period of
my dreams.
This, I realised, was my fated destination, and I turned at once through a familiar archway on
my left. That I could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels, I
had oddly little doubt. This vast, earth-protected pile, housing the annals of all the solar
system, had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself.
Blocks of stupendous size, poised with mathematical genius and bound with cements of
incredible toughness, had combined to form a mass as firm as the planet‘s rocky core. Here,
after ages more prodigious than I could sanely grasp, its buried bulk stood in all its essential
contours; the vast, dust-drifted floors scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominant.
The relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head. All the frantic
eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a kind of febrile speed, and I
literally raced along the low-roofed, monstrously well-remembered aisles beyond the archway.
I was past being astonished by the familiarity of what I saw. On every hand the great
hieroglyphed metal shelf-doors loomed monstrously; some yet in place, others sprung open,
and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological stresses not quite strong enough to
shatter the titan masonry. Here and there a dust-covered heap below a gaping empty shelf
seemed to indicate where cases had been shaken down by earth-tremors. On occasional
pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and sub-classes of volumes.
Once I paused before an open vault where I saw some of the accustomed metal cases still in
position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust. Reaching up, I dislodged one of the thinner
specimens with some difficulty, and rested it on the floor for inspection. It was titled in the
prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs, though something in the arrangement of the characters
seemed subtly unusual. The odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known
to me, and I snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within. The
latter, as expected, was some twenty by fifteen inches in area, and two inches thick; the thin
metal covers opening at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad
cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn
letters of the text—symbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet
known to human scholarship—with a haunting, half-aroused memory. It came to me that this
was the language used by a captive mind I had known slightly in my dreams—a mind from a
large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet
whereof it formed a fragment. At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was
devoted to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets.
As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch was
beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with me. Then, armed
with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles
and corridors—recognising now and then some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the
acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs of aeon-
long death and silence. The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden
dust made me shudder. Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human
feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements. Of the particular goal of my insane racing,
my conscious mind held no hint. There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my
dazed will and buried recollections, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random.
I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths. Floors flashed by me as I
raced, but I did not pause to explore them. In my whirling brain there had begun to beat a
certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison. I wanted to unlock something, and
felt that I knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern
safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had once known and still knew. How any
dream—or scrap of unconsciously absorbed legend—could have taught me a detail so
minute, so intricate, and so complex, I did not attempt to explain to myself. I was beyond all
coherent thought. For was not this whole experience—this shocking familiarity with a set of
unknown ruins, and this monstrously exact identity of everything before me with what only
dreams and scraps of myth could have suggested—a horror beyond all reason? Probably it
was my basic conviction then—as it is now during my saner moments—that I was not awake
at all, and that the entire buried city was a fragment of febrile hallucination.
Eventually I reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline. For some
shadowy reason I tried to soften my steps, even though I lost speed thereby. There was a
space I was afraid to cross on this last, deeply buried floor, and as I drew near it I recalled
what thing in that space I feared. It was merely one of the metal-barred and closely guarded
trap-doors. There would be no guards now, and on that account I trembled and tiptoed as I
had done in passing through that black basalt vault where a similar trap-door had yawned. I
felt a current of cool, damp air, as I had felt there, and wished that my course led in another
direction. Why I had to take the particular course I was taking, I did not know.
When I came to the space I saw that the trap-door yawned widely open. Ahead the shelves
began again, and I glimpsed on the floor before one of them a heap very thinly covered with
dust, where a number of cases had recently fallen. At the same moment a fresh wave of panic
clutched me, though for some time I could not discover why. Heaps of fallen cases were not
uncommon, for all through the aeons this lightless labyrinth had been racked by the heavings
of earth and had echoed at intervals to the deafening clatter of toppling objects. It was only
when I was nearly across the space that I realised why I shook so violently.
Not the heap, but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me. In the light of
my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to be—there were places
where it looked thinner, as if it had been disturbed not many months before. I could not be
sure, for even the apparently thinner places were dusty enough; yet a certain suspicion of
regularity in the fancied unevenness was highly disquieting. When I brought the torchlight
close to one of the queer places I did not like what I saw—for the illusion of regularity became
very great. It was as if there were regular lines of composite impressions—impressions that
went in threes, each slightly over a foot square, and consisting of five nearly circular three-
inch prints, one in advance of the other four.
These possible lines of foot-square impressions appeared to lead in two directions, as if
something had gone somewhere and returned. They were of course very faint, and may have
been illusions or accidents; but there was an element of dim, fumbling terror about the way I
thought they ran. For at one end of them was the heap of cases which must have clattered
down not long before, while at the other end was the ominous trap-door with the cool, damp
wind, yawning unguarded down to abysses past imagination.
VIII.
That my strange sense of compulsion was deep and overwhelming is shewn by its conquest
of my fear. No rational motive could have drawn me on after that hideous suspicion of prints
and the creeping dream-memories it excited. Yet my right hand, even as it shook with fright,
still twitched rhythmically in its eagerness to turn a lock it hoped to find. Before I knew it I was
past the heap of lately fallen cases and running on tiptoe through aisles of utterly unbroken
dust toward a point which I seemed to know morbidly, horribly well. My mind was asking itself
questions whose origin and relevancy I was only beginning to guess. Would the shelf be
reachable by a human body? Could my human hand master all the aeon-remembered
motions of the lock? Would the lock be undamaged and workable? And what would I do—
what dare I do—with what (as I now commenced to realise) I both hoped and feared to find?
Would it prove the awesome, brain-shattering truth of something past normal conception, or
shew only that I was dreaming?
The next I knew I had ceased my tiptoe racing and was standing still, staring at a row of
maddeningly familiar hieroglyphed shelves. They were in a state of almost perfect
preservation, and only three of the doors in this vicinity had sprung open. My feelings toward
these shelves cannot be described—so utter and insistent was the sense of old acquaintance.
I was looking high up, at a row near the top and wholly out of my reach, and wondering how I
could climb to best advantage. An open door four rows from the bottom would help, and the
locks of the closed doors formed possible holds for hands and feet. I would grip the torch
between my teeth as I had in other places where both hands were needed. Above all, I must
make no noise. How to get down what I wished to remove would be difficult, but I could
probably hook its movable fastener in my coat collar and carry it like a knapsack. Again I
wondered whether the lock would be undamaged. That I could repeat each familiar motion I
had not the least doubt. But I hoped the thing would not scrape or creak—and that my hand
could work it properly.
Even as I thought these things I had taken the torch in my mouth and begun to climb. The
projecting locks were poor supports; but as I had expected, the opened shelf helped greatly. I
used both the difficultly swinging door and the edge of the aperture itself in my ascent, and
managed to avoid any loud creaking. Balanced on the upper edge of the door, and leaning far
to my right, I could just reach the lock I sought. My fingers, half-numb from climbing, were
very clumsy at first; but I soon saw that they were anatomically adequate. And the memory-
rhythm was strong in them. Out of unknown gulfs of time the intricate secret motions had
somehow reached my brain correctly in every detail—for after less than five minutes of trying
there came a click whose familiarity was all the more startling because I had not consciously
anticipated it. In another instant the metal door was slowly swinging open with only the
faintest grating sound.
Dazedly I looked over the row of greyish case-ends thus exposed, and felt a tremendous
surge of some wholly inexplicable emotion. Just within reach of my right hand was a case
whose curving hieroglyphs made me shake with a pang infinitely more complex than one of
mere fright. Still shaking, I managed to dislodge it amidst a shower of gritty flakes, and ease it
over toward myself without any violent noise. Like the other case I had handled, it was slightly
more than twenty by fifteen inches in size, with curved mathematical designs in low relief. In
thickness it just exceeded three inches. Crudely wedging it between myself and the surface I
was climbing, I fumbled with the fastener and finally got the hook free. Lifting the cover, I
shifted the heavy object to my back, and let the hook catch hold of my collar. Hands now free,
I awkwardly clambered down to the dusty floor, and prepared to inspect my prize.
Kneeling in the gritty dust, I swung the case around and rested it in front of me. My hands
shook, and I dreaded to draw out the book within almost as much as I longed—and felt
compelled—to do so. It had very gradually become clear to me what I ought to find, and this
realisation nearly paralysed my faculties. If the thing were there—and if I were not dreaming—
the implications would be quite beyond the power of the human spirit to bear. What tormented
me most was my momentary inability to feel that my surroundings were a dream. The sense
of reality was hideous—and again becomes so as I recall the scene.
At length I tremblingly pulled the book from its container and stared fascinatedly at the well-
known hieroglyphs on the cover. It seemed to be in prime condition, and the curvilinear letters
of the title held me in almost as hypnotised a state as if I could read them. Indeed, I cannot
swear that I did not actually read them in some transient and terrible access of abnormal
memory. I do not know how long it was before I dared to lift that thin metal cover. I temporised
and made excuses to myself. I took the torch from my mouth and shut it off to save the
battery. Then, in the dark, I screwed up my courage—finally lifting the cover without turning on
the light. Last of all I did indeed flash the torch upon the exposed page—steeling myself in
advance to suppress any sound no matter what I should find.
I looked for an instant, then almost collapsed. Clenching my teeth, however, I kept silence. I
sank wholly to the floor and put a hand to my forehead amidst the engulfing blackness. What I
dreaded and expected was there. Either I was dreaming, or time and space had become a
mockery. I must be dreaming—but I would test the horror by carrying this thing back and
shewing it to my son if it were indeed a reality. My head swam frightfully, even though there
were no visible objects in the unbroken gloom to swirl around me. Ideas and images of the
starkest terror—excited by vistas which my glimpse had opened up—began to throng in upon
me and cloud my senses.
I thought of those possible prints in the dust, and trembled at the sound of my own breathing
as I did so. Once again I flashed on the light and looked at the page as a serpent‘s victim may
look at his destroyer‘s eyes and fangs. Then, with clumsy fingers in the dark, I closed the
book, put it in its container, and snapped the lid and the curious hooked fastener. This was
what I must carry back to the outer world if it truly existed—if the whole abyss truly existed—if
I, and the world itself, truly existed.
Just when I tottered to my feet and commenced my return I cannot be certain. It comes to me
oddly—as a measure of my sense of separation from the normal world—that I did not even
once look at my watch during those hideous hours underground. Torch in hand, and with the
ominous case under one arm, I eventually found myself tiptoeing in a kind of silent panic past
the draught-giving abyss and those lurking suggestions of prints. I lessened my precautions
as I climbed up the endless inclines, but could not shake off a shadow of apprehension which
I had not felt on the downward journey.
I dreaded having to re-pass through that black basalt crypt that was older than the city itself,
where cold draughts welled up from unguarded depths. I thought of that which the Great Race
had feared, and of what might still be lurking—be it ever so weak and dying—down there. I
thought of those possible five-circle prints and of what my dreams had told me of such
prints—and of strange winds and whistling noises associated with them. And I thought of the
tales of the modern blacks, wherein the horror of great winds and nameless subterrene ruins
was dwelt upon.
I knew from a carven wall symbol the right floor to enter, and came at last—after passing that
other book I had examined—to the great circular space with the branching archways. On my
right, and at once recognisable, was the arch through which I had arrived. This I now entered,
conscious that the rest of my course would be harder because of the tumbled state of the
masonry outside the archive building. My new metal-cased burden weighed upon me, and I
found it harder and harder to be quiet as I stumbled among debris and fragments of every
sort.
Then I came to the ceiling-high mound of debris through which I had wrenched a scanty
passage. My dread at wriggling through again was infinite; for my first passage had made
some noise, and I now—after seeing those possible prints—dreaded sound above all things.
The case, too, doubled the problem of traversing the narrow crevice. But I clambered up the
barrier as best I could, and pushed the case through the aperture ahead of me. Then, torch in
mouth, I scrambled through myself—my back torn as before by stalactites. As I tried to grasp
the case again, it fell some distance ahead of me down the slope of the debris, making a
disturbing clatter and arousing echoes which sent me into a cold perspiration. I lunged for it at
once, and regained it without further noise—but a moment afterward the slipping of blocks
under my feet raised a sudden and unprecedented din.
The din was my undoing. For, falsely or not, I thought I heard it answered in a terrible way
from spaces far behind me. I thought I heard a shrill, whistling sound, like nothing else on
earth, and beyond any adequate verbal description. It may have been only my imagination. If
so, what followed has a grim irony—since, save for the panic of this thing, the second thing
might never have happened.
As it was, my frenzy was absolute and unrelieved. Taking my torch in my hand and clutching
feebly at the case, I leaped and bounded wildly ahead with no idea in my brain beyond a mad
desire to race out of these nightmare ruins to the waking world of desert and moonlight which
lay so far above. I hardly knew it when I reached the mountain of debris which towered into
the vast blackness beyond the caved-in roof, and bruised and cut myself repeatedly in
scrambling up its steep slope of jagged blocks and fragments. Then came the great disaster.
Just as I blindly crossed the summit, unprepared for the sudden dip ahead, my feet slipped
utterly and I found myself involved in a mangling avalanche of sliding masonry whose
cannon-loud uproar split the black cavern air in a deafening series of earth-shaking
reverberations.
I have no recollection of emerging from this chaos, but a momentary fragment of
consciousness shews me as plunging and tripping and scrambling along the corridor amidst
the clangour—case and torch still with me. Then, just as I approached that primal basalt crypt
I had so dreaded, utter madness came. For as the echoes of the avalanche died down, there
became audible a repetition of that frightful, alien whistling I thought I had heard before. This
time there was no doubt about it—and what was worse, it came from a point not behind but
ahead of me.
Probably I shrieked aloud then. I have a dim picture of myself as flying through the hellish
basalt vault of the Elder Things, and hearing that damnable alien sound piping up from the
open, unguarded door of limitless nether blacknesses. There was a wind, too—not merely a
cool, damp draught, but a violent, purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that
abominable gulf whence the obscene whistling came.
There are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort, with that torrent of
wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment, and seeming to curl and twist
purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from the spaces behind and beneath.
Though in my rear, that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding my progress; as
if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me. Heedless of the noise I made, I clattered
over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the structure that led to the surface. I recall
glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as I saw the incline
leading down to where one of those blasphemous trap-doors must be yawning two levels
below. But instead of crying out I muttered over and over to myself that this was all a dream
from which I must soon awake. Perhaps I was in camp—perhaps I was at home in Arkham.
As these hopes bolstered up my sanity I began to mount the incline to the higher level.
I knew, of course, that I had the four-foot cleft to re-cross, yet was too racked by other fears to
realise the full horror until I came almost upon it. On my descent, the leap across had been
easy—but could I clear the gap as readily when going uphill, and hampered by fright,
exhaustion, the weight of the metal case, and the anomalous backward tug of that daemon
wind? I thought of these things at the last moment, and thought also of the nameless entities
which might be lurking in the black abysses below the chasm.
My wavering torch was growing feeble, but I could tell by some obscure memory when I
neared the cleft. The chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling shrieks behind me were
for the moment like a merciful opiate, dulling my imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf
ahead. And then I became aware of the added blasts and whistling in front of me—tides of
abomination surging up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginable.
Now, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed—and ignoring
everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over
the incline‘s debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I saw the chasm‘s edge, leaped frenziedly
with every ounce of strength I possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniac
vortex of loathsome sound and utter, materially tangible blackness.
This is the end of my experience, so far as I can recall. Any further impressions belong wholly
to the domain of phantasmagoric delirium. Dream, madness, and memory merged wildly
together in a series of fantastic, fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything
real. There was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient darkness, and
a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life. Dormant,
rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me, telling of pits and voids peopled by
floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless
basalt towers upon which no light ever shone.
Secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the
aid of sight or sound, and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my
former dreams had ever suggested. And all the while cold fingers of damp vapour clutched
and picked at me, and that eldritch, damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the
alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness around.
Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean city of my dreams—not in ruins, but just as I
had dreamed of it. I was in my conical, non-human body again, and mingled with crowds of
the Great Race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and
vast inclines. Then, superimposed upon these pictures, were frightful momentary flashes of a
non-visual consciousness involving desperate struggles, a writhing free from clutching
tentacles of whistling wind, an insane, bat-like flight through half-solid air, a feverish burrowing
through the cyclone-whipped dark, and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry.
Once there was a curious, intrusive flash of half-sight—a faint, diffuse suspicion of bluish
radiance far overhead. Then there came a dream of wind-pursued climbing and crawling—of
wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and
collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane. It was the evil, monotonous beating of that
maddening moonlight which at last told me of the return of what I had once known as the
objective, waking world.
I was clawing prone through the sands of the Australian desert, and around me shrieked such
a tumult of wind as I had never before known on our planet‘s surface. My clothing was in rags,
and my whole body was a mass of bruises and scratches. Full consciousness returned very
slowly, and at no time could I tell just where true memory left off and delirious dream began.
There had seemed to be a mound of titan blocks, an abyss beneath it, a monstrous revelation
from the past, and a nightmare horror at the end—but how much of this was real? My
flashlight was gone, and likewise any metal case I may have discovered. Had there been
such a case—or any abyss—or any mound? Raising my head, I looked behind me, and saw
only the sterile, undulant sands of the waste.
The daemon wind died down, and the bloated, fungoid moon sank reddeningly in the west. I
lurched to my feet and began to stagger southwestward toward the camp. What in truth had
happened to me? Had I merely collapsed in the desert and dragged a dream-racked body
over miles of sand and buried blocks? If not, how could I bear to live any longer? For in this
new doubt all my faith in the myth-born unreality of my visions dissolved once more into the
hellish older doubting. If that abyss was real, then the Great Race was real—and its
blasphemous reachings and seizures in the cosmos-wide vortex of time were no myths or
nightmares, but a terrible, soul-shattering actuality.
Had I, in full hideous fact, been drawn back to a pre-human world of a hundred and fifty
million years ago in those dark, baffling days of the amnesia? Had my present body been the
vehicle of a frightful alien consciousness from palaeogean gulfs of time? Had I, as the captive
mind of those shambling horrors, indeed known that accursed city of stone in its primordial
heyday, and wriggled down those familiar corridors in the loathsome shape of my captor?
Were those tormenting dreams of more than twenty years the offspring of stark, monstrous
memories? Had I once veritably talked with minds from reachless corners of time and space,
learned the universe‘s secrets past and to come, and written the annals of my own world for
the metal cases of those titan archives? And were those others—those shocking Elder Things
of the mad winds and daemon pipings—in truth a lingering, lurking menace, waiting and
slowly weakening in black abysses while varied shapes of life drag out their multimillennial
courses on the planet‘s age-racked surface?
I do not know. If that abyss and what it held were real, there is no hope. Then, all too truly,
there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out of time. But mercifully,
there is no proof that these things are other than fresh phases of my myth-born dreams. I did
not bring back the metal case that would have been a proof, and so far those subterrene
corridors have not been found. If the laws of the universe are kind, they will never be found.
But I must tell my son what I saw or thought I saw, and let him use his judgment as a
psychologist in gauging the reality of my experience, and communicating this account to
others.
I have said that the awful truth behind my tortured years of dreaming hinges absolutely upon
the actuality of what I thought I saw in those Cyclopean buried ruins. It has been hard for me
literally to set down the crucial revelation, though no reader can have failed to guess it. Of
course it lay in that book within the metal case—the case which I pried out of its forgotten lair
amidst the undisturbed dust of a million centuries. No eye had seen, no hand had touched
that book since the advent of man to this planet. And yet, when I flashed my torch upon it in
that frightful megalithic abyss, I saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle, aeon-
browned cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earth‘s youth. They
were, instead, the letters of our familiar alphabet, spelling out the words of the English
language in my own handwriting.

The Haunter of the Dark
(1935)
(Dedicated to Robert Bloch)
I have seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim—
Where they roll in their horror unheeded,
Without knowledge or lustre or name.
—Nemesis.
Cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that Robert Blake was
killed by lightning, or by some profound nervous shock derived from an electrical discharge. It
is true that the window he faced was unbroken, but Nature has shewn herself capable of
many freakish performances. The expression on his face may easily have arisen from some
obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw, while the entries in his diary are
clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by
certain old matters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church
on Federal Hill—the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry,
conscious or unconscious, with at least some of which Blake was secretly connected.
For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of myth, dream,
terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre, spectral sort.
His earlier stay in the city—a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and
forbidden lore as he—had ended amidst death and flame, and it must have been some
morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in Milwaukee. He may have known of the
old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have nipped
in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection.
Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, there remain
several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories. They are inclined to take much
of Blake‘s diary at its face value, and point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted
genuineness of the old church record, the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox
Starry Wisdom sect prior to 1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter
named Edwin M. Lillibridge in 1893, and—above all—the look of monstrous, transfiguring fear
on the face of the young writer when he died. It was one of these believers who, moved to
fanatical extremes, threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned
metal box found in the old church steeple—the black windowless steeple, and not the tower
where Blake‘s diary said those things originally were. Though widely censured both officially
and unofficially, this man—a reputable physician with a taste for odd folklore—averred that he
had rid the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it.
Between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself. The papers have
given the tangible details from a sceptical angle, leaving for others the drawing of the picture
as Robert Blake saw it—or thought he saw it—or pretended to see it. Now, studying the diary
closely, dispassionately, and at leisure, let us summarise the dark chain of events from the
expressed point of view of their chief actor.
Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934–5, taking the upper floor of a
venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street—on the crest of the great eastward hill
near the Brown University campus and behind the marble John Hay Library. It was a cosy and
fascinating place, in a little garden oasis of village-like antiquity where huge, friendly cats
sunned themselves atop a convenient shed. The square Georgian house had a monitor roof,
classic doorway with fan carving, small-paned windows, and all the other earmarks of early
nineteenth-century workmanship. Inside were six-panelled doors, wide floor-boards, a curving
colonial staircase, white Adam-period mantels, and a rear set of rooms three steps below the
general level.
Blake‘s study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden on one side, while its
west windows—before one of which he had his desk—faced off from the brow of the hill and
commanded a splendid view of the lower town‘s outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets
that flamed behind them. On the far horizon were the open countryside‘s purple slopes.
Against these, some two miles away, rose the spectral hump of Federal Hill, bristling with
huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic
forms as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious sense
that he was looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might or might not vanish in
dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in person.
Having sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique furniture suitable to his
quarters and settled down to write and paint—living alone, and attending to the simple
housework himself. His studio was in a north attic room, where the panes of the monitor roof
furnished admirable lighting. During that first winter he produced five of his best-known short
stories—―The Burrower Beneath‖, ―The Stairs in the Crypt‖, ―Shaggai‖, ―In the Vale of Pnath‖,
and ―The Feaster from the Stars‖—and painted seven canvases; studies of nameless,
unhuman monsters, and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes.
At sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspread west—the dark
towers of Memorial Hall just below, the Georgian court-house belfry, the lofty pinnacles of the
downtown section, and that shimmering, spire-crowned mound in the distance whose
unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy. From his few local
acquaintances he learned that the far-off slope was a vast Italian quarter, though most of the
houses were remnants of older Yankee and Irish days. Now and then he would train his field-
glasses on that spectral, unreachable world beyond the curling smoke; picking out individual
roofs and chimneys and steeples, and speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries
they might house. Even with optical aid Federal Hill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous,
and linked to the unreal, intangible marvels of Blake‘s own tales and pictures. The feeling
would persist long after the hill had faded into the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-
house floodlights and the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the night
grotesque.
Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most fascinated Blake. It
stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower
and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky. It seemed to rest on especially
high ground; for the grimy facade, and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the
tops of great pointed windows, rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and
chimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of stone, stained and
weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more. The style, so far as the glass
could shew, was that earliest experimental form of Gothic revival which preceded the stately
Upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the Georgian age.
Perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815.
As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with an oddly mounting
interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted, he knew that it must be vacant. The
longer he watched, the more his imagination worked, till at length he began to fancy curious
things. He believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered over the place, so that
even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves. Around other towers and belfries
his glass would reveal great flocks of birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what
he thought and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends, but none of
them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed the faintest notion of what the church was
or had been.
In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his long-planned novel—
based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in Maine—but was strangely unable to make
progress with it. More and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant
hill and the black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate leaves came out
on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty, but Blake‘s restlessness was
merely increased. It was then that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up
that fabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream.
Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made his first trip into the
unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak, decayed squares
beyond, he came finally upon the ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric
porches, and blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known, unreachable
world beyond the mists. There were dingy blue-and-white street signs which meant nothing to
him, and presently he noted the strange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign
signs over curious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could he find any
of the objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he half fancied that the Federal Hill of
that distant view was a dream-world never to be trod by living human feet.
Now and then a battered church facade or crumbling spire came in sight, but never the
blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper about a great stone church the
man smiled and shook his head, though he spoke English freely. As Blake climbed higher, the
region seemed stranger and stranger, with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys
leading eternally off to the south. He crossed two or three broad avenues, and once thought
he glimpsed a familiar tower. Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone,
and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man‘s
face had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious sign with his
right hand.
Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left, above the tiers of
brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys. Blake knew at once what it was, and plunged
toward it through the squalid, unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue. Twice he lost his
way, but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their
doorsteps, or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes.
At last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge stone bulk rose darkly at the
end of an alley. Presently he stood in a windswept open square, quaintly cobblestoned, with a
high bank wall on the farther side. This was the end of his quest; for upon the wide, iron-
railed, weed-grown plateau which the wall supported—a separate, lesser world raised fully six
feet above the surrounding streets—there stood a grim, titan bulk whose identity, despite
Blake‘s new perspective, was beyond dispute.
The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high stone buttresses had
fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost among the brown, neglected weeds and
grasses. The sooty Gothic windows were largely unbroken, though many of the stone
mullions were missing. Blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived
so well, in view of the known habits of small boys the world over. The massive doors were
intact and tightly closed. Around the top of the bank wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a
rusty iron fence whose gate—at the head of a flight of steps from the square—was visibly
padlocked. The path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown. Desolation and
decay hung like a pall above the place, and in the birdless eaves and black, ivyless walls
Blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his power to define.
There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at the northerly end
and approached him with questions about the church. He was a great wholesome Irishman,
and it seemed odd that he would do little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter
that people never spoke of that building. When Blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that
the Italian priests warned everybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt
there and left its mark. He himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalled
certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood.
There had been a bad sect there in the ould days—an outlaw sect that called up awful things
from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken a good priest to exorcise what had come,
though there did be those who said that merely the light could do it. If Father O‘Malley were
alive there would be many the thing he could tell. But now there was nothing to do but let it
alone. It hurt nobody now, and those that owned it were dead or far away. They had run away
like rats after the threatening talk in ‘77, when people began to mind the way folks vanished
now and then in the neighbourhood. Some day the city would step in and take the property for
lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody‘s touching it. Better it be left alone for the
years to topple, lest things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyss.
After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile. It excited him to
find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him, and he wondered what grain of
truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated. Probably they were mere
legends evoked by the evil look of the place, but even so, they were like a strange coming to
life of one of his own stories.
The afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed unable to light up the
stained, sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its high plateau. It was odd that the
green of spring had not touched the brown, withered growths in the raised, iron-fenced yard.
Blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining the bank wall and rusted
fence for possible avenues of ingress. There was a terrible lure about the blackened fane
which was not to be resisted. The fence had no opening near the steps, but around on the
north side were some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk around on the narrow
coping outside the fence till he came to the gap. If the people feared the place so wildly, he
would encounter no interference.
He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed him. Then,
looking down, he saw the few people in the square edging away and making the same sign
with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made. Several windows were
slammed down, and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children inside
a rickety, unpainted house. The gap in the fence was very easy to pass through, and before
long Blake found himself wading amidst the rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard.
Here and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in
this field; but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The sheer bulk of the church was
oppressive now that he was close to it, but he conquered his mood and approached to try the
three great doors in the facade. All were securely locked, so he began a circuit of the
Cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening. Even then he could
not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its
strangeness dragged him on automatically.
A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture. Peering
in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western sun‘s filtered
rays. Debris, old barrels, and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye,
though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines. The rusted
remains of a hot-air furnace shewed that the building had been used and kept in shape as
late as mid-Victorian times.
Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window and let himself
down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strown concrete floor. The vaulted cellar was a vast
one, without partitions; and in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black
archway evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually
within the great spectral building, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about—finding
a still-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit.
Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide, cobweb-festooned space toward the arch. Half
choked with the omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres, he reached and
began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness. He had no light, but
groped carefully with his hands. After a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little
fumbling revealed its ancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined
corridor lined with worm-eaten panelling.
Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion. All the inner doors were
unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to room. The colossal nave was an almost
eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box pews, altar, hourglass pulpit, and
sounding-board, and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the
gallery and entwining the clustered Gothic columns. Over all this hushed desolation played a
hideous leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange, half-
blackened panes of the great apsidal windows.
The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake could scarcely decipher
what they had represented, but from the little he could make out he did not like them. The
designs were largely conventional, and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much
concerning some of the ancient patterns. The few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly
open to criticism, while one of the windows seemed to shew merely a dark space with spirals
of curious luminosity scattered about in it. Turning away from the windows, Blake noticed that
the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind, but resembled the
primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt.
In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high shelves of
mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first time he received a positive shock of
objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden
things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive,
timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial
formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man‘s youth, and the
dim, fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of them—a Latin version of
the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous Cultes des Goules of
Comte d‘Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn‘s hellish De
Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he had known merely by reputation or not at all—the
Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume in wholly unidentifiable
characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable to the occult
student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place had once been the seat of
an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe.
In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with entries in some odd
cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols
used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts—the
devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs—here massed in solid pages
of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some
alphabetical letter.
In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket.
Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably, and he felt tempted to
borrow them at some later time. He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so
long. Was he the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years
protected this deserted place from visitors?
Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through the dust of
the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase presumably
leading up to the blackened tower and steeple—objects so long familiar to him at a distance.
The ascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had done their
worst in this constricted place. The staircase was a spiral with high, narrow wooden treads,
and now and then Blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city. Though he
had seen no ropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose
narrow, louver-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied so often. Here he was
doomed to disappointment; for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower
chamber vacant of chimes, and clearly devoted to vastly different purposes.
The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet windows, one on each
side, which were glazed within their screening of decayed louver-boards. These had been
further fitted with tight, opaque screens, but the latter were now largely rotted away. In the
centre of the dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and
two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised, and wholly
unrecognisable hieroglyphs. On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form;
its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the decade-deep dust
to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through. Around the
pillar in a rough circle were seven high-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind
them, ranging along the dark-panelled walls, were seven colossal images of crumbling, black-
painted plaster, resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of
mysterious Easter Island. In one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the
wall, leading up to the closed trap-door of the windowless steeple above.
As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on the strange open
box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and
handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting
entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this
planet. The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron
with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort, or an artificial
object of carved and highly polished mineral matter. It did not touch the bottom of the box, but
was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre, with seven queerly
designed supports extending horizontally to angles of the box‘s inner wall near the top. This
stone, once exposed, exerted upon Blake an almost alarming fascination. He could scarcely
tear his eyes from it, and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was
transparent, with half-formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind floated pictures of alien
orbs with great stone towers, and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life, and still
remoter spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of
consciousness and will.
When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner
near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took his attention he could not tell, but something in
its contours carried a message to his unconscious mind. Ploughing toward it, and brushing
aside the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something grim about it. Hand
and handkerchief soon revealed the truth, and Blake gasped with a baffling mixture of
emotions. It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time. The
clothing was in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man‘s grey suit.
There were other bits of evidence—shoes, metal clasps, huge buttons for round cuffs, a
stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter‘s badge with the name of the old Providence Telegram,
and a crumbling leather pocketbook. Blake examined the latter with care, finding within it
several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the
name ―Edwin M. Lillibridge‖, and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.
This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully at the dim westward
window. Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following:
―Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844—buys old Free-Will Church in
July—his archaeological work & studies in occult well known.‖
―Dr. Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon Dec. 29, 1844.‖
―Congregation 97 by end of ‘45.‖
―1846—3 disappearances—first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.‖
―7 disappearances 1848—stories of blood sacrifice begin.‖
―Investigation 1853 comes to nothing—stories of sounds.‖
―Fr. O‘Malley tells of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian ruins—says
they call up something that can‘t exist in light. Flees a little light, and banished by
strong light. Then has to be summoned again. Probably got this from deathbed
confession of Francis X. Feeney, who had joined Starry Wisdom in ‘49. These
people say the Shining Trapezohedron shews them heaven & other worlds, & that
the Haunter of the Dark tells them secrets in some way.‖
―Story of Orrin B. Eddy 1857. They call it up by gazing at the crystal, & have a
secret language of their own.‖
―200 or more in cong. 1863, exclusive of men at front.‖
―Irish boys mob church in 1869 after Patrick Regan‘s disappearance.‖
―Veiled article in J. March 14, ‘72, but people don‘t talk about it.‖
―6 disappearances 1876—secret committee calls on Mayor Doyle.‖
―Action promised Feb. 1877—church closes in April.‖
―Gang—Federal Hill Boys—threaten Dr. —— and vestrymen in May.‖
―181 persons leave city before end of ‘77—mention no names.‖
―Ghost stories begin around 1880—try to ascertain truth of report that no human
being has entered church since 1877.‖
―Ask Lanigan for photograph of place taken 1851.‖ . . .
Restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his coat, Blake turned to look
down at the skeleton in the dust. The implications of the notes were clear, and there could be
no doubt but that this man had come to the deserted edifice forty-two years before in quest of
a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt. Perhaps no one
else had known of his plan—who could tell? But he had never returned to his paper. Had
some bravely suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heart-failure?
Blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state. Some of them were
badly scattered, and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the ends. Others were strangely
yellowed, with vague suggestions of charring. This charring extended to some of the
fragments of clothing. The skull was in a very peculiar state—stained yellow, and with a
charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone. What
had happened to the skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here Blake could
not imagine.
Before he realised it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its curious influence call
up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw processions of robed, hooded figures whose
outlines were not human, and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-
reaching monoliths. He saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea, and vortices of
space where wisps of black mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze. And
beyond all else he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semi-solid forms
were known only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose
order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we know.
Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminate panic fear.
Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of some formless alien presence
close to him and watching him with horrible intentness. He felt entangled with something—
something which was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at him—something
which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight. Plainly, the
place was getting on his nerves—as well it might in view of his gruesome find. The light was
waning, too, and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leaving
soon.
It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint trace of luminosity in the
crazily angled stone. He had tried to look away from it, but some obscure compulsion drew
his eyes back. Was there a subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing? What
was it that the dead man‘s notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron? What,
anyway, was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil? What had been done here, and what might
still be lurking in the bird-shunned shadows? It seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor
had arisen somewhere close by, though its source was not apparent. Blake seized the cover
of the long-open box and snapped it down. It moved easily on its alien hinges, and closed
completely over the unmistakably glowing stone.
At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeple‘s
eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door. Rats, without question—the only living
things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since he had entered it. And yet that
stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral
stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering dusk of
the deserted square, and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of
Federal Hill toward the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college
district.
During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition. Instead, he read much in
certain books, examined long years of newspaper files downtown, and worked feverishly at
the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room. The cipher, he soon
saw, was no simple one; and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language
could not be English, Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. Evidently he would
have to draw upon the deepest wells of his strange erudition.
Every evening the old impulse to gaze westward returned, and he saw the black steeple as of
yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and half-fabulous world. But now it held a fresh
note of terror for him. He knew the heritage of evil lore it masked, and with the knowledge his
vision ran riot in queer new ways. The birds of spring were returning, and as he watched their
sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt, lone spire as never before. When a flock of
them approached it, he thought, they would wheel and scatter in panic confusion—and he
could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening miles.
It was in June that Blake‘s diary told of his victory over the cryptogram. The text was, he
found, in the dark Aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity, and known to him in a
halting way through previous researches. The diary is strangely reticent about what Blake
deciphered, but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results. There are references
to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by gazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane
conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken of as
holding all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of Blake‘s entries shew
fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds
that the street-lights form a bulwark which cannot be crossed.
Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all time and space, and
tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones
brought it to earth. It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of
Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later
in Lemuria by the first human beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank
with Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from
nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and
did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept
in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver‘s
spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind.
Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake‘s entries, though in so brief and casual
a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution. It appears that a
new fear had been growing on Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church.
The Italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark
windowless steeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their
dreams. Something, they said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark
enough to venture forth. Press items mentioned the long-standing local superstitions, but
failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror. It was obvious that the
young reporters of today are no antiquarians. In writing of these things in his diary, Blake
expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining
Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous
jutting spire. At the same time, however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination,
and admits a morbid longing—pervading even his dreams—to visit the accursed tower and
gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone.
Then something in the Journal on the morning of July 17 threw the diarist into a veritable
fever of horror. It was only a variant of the other half-humorous items about the Federal Hill
restlessness, but to Blake it was somehow very terrible indeed. In the night a thunderstorm
had put the city‘s lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and in that black interval
the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright. Those living near the dreaded church had sworn
that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street-lamps‘ absence and gone down
into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful
way. Toward the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds of the
shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it
fleeing.
When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower, for
even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened, louver-boarded windows was too
much for the thing. It had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in time—for
a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had
called it. During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with
lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas—a guard of
light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness. Once, those nearest the
church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously.
But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake read of what the reporters
had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare, a pair of them had defied
the frantic crowds of Italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after trying
the doors in vain. They found the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in
a singular way, with bits of rotted cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around.
There was a bad odour everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellow stain and patches
of what looked like charring. Opening the door to the tower, and pausing a moment at the
suspicion of a scraping sound above, they found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean.
In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They spoke of the heptagonal stone
pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and the bizarre plaster images; though strangely enough
the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned. What disturbed Blake the
most—except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours—was the final detail that
explained the crashing glass. Every one of the tower‘s lancet windows was broken, and two of
them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pew-linings and
cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior louver-boards. More satin
fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept floor, as if
someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness of
its tightly curtained days.
Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowless spire, but
when a reporter climbed up, opened the horizontally sliding trap-door, and shot a feeble
flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetid space, he saw nothing but darkness, and
an heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture. The verdict, of course, was
charlatanry. Somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some
fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good. Or perhaps some of
the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the outside
world. There was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an officer to verify the reports.
Three men in succession found ways of evading the assignment, and the fourth went very
reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given by the reporters.
From this point onward Blake‘s diary shews a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous
apprehension. He upbraids himself for not doing something, and speculates wildly on the
consequences of another electrical breakdown. It has been verified that on three occasions—
during thunderstorms—he telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein and asked
that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken. Now and then his entries shew
concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the strangely
marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower room. He assumed that these
things had been removed—whither, and by whom or what, he could only guess. But his worst
fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and
that lurking horror in the distant steeple—that monstrous thing of night which his rashness
had called out of the ultimate black spaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will,
and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of
the west window at that far-off, spire-bristling mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city.
His entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening of the
unholy rapport in his sleep. There is mention of a night when he awaked to find himself fully
dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down College Hill toward the west. Again and
again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him.
The week following July 30 is recalled as the time of Blake‘s partial breakdown. He did not
dress, and ordered all his food by telephone. Visitors remarked the cords he kept near his
bed, and he said that sleep-walking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots
which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying.
In his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse. After retiring on
the night of the 30th he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space.
All he could see were short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could smell an
overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds above him. Whenever
he moved he stumbled over something, and at each noise there would come a sort of
answering sound from above—a vague stirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on
wood.
Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top, whilst later he found
himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall, and fumbling his uncertain way
upward toward some region of intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down against
him. Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them
dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled
suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness. He thought of the ancient legends of
Ultimate Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things,
encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin
monotonous piping of a daemoniac flute held in nameless paws.
Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused him to the
unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he never knew—perhaps it was some belated
peal from the fireworks heard all summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various
patron saints, or the saints of their native villages in Italy. In any event he shrieked aloud,
dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the
almost lightless chamber that encompassed him.
He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral staircase,
tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There was a nightmare flight through a vast
cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless
scramble through a littered basement, a climb to regions of air and street-lights outside, and a
mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black
towers, and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door.
On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully
dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of his body seemed sore and
bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched, while a trace of
strange, evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that his nerves
broke down. Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare
from his west window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary.
The great storm broke just before midnight on August 8th. Lightning struck repeatedly in all
parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported. The rain was torrential, while a
constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands. Blake was utterly frantic in
his fear for the lighting system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 a.m., though by
that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety. He recorded everything
in his diary—the large, nervous, and often undecipherable hieroglyphs telling their own story
of growing frenzy and despair, and of entries scrawled blindly in the dark.
He had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window, and it appears that most of his
time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening miles of
downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he
would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases such as ―The lights
must not go‖; ―It knows where I am‖; ―I must destroy it‖; and ―It is calling to me, but perhaps it
means no injury this time‖; are found scattered down two of the pages.
Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2:12 a.m. according to power-house
records, but Blake‘s diary gives no indication of the time. The entry is merely, ―Lights out—
God help me.‖ On Federal Hill there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots
of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles,
electric flashlights, oil lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to
southern Italy. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs of fear with their
right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease
altogether. A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly
dark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he hastened to the
dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could. Of the restless and curious
sounds in the blackened tower, there could be no doubt whatever.
For what happened at 2:35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young, intelligent, and well-
educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monahan of the Central Station, an officer of the
highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of
the seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church‘s high bank wall—especially
those in the square where the eastward facade was visible. Of course there was nothing
which can be proved as being outside the order of Nature. The possible causes of such an
event are many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in
a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building of heterogeneous contents. Mephitic
vapours—spontaneous combustion—pressure of gases born of long decay—any one of
numberless phenomena might be responsible. And then, of course, the factor of conscious
charlatanry can by no means be excluded. The thing was really quite simple in itself, and
covered less than three minutes of actual time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man,
looked at his watch repeatedly.
It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black tower. There had
for some time been a vague exhalation of strange, evil odours from the church, and this had
now become emphatic and offensive. Then at last there was a sound of splintering wood, and
a large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly facade. The
tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground
the people knew that it was the smoke-grimed louver-boarding of that tower‘s east window.
Immediately afterward an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen heights,
choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost prostrating those in the square. At
the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-
blowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the
dripping umbrellas of the crowd. Nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night,
though some upward-looking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of
denser blackness against the inky sky—something like a formless cloud of smoke that shot
with meteor-like speed toward the east.
That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and discomfort, and scarcely
knew what to do, or whether to do anything at all. Not knowing what had happened, they did
not relax their vigil; and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated
lightning, followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, rent the flooded heavens. Half an hour
later the rain stopped, and in fifteen minutes more the street-lights sprang on again, sending
the weary, bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes.
The next day‘s papers gave these matters minor mention in connexion with the general storm
reports. It seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the
Federal Hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the
singular foetor was likewise noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill,
where the crash awaked all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of
speculations. Of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light
near the top of the hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped
the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was agreed that the lone,
sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood, though no trace of
its striking could afterward be found. A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he
saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but
his observation has not been verified. All of the few observers, however, agree as to the
violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated
stroke; whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally
general.
These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connexion with the
death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta house, whose upper rear windows looked
into Blake‘s study, noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of
the 9th, and wondered what was wrong with the expression. When they saw the same face in
the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in his
apartment. Later they rang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the
door.
The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the intruders saw the
glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright on the twisted features, they
turned away in sickened dismay. Shortly afterward the coroner‘s physician made an
examination, and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous tension
induced by electrical discharge, as the cause of death. The hideous expression he ignored
altogether, deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a
person of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these latter
qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in the apartment, and from the
blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk. Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to
the last, and the broken-pointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted
right hand.
The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legible only in part. From
them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic
official verdict, but such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative. The
case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious Dr.
Dexter, who threw the curious box and angled stone—an object certainly self-luminous as
seen in the black windowless steeple where it was found—into the deepest channel of
Narragansett Bay. Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake‘s part, aggravated
by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had uncovered, form the
dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings. These are the entries—or all that
can be made of them.
―Lights still out—must be five minutes now. Everything depends on lightning.
Yaddith grant it will keep up! . . . Some influence seems beating through it. . . . Rain
and thunder and wind deafen. . . . The thing is taking hold of my mind. . . .
―Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before. Other worlds and other
galaxies . . . Dark . . . The lightning seems dark and the darkness seems light. . . .
―It cannot be the real hill and church that I see in the pitch-darkness. Must be
retinal impression left by flashes. Heaven grant the Italians are out with their
candles if the lightning stops!
―What am I afraid of? Is it not an avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in antique and
shadowy Khem even took the form of man? I remember Yuggoth, and more distant
Shaggai, and the ultimate void of the black planets. . . .
―The long, winging flight through the void . . . cannot cross the universe of light . . .
re-created by the thoughts caught in the Shining Trapezohedron . . . send it
through the horrible abysses of radiance. . . .
―My name is Blake—Robert Harrison Blake of 620 East Knapp Street, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. . . . I am on this planet. . . .
―Azathoth have mercy!—the lightning no longer flashes—horrible—I can see
everything with a monstrous sense that is not sight—light is dark and dark is light .
. . those people on the hill . . . guard . . . candles and charms . . . their priests. . . .
―Sense of distance gone—far is near and near is far. No light—no glass—see that
steeple—that tower—window—can hear—Roderick Usher—am mad or going
mad—the thing is stirring and fumbling in the tower—I am it and it is I—I want to
get out . . . must get out and unify the forces. . . . It knows where I am. . . .
―I am Robert Blake, but I see the tower in the dark. There is a monstrous odour . . .
senses transfigured . . . boarding at that tower window cracking and giving way. . . .
Iä . . . ngai . . . ygg. . . .
―I see it—coming here—hell-wind—titan blur—black wings—Yog-Sothoth save
me—the three-lobed burning eye. . . .‖

Fin
como se Angie e Robin fossem se casar e aquilo tudo
fosse somente uma daquelas coisas loucas que estrelas
fazem ao se casar. Mas não dava para fazer com que isso
tivesse sentido, e cada vez que esta voz deste Sam-Eddy
voltava, Mona ficava de cabelos em pé. Ela podia
entender o que Molly estava negociando, contudo: queria
sua ficha limpa, varrida. Havia assistido este vídeo uma
vez com Lanette, sobre esta garota que tinha dez, doze
personalidades que iriam despertar, tipo uma que era
tímida como uma criancinha e a outra que era uma
vagabunda totalmente drogada, mas no vídeo não
aparecia nada sobre como qualquer uma dessas
personalidades faria para apagar sua ficha com a polícia.
***
O hover tinha uma daquelas telas de mapa que se vê nos
táxis, ou se um motorista de caminhão
lhe der uma carona, mas Molly nunca tinha ligado, exceto
naquela primeira vez, para olhar os números que a voz
tinha dado para ela. Depois de um instante, Mona
entendeu que Angie estava lhe
dizendo qual caminho seguir, ou pelo menos aquelas
vozes estavam lhe dizendo. Mona estava esperando que
ficasse claro logo já havia um tempo, contudo ainda era
noite quando Molly desligou as luzes e acelerou através
da escuridão...
– Luzes! – gritou Angie.
– Relaxe – disse Molly, e Mona lembrou-se de como ela se
movimentou no escuro, noconsultório de Gerald. Mas o hover desacelerou
suavemente, fez uma curva longa, sacudindo sobre o
chão áspero. As luzes do painel se apagaram, todos os
instrumentos. – Nenhum som agora, ok?
O hover acelerou através da escuridão.
Havia uma luz branca bem alto. Através da janela, Mona
avistou um ponto que avançava, girando; sobre ele,
alguma outra coisa, cheia de bulbos e cinzenta...
– Pra baixo! Abaixa ela!
Mona se jogou para arrancar o cinto de segurança de
Angie enquanto alguma coisa batia contra
a lateral do hover. Jogou-a no chão e envolveu suas peles
ao seu redor enquanto Molly girava para a esquerda,
roçando de lado em alguma coisa que Mona não viu.
Olhou para cima: um flash de um segundo de um prédio
negro em frangalhos, uma única lâmpada branca sobre
as portas do armazém,
e estavam lá dentro, a turbina gritando em reversão
total.
Batida.
***
Não tenho a menor ideia, disse a voz, e Mona pensou:
Bem, eu sei como é isso.
E a voz começou a rir, e não parou, e a risada se tornou
um som intermitente, um som que já
não era mais risada, e Mona abriu os olhos.Havia uma garota lá com uma lanterna minúscula, do
tipo que Lanette mantinha no seu enorme
molho de chaves; Mona a viu na luz fraca refletida, o
cone de luz sobre o rosto de Angie. Então ela viu Mona
olhando e o som parou.
– Quem são vocês? – A luz nos olhos de Mona. Voz de
Cleveland, um rostinho forte de raposa
debaixo de um cabelo loiro descolorido e descuidado.
– Mona. E quem é você? – Mas, então, ela viu o martelo.
– Cherry...
– O que é esse martelo?
A tal Cherry olhou para o martelo. – Alguém está atrás de
mim e de Slick. – Ela olhou para Mona novamente. – Você
está com eles?
– Acho que não.
– Você se parece com ela. – A luz atingindo Angie.
– Não as minhas mãos. De qualquer jeito, eu não era
assim.
– Vocês duas se parecem com Angie Mitchell.
– Sim. Ela é.
Cherry estremeceu um pouco. Estava vestindo três ou
quatro jaquetas de couro que ela tinha tomado de
namorados diferentes; era uma mania de Cleveland.– Para este alto castelo – surgiu a voz na boca de Angie,
grossa como lama, e Cherry bateu sua
cabeça de encontro ao teto da cabine, derrubando o
martelo – meu cavalo está vindo. – No facho de luz
vacilante da lanterna de chaveiro de Cherry, elas viram
os músculos do rosto de Angie se contorcerem debaixo
da pele. – Por que vocês se demoram aqui, irmãzinhas,
agora que o casamento
dela está acertado?
O rosto de Angie relaxou, tornou-se o seu próprio,
enquanto um fio de sangue brilhante escorria de sua
narina esquerda. Ela abriu os olhos, recuando na luz. –
Onde está ela? – perguntou para Mona.
– Sumiu – disse Mona. – Me disse para ficar aqui com
você...
– Quem? – perguntou Cherry.
– Molly – respondeu Mona. – Ela estava dirigindo...
***
Cherry queria encontrar alguém chamado Slick. Mona
queria que Molly voltasse e dissesse a ela
o que fazer, mas Cherry estava inquieta quanto a
permanecer ali embaixo no andar térreo, disse, porque
havia essas pessoas lá fora, com armas. Mona lembrou o
som, alguma coisa atingindo o hover; então pegou a
lanterna de Cherry e foi olhar. Havia um buraco onde ela
podia enfiar o dedo, na metade superior da lateral
direita, e um maior – dois dedos – na lateral esquerda.Cherry disse que era melhor subirem, para onde Slick
provavelmente estava, antes que aquelas
pessoas decidissem entrar ali. Mona não estava certa
disso.
– Vamos lá – disse Cherry. – Slick provavelmente voltou
para lá, com Gentry e o Conde...
– O que você disse? – E era a voz de Angie Mitchell,
igualzinha aos stims.
***
Seja lá o que fosse aquilo, fazia um frio dos diabos
quando saíram do hover – as pernas de Mona estavam
nuas – mas o amanhecer estava chegando, finalmente:
ela podia distinguir retângulos
fracos que eram provavelmente janelas, somente um
brilho cinza. A garota chamada Cherry as conduzia para
algum lugar, disse que era para cima, orientando-se com
a pequena claridade da luz do chaveiro, Angie perto,
atrás dela, e Mona na retaguarda.
O bico do sapato de Mona ficou preso em algo que fazia
um som de chocalho. Abaixou-se para
soltá-lo e encontrou o que parecia ser um saco de
plástico. Grudento. Coisas pequenas dentro.
Respirou fundo e levantou-se, enfiando o saco dentro do
bolso lateral da jaqueta de Michael.
Então subiram umas escadas estreitas, degraus altos,
quase uma escada de mão, as peles de Angie roçando amão de Mona no corrimão frio e áspero. Então uma
saída, e uma volta, outro lance
de escadas, outra saída. Um vento soprou de algum
lugar.
– É um tipo de ponte – disse Cherry. – Basta caminhar
rápido através dela, porque ela se move
um pouco...
***
E não esperando aquilo, nada daquilo, não o cômodo
branco e alto, as prateleiras arqueadas repletas de livros
em mal estado – ela pensou no velho –, a coleção de
coisas de console com cabos enrolados por todo lado;
não este cara vestido de preto, magro e com olhos febris,
com seu cabelo penteado para trás numa crista que
chamavam de “peixe de briga” em Cleveland; não a
risada dele quando as viu lá, nem tampouco o cara
morto.
Mona já havia visto gente morta antes, o suficiente para
saber quando era o caso. A cor daquilo.
Algumas vezes, na Flórida, alguém se deitava em uma
pilha de papelão na calçada, do lado de fora do edifício
abandonado. Simplesmente não se levantava mais.
Roupas e pele ficavam da cor da calçada, de qualquer
forma, mas ainda diferente quando batiam as botas,
outra cor debaixo daquela. Um caminhão branco vinha,
então. Eddy disse que, se não fizessem isso, eles
inchariam. Como um gato
que Mona havia visto uma vez, cheio como uma bola de
basquete, virado de costas, pernas e rabo apontandopara cima, duros como tábuas, e aquilo fez Eddy rir.
E este artista do wiz rindo agora – Mona reconhecia o
olhar – e Cherry grunhindo, ou perto disso, e Angie
apenas parada lá.
– Ok, todo mundo – ouviu alguém dizer –, Molly – e virou-
se para encontrá-la no umbral da porta, com uma
pequena arma na mão e aquele cara enorme de cabelo
sujo ao lado dela, parecendo
completamente estúpido –, apenas fiquem quietos até
que eu coloque ordem nessa história.
O cara magrelo apenas riu.
– Cala a boca – disse Molly, como se estivesse pensando
noutra coisa. Ela atirou sem nem mesmo olhar para a
arma. Um flash azul na parede ao lado da cabeça do cara
e Mona não ouvia mais
nada a não ser seus ouvidos zunindo.
O magrelo se dobrou no chão, as mãos entre os joelhos.
Angie caminhou em direção à maca onde o cara morto
estava deitado, seus olhos brancos.
Devagar, devagar como se estivesse se movendo
debaixo da água, e aquele olhar em seu rosto...
A mão de Mona, no bolso da jaqueta, estava meio que
tentando descobrir alguma coisa por conta própria. Meio
que apertando o Ziploc que tinha apanhado no chão, lá
embaixo, contando a ela...
que havia wiz dentro.Puxou para fora do bolso e realmente tinha. Grudento
com sangue ainda secando. Três cristais
dentro e algum tipo de derma.
Não sabia por que tinha puxado aquilo, logo ali, exceto
que ninguém estava se mexendo.
O cara, usando a crista “peixe de briga” tinha se
sentado, mas ficou quieto. Angie continuava perto da
maca e não parecia estar olhando para o cara morto,
mas sim para uma caixa cinza, presa
sobre sua cabeça numa espécie de moldura. Cherry de
Cleveland tinha se encostado contra uma parede de
livros e meio que estava mordendo os dedos dentro da
boca. O cara grandão estava em pé
ao lado de Molly, a cabeça dela pendendo para um lado,
com se estivesse ouvindo alguma coisa.
Mona não podia suportar aquilo.
A mesa tinha a superfície de aço. Um pedaço grande de
metal velho sobre ela, segurando uma
pilha empoeirada de papéis impressos. Colocou os três
cristais amarelos sobre a mesa, como botões
enfileirados, pegou a barra de metal e – um, dois, três –
esmagou-os até virarem pó. Foi o que bastou: todos
olharam. Exceto Angie.
– Com licença – Mona se ouviu dizer, enquanto varria o
monte de pó amarelo bruto sobre a palma da mão
esquerda – sendo como é... – Ela enterrou o nariz no
monte e aspirou. – Às vezes –acrescentou, e aspirou o resto.
Ninguém falou nada.
E novamente estava tudo parado. Como antes.
Tão rápido que tudo estava parado.
O Final dos Tempos. O Final dos Tempos está chegando.
Tão rápido, tão quieto, ela podia até mesmo colocar em
sequência o que viria a seguir: a risada
alta, haha, como se não fosse realmente uma risada.
Através de um alto-falante. Através da porta.
Vindo de fora, da passarela. E Molly se vira, suave como
seda, rápida, mas como se não houvesse pressa, e a
pequena arma dispara como um isqueiro.
Então há um flash azul de fora e o cara grande fica
salpicado de sangue vindo de lá, enquanto o
metal velho se rompe e Cherry está gritando antes que a
passarela bata com este som alto e complexo, o chão
escuro lá embaixo onde ela havia encontrado o wiz em
seu saco ensanguentado.
– Gentry – alguém disse, e ela viu que era o pequeno
vídeo na mesa, o rosto de um rapaz jovem
nele –, conecte a unidade de controle de Slick agora. Eles
estão dentro do prédio. – O cara com o peixe de briga se
move e começa a fazer coisas com fios e consoles.
E Mona podia apenas assistir, porque estava tão imóvel e
era tudo muito interessante.Como o cara grande dá um grito e corre para cima,
gritando que são dele, são dele. Como o rosto na tela diz:
– Slick, deixa disso, você não precisa mais deles...
Então este motor começou a funcionar, em algum lugar
lá embaixo, e Mona ouve um barulho
metálico e depois alguém gritando, no andar debaixo.
E o sol estava entrando pela janela alta e estreita, então
ela se mexeu para dar uma olhada. E
havia alguma coisa lá fora, tipo um caminhão ou hover,
só que soterrado debaixo de uma pilha do
que pareciam ser refrigeradores, refrigeradores novinhos,
e pedaços quebrados de contêineres plásticos, e alguém
num traje camuflado, deitado para baixo com o rosto na
neve, e mais adiante havia outro hover que parecia
totalmente incendiado.
Era interessante.

CETIM ROSA
Angela Mitchell compreende este lugar e seus habitantes
por meio de planos de dados
movediços que representam pontos de vista, embora, na
maioria dos casos, esteja em dúvida quanto a quem ou a
quê os pontos de vista pertençam. Há um grau
considerável de sobreposição, de contradição.
O homem com o cabelo de crista despenteada, usando a
jaqueta de couro preto é Thomas TrailGentry (uma massa de dados e dígitos de SIN passam),
sem endereço fixo (uma faceta diferente lhe
informa que este lugar pertence a ele). Passando por um
fluxo cinzento de traços de dados oficiais, vagamente
padronizado com repetidas suspeitas rosadas do
Departamento de Fissão sobre fraude em
seus serviços, ela o descobre sob outra luz: ele é como
um dos cowboys de Bobby; apesar de jovem, é como os
velhos do Gentleman Loser; é um autodidata, um
excêntrico, obcecado, vê a si mesmo como um erudito; é
louco, uma ave noturna, culpado (na visão de Mamman,
na visão de Legba) de
múltiplas heresias; Lady 3Jane, em seu próprio esquema
excêntrico, arquivou-o em RIMBAUD. (Outro
rosto para Angie a partir da entrada de RIMBAUD; seu
nome é Riviera, personagem secundário em seus
sonhos.) Molly deliberadamente o atordoou, fazendo com
que um dardo detonasse a 18
centímetros do crânio.
Molly, como a garota Mona, não possui SIN, seu
nascimento não tem registro, ainda que ao redor de seu
nome (nomes) surjam galáxias de suposições, boatos,
dados conflitantes. Vagabunda de rua, prostituta, guarda-
costas, assassina, ela se mistura em múltiplos planos
com as sombras de heróis e vilões cujos nomes nada
significam para Angie, embora suas imagens residuais
tenham, há
muito, se entretecido à cultura global. (E isto também
pertenceu a 3Jane, e agora pertence a Angie.) Molly
acaba de matar um homem, tendo disparado um de seusdardos explosivos dentro da garganta dele. Seu colapso
contra um trilho de aço que sofria de fadiga metálica fez
com que o metal cedesse, fazendo com que uma boa
parte da passarela caísse no chão abaixo. Este cômodo
não possui outra entrada, um fato de alguma importância
estratégica. Provavelmente não era a intenção de Molly
causar o colapso da passarela. Ela tentou impedir o
homem, um mercenário contratado, de usar sua
arma preferida, uma escopeta com um acabamento
escuro e antirreflexivo. De qualquer forma, o loft de
Gentry estava agora, efetivamente, isolado.
Angie compreende a importância de Molly para 3Jane, a
fonte de seu desejo por ela e a raiva contra ela; sabendo
isso, vê toda a banalidade da maldade humana.
Angie vê Molly vagando incansavelmente na Londres de
um inverno cinza, uma garota ao seu
lado – e sabe, sem saber como sabe, que esta mesma
garota está agora no número 23 da Margate Road, SW2.
(Continuidade?) O pai da garota foi anteriormente o
mestre do homem chamado Swain, que recentemente
havia se tornado servo de 3Jane em troca da informação
que ela fornece àqueles a seu comando. Assim como
Robin Lanier, é claro, embora ele espere ser pago numa
moeda diferente.
Pela garota Mona, Angie sente um carinho peculiar,
compaixão, um grau de inveja: embora Mona tenha sido
alterada para se parecer com Angie o máximo possível, a
vida de Mona não deixou
traço algum na tessitura das coisas e representa, no
sistema de Legba, a coisa mais próxima de inocência.Cherry-Lee Chesterfield surge envolta em um triste
rascunho esgarçado, seu perfil de
informações como o desenho de uma criança: intimações
por vagabundagem, dívidas insignificantes,
uma carreira interrompida como técnica paramédica
Nível 6, em torno disso, dados de nascimento e
SIN.
Slick, ou Slick Henry, está entre os que não possuem SIN,
mas 3Jane, Continuidade, Bobby, todos
centraram suas atenções nele. Para 3Jane, ele serve
como o foco de um nodo secundário de associações: ela
equacionou seu rito de construção progressivo – sua
resposta catártica ao trauma quimiopenal – às suas
próprias tentativas frustradas de exorcizar o sonho árido
de Tessier-Ashpool.
Nos corredores da memória de 3Jane, Angie
frequentemente se deparou com uma câmara onde um
manipulador com patas de aranha move os refugos da
história breve e densa de Straylight – um ato
de extensa colagem. E Bobby fornece outras memórias,
gravadas do artista enquanto ele acessava a
biblioteca de Babel de 3Jane: seu trabalho lento, triste,
infantil na planície chamada Dog Solitude, erguendo
novamente as formas de dor e memória.
Lá embaixo, na escuridão gelada do chão da Fábrica,
uma das esculturas cinéticas de Slick, controlada por umsubprograma de Bobby, remove o braço esquerdo de
outro mercenário,
empregando um mecanismo recuperado, dois verões,
atrás de uma colheitadeira fabricada na China.
O mercenário, cujo nome e SIN passaram por Angie como
bolhas quentes e prateadas, morre com sua
bochecha de encontro a uma das botas de Little Bird.
Somente Bobby, entre todas as pessoas nesta sala, não
está aqui como dados. E Bobby não é a
coisa deteriorada diante dela, presa em metal e nylon,
seu queixo recoberto por vômito seco, nem mesmo o
rosto ávido e familiar contemplando-a de um monitor na
mesa de trabalho de Gentry. Será
Bobby o volume retangular de memória preso sobre a
maca?
Agora ela caminha através de dunas ondulantes de cetim
rosa, manchado sob um céu de aço modelado, livre,
finalmente, da sala e de seus dados.
***
Brigitte caminha ao lado dela, e não há pressão, não há o
vazio da noite, não há o som da colmeia. Não há velas.
Continuidade está lá também, representado por um
boneco de palitos prateados movendo-se ao lado delas e
que a faz lembrar, de alguma forma, de Hilton Swift na
praia em Malibu.
– Sentindo-se melhor? – pergunta Brigitte.– Bem melhor, obrigada.
– Foi o que pensei.
– Por que Continuidade está aqui?
– Porque ele é seu primo, construído de biochips Maas.
Porque ele é jovem. Nós caminhamos
com você para o seu casamento.
– Mas quem é você, Brigitte? O que você é na realidade?
– Eu sou a mensagem que pediram que seu pai
escrevesse. Eu sou os veves que ele desenhou em
sua cabeça. – Brigitte se aproximou. – Seja gentil com
Continuidade. Ele teme que, em sua falta de jeito, a
tenha deixado descontente.
O boneco de palitos correu à frente dela, através das
dunas de cetim, para anunciar a chegada da
noiva.

SR. YANAKA
A unidade Maas-Neotek ainda estava quente ao toque; a
base inferior de plástico estava descolorida, como se
fosse pelo calor. Um cheiro de cabelo queimado...
Ela observava as feridas no rosto de Tick escurecerem.
Ele tinha pedido que ela fosse pegar uma
caixa de cigarros desgastada, cheia de pílulas e dermas,
num armário ao lado da cama. Tinha aberto seucolarinho e pressionado três discos adesivos contra a
pele branca como porcelana.
Kumiko o ajudou a improvisar uma atadura usando um
pedaço de cabo óptico.
– Mas Colin disse que ela tinha esquecido...
– Mas eu não – disse ele, e sugou o ar entre os dentes,
ajustando a atadura debaixo do braço. –
Pareceu ter acontecido, na hora. Demora um pouco... –
Fez uma careta de dor.
– Sinto muito...
– Tudo bem. Sally me contou. Sobre sua mãe, quero dizer.
– Sim... – Ela não desviou o olhar. – Ela se suicidou. Em
Tóquio...
– Fosse quem fosse, não era sua mãe.
– A unidade... – Ela deu uma olhada na direção da mesa
de café.
– Ela a queimou. Ele não vai se importar, contudo. Ainda
está lá. Domina o lugar. O que nossa
Sally está tramando, então?
– Ela está com Angela Mitchell. Foi procurar a coisa de
onde tudo isso se origina. O constructo
onde nós estávamos. Foi para um lugar chamado Nova
Jersey.
O telefone tocou.O pai de Kumiko, cabeça e ombros, na ampla tela atrás
do telefone de Tick: vestia seu terno escuro, seu relógio
Rolex, uma constelação de pequenos símbolos de
irmandades em sua lapela.
Kumiko achou que ele parecia muito cansado, cansado e
muito sério, um homem sério atrás da extensão lisa e
escura da escrivaninha em seu escritório. Vendo-o ali,
lamentou que Sally não tivesse telefonado de uma
cabine com uma câmera. Ela teria gostado muito de ver
Sally novamente; agora,
isso talvez fosse impossível.
– Você parece bem, Kumiko – disse seu pai.
Kumiko sentou-se muito reta, encarando a pequena
câmera montada logo abaixo do telão. Por
puro reflexo, ela invocou a máscara de desdém de sua
mãe, mas ela não surgiu. Confusa, baixou o
olhar para suas mãos dobradas sobre o seu colo. Tornou-
se abruptamente consciente da presença de
Tick, de seu constrangimento, seu medo, aprisionado na
cadeira ao lado dela, bem à frente da câmera.
– Você estava certa em fugir da casa de Swain – disse
seu pai.
Ela encontrou seus olhos novamente. – Ele é seu kobun.
– Não mais. Enquanto estávamos distraídos, aqui, com
nossas próprias dificuldades, ele formoualianças novas e duvidosas, seguindo caminhos que não
poderíamos aprovar.
– E suas dificuldades, Pai?
Havia a centelha de um sorriso? – Tudo está terminado.
Ordem e harmonia foram
restabelecidas.
– Hã, com licença, senhor, sr. Yanaka – começou Tick,
depois pareceu perder completamente a
voz.
– Sim. E você é...?
O rosto machucado de Tick contraiu-se numa enorme e
particularmente triste piscadela.
– O nome dele é Tick, Pai. Ele me deu abrigo e me
protegeu. Junto com Col... com a unidade Maas-Neotek,
ele salvou minha vida esta noite.
– Verdade? Não fui informado disso. Eu tinha a impressão
de que você não havia saído do apartamento dele.
Alguma coisa fria – Como? – perguntou, sentando-se
mais à frente. – Como você poderia saber?
– A unidade Maas-Neotek transmitia suas coordenadas,
uma vez que fossem conhecidas – uma
vez que a unidade estivesse livre dos sistemas de Swain.
Nós despachamos observadores para a área.
– Ela se lembrou do vendedor de noodles... – Sem
informar Swain, é claro. Mas a unidade não chegou atransmitir uma segunda mensagem.
– Foi quebrada. Um acidente.
– Ainda assim, você diz que salvou sua vida?
– Senhor – disse Tick –, queira me perdoar, o que eu
queria perguntar, sabe, é se estou coberto...
– Coberto?
– Protegido. De Swain, quero dizer, dele e dos amigos
que ele comprou no Special Branch e os
outros todos...
– Swain está morto.
Houve um silêncio. – Mas alguém vai mandar naquilo,
certamente. O grupo, quero dizer. Seu negócio.
O sr. Yanaka olhou para Tick com franca curiosidade. – É
claro. De que outra forma poderíamos esperar que a
ordem e a harmonia se mantivessem?
– Dê a ele a sua palavra, Pai – disse Kumiko –, de que
nada de mal irá lhe acontecer.
Yanaka olhou de Kumiko para um ansioso Tick. – Eu
estendo profunda gratidão para você, senhor, por ter
protegido minha filha. Estou em dívida com você.
– Giri – disse Kumiko.
– Cristo – disse Tick, superando o temor –, do caralho,
isso.– Pai – disse Kumiko –, na noite da morte de minha mãe,
você ordenou aos secretários para deixá-la sair sozinha?
O rosto de seu pai estava muito imóvel. Ela observou-o
encher-se com uma dor que nunca havia
visto antes. – Não – disse ele finalmente –, eu não
ordenei.
Tick tossiu.
– Obrigada, Pai. Vou voltar a Tóquio agora?
– Certamente, se for o seu desejo. Embora tenham me
dito que você não pôde ver muito de Londres. Meu sócio
vai chegar em breve ao apartamento do Sr. Tick. Se você
quiser permanecer para explorar a cidade, ele cuidará
disso.
– Obrigada, Pai.
– Adeus, Kumi.
E ele se foi.
– Bem, certo – disse Tick, fazendo uma careta horrível
enquanto estendia seu braço bom –, me
ajude a tirar isso...
– Mas você requer cuidados médicos.
– Não é mesmo? – Deu um jeito de se levantar e estava
mancando em direção ao banheiro quando Petal abriu a
porta do vestíbulo escuro no andar de cima. – Se tiver
quebrado meu maldito cadeado – disse Tick –, é melhor
me pagar por ele.– Desculpe – disse Petal, piscando. – Eu vim buscar a
srta. Yanaka.
– Levou azar, camarada. Acabamos de falar com o pai
dela no telefone. Disse que Swain já era.
Falou que iria mandar o novo chefão. – Ele sorriu, de
forma entortada, triunfal.
– Mas, justamente – disse Petal, de forma gentil –, sou eu.
42
CHÃO DA FÁBRICA
Cherry ainda está gritando.
– Alguém faz ela calar a boca – disse Molly, de onde
estava, de pé, perto da porta, com sua pequena arma, e
Mona pensa que pode fazer isso, pode passar para
Cherry um pouco de sua própria
tranquilidade, onde tudo é interessante e não há pressão
demais, mas no caminho através da sala ela vê o Ziploc
amassado no chão e lembra que há um derma lá dentro,
talvez alguma coisa que ajude
Cherry a se acalmar. – Aqui – diz ela, ao se aproximar,
tirar a parte de trás e grudar o derma no lado do pescoço
de Cherry. Os gritos de Cherry descem de tom até se
tornarem um gargarejo enquanto ela vai escorregando
pela parede de velhos livros, mas Mona tem certeza de
que ela ficará bem, e de qualquer modo há tiros lá
embaixo, armas: passando por Molly, uma traçante
branca ricocheteando e batendo nas vigas de aço em
volta e Molly gritando para Gentry se ele pode ligar
aquelas malditas luzes?Tinha que ser as luzes do andar de baixo, porque as luzes
aqui em cima eram bem brilhantes, tão
brilhantes que ela podia ver pequenos pontinhos
embaçados, traços de cor que se propagavam das coisas,
se ela olhasse de perto. Traçantes. É como chamam
aquelas balas, aquelas que se acendem.
Eddy contou a ela sobre isso na Flórida, olhando para a
praia onde um segurança privado as disparava no
escuro.
– Claro, luzes – o rosto na telinha disse. – A Bruxa não
pode ver... – Mona sorriu para ele. Ela
não achava que os outros tinham ouvido. Bruxa?
Então Gentry e o grande Slick estavam puxando com
força uns fios amarelos da parede, onde
haviam sido presos com fita adesiva prateada, e
conectando-os a umas caixas de metal, e Cherry de
Cleveland estava sentada no chão com seus olhos
fechados, e Molly estava agachada perto da porta
segurando a arma com as duas mãos, e Angie estava ...
Fique quieta.
Ela ouviu alguém dizer aquilo, mas não havia ninguém na
sala. Ela pensou que talvez fosse Lanette, como se fosse
algo que Lanette pudesse dizer, através do tempo,
através da quietude.
Porque Angie estava logo ali, abaixada no chão ao lado
da maca com o cara morto, suas pernasdobradas embaixo como se fosse uma estátua, seus
braços ao redor dele.
As luzes diminuíram quando Gentry e Slick encontraram
sua conexão, e ela pensou ouvir o rosto no monitor
ofegar, mas ela já estava se movendo em direção a
Angie, vendo (de repente, totalmente, tão claro que doía)
o fino fio de sangue escorrendo de sua orelha esquerda.
Mesmo assim, a quietude se manteve, embora já
pudesse sentir os pontos quentes e doloridos no
fundo de sua garganta, lembrar-se de Lanette
explicando: nunca aspire isso, vai fazer buracos em você.
E as costas de Molly estavam retas, seus braços
esticados... em linha reta para a frente e para baixo, não
para a caixa cinza, mas para sua pistola, aquela coisinha,
e Mona ouviu quando ela fez snik–snik–snik, e depois três
explosões, longe lá embaixo, e devem ter produzido
flashes azuis, mas as mãos de Mona estavam ao redor de
Angie agora, seus pulsos escovados pelo casaco de pele
tingido de sangue. Para olhar dentro dos olhos ausentes,
a luz já se extinguindo. Somente um longo, o mais longo
dos caminhos para longe.
– Ei – disse Mona, ninguém para ouvir, apenas Angie
recostada sobre o cadáver no saco de dormir – ei...
Ela deu uma olhada a tempo de pegar uma última
imagem na tela de vídeo e vê-la desaparecer.
***
Depois disso, por um longo tempo, nada importava. Nada
parecido com o ‘não se importar ’ datranquilidade, o overdrive do cristal de wiz, e também
não era como uma ressaca, apenas a sensação de algo
superado, talvez do jeito que um fantasma se sente.
Ela ficou ao lado de Slick e Molly no vão da porta e olhou
para baixo. Sob a luz fraca das velhas lâmpadas grandes,
ela observou a coisa em forma de aranha de metal
inquietando-se através do chão de concreto sujo. Tinha
grandes lâminas curvas que estalavam e giravam
quando se movia, mas não
havia ninguém lá se mexendo, e a coisa apenas seguia
como um brinquedo quebrado, para a frente e
para trás nos destroços retorcidos da pequena ponte que
ela havia cruzado com Angie e Cherry.
Cherry havia se levantado do chão, pálida e com o rosto
impassível, e retirou o derma do pescoço. – Isséum
relaxan musc’lar muuuit’forti – foi o que conseguiu dizer,
e Mona se sentiu mal porque sabia que havia feito
alguma coisa estúpida quando pensou que estava
tentando ajudar, mas o wiz sempre agia assim, e como é
que ela não conseguia parar de fazer aquilo?
Porque você está chapada, estúpida, ouviu Lanette dizer,
mas não queria se lembrar daquilo.
Então todos eles ficaram parados lá, olhando para baixo,
na direção da aranha metálica que se
retorcia e se descarregava. Todos exceto Gentry, que
estava desparafusando a caixa cinza de sua estrutura
sobre a maca, suas botas pretas ao lado da pele
vermelha de Angie.
– Ouçam – disse Molly. – É um helicóptero. Dos grandes.***
Ela foi a última na corda, tirando Gentry que disse
apenas que não iria, não se importava, ele ficaria.
A corda era grossa, suja e cinza e tinha nós ao longo de
sua extensão nos quais era possível se
pendurar, como um balanço de que se lembrava de
muito tempo atrás. Slick e Molly baixaram a caixa cinza
antes, para uma plataforma onde as escadas de metal
não estavam destruídas. Então Molly desceu como um
esquilo, parecendo mal se segurar na corda e amarrou-a
firme em um corrimão.
Slick desceu devagar, porque ele carregava Cherry em
seus ombros e ela ainda estava muito relaxada para
conseguir descer sozinha. Mona continuava se sentindo
mal por causa daquilo e se perguntou se era o motivo
pelo qual decidiram deixá-la lá.
Foi Molly quem decidiu, contudo, ficar lá perto da janela,
observando pessoas saltarem de um
longo helicóptero preto e espalharem-se através da neve.
– Olhem para aquilo – disse Molly. – Eles sabem. Vieram
recolher os pedaços. Sense/Net. Vou
sair fora daqui.
Cherry gaguejou que eles também estavam partindo, ela
e Slick. E Slick sacudiu os ombros, então sorriu e colocou
seu braço ao redor dela.
– E quanto a mim?Molly olhou para ela. Ou pelo menos pareceu olhar. Não
dava para dizer ao certo, com as lentes.
Dentes brancos apareceram de encontro ao seu lábio
inferior, por apenas um segundo, então ela disse: – Você
fica, é meu conselho. Deixa que eles resolvam o que
fazer. Na prática, você não fez nada. Nada disso foi ideia
sua. Acho que provavelmente irão compensar você, ou
tentarão. Sim, você fica.
Não fez sentido algum para Mona, mas agora ela se
sentia tão morta, tão acabada, que não poderia discutir.
E então eles apenas se foram lá para baixo usando a
corda e sumiram, e era só isso, como as
pessoas iam embora e você nunca mais as via
novamente. Ela olhou para trás, para dentro do quarto e
viu Gentry caminhando para a frente e para trás em
frente aos seus livros, correndo a ponta de seu dedo por
eles como se estivesse procurando por algum em
especial. Ele havia jogado um cobertor
sobre a maca.
Então ela apenas foi embora e não saberia dizer se
Gentry acabou encontrando seu livro ou não,
mas era como deveria ser, então ela desceu pela corda
sozinha, o que não foi tão fácil quanto Molly e Slick
fizeram parecer, sobretudo se você se sentisse como
Mona se sentia, porque Mona chegou tão
perto de apagar e seus braços e pernas não pareciam
estar funcionando bem, de qualquer maneira, ela meio
que precisou se concentrar para que eles se movessem,
e seu nariz e sua garganta estavam inchados por dentro,então ela nem percebeu o cara negro até chegar lá
embaixo.
Ele estava em pé lá, olhando para a coisa grande em
forma de aranha, que não se movia mais.
Olhou para cima quando o salto dela rangeu na
plataforma de aço. E alguma coisa tão triste no rosto
dele, quando ela o viu, mas então desapareceu e ele
estava escalando os degraus de metal, devagar e
pacientemente, e enquanto se aproximava ela começou
a se perguntar se realmente era negro. Não apenas a
cor, que definitivamente era, mas havia alguma coisa
quanto ao formato de sua cabeça raspada, os ângulos de
seu rosto, nada parecido com algo que ela já tinha visto
antes. Ele era alto, realmente alto. Vestia um longo
casaco preto, de um couro tão fino que se movia como
seda.
– Olá, fofa – disse ele, quando parou em sua frente,
estendendo a mão para erguer o queixo dela
de forma que ela estava olhando diretamente para olhos
cor de ágata com manchas douradas, do tipo que
ninguém no mundo tem. Dedos longos tão leves de
encontro ao seu queixo. – Fofa – disse ele –, quantos anos
você tem?
– Dezesseis...
– Você precisa de um corte de cabelo – disse ele, e havia
algo muito sério na forma como disse
aquilo.
– Angie está lá em cima – disse ela, apontando, quando
sua voz retornou. – Ela está...– Pssst...
Ela ouviu sons de metal ao longe, no velho prédio
grande, e então um motor dando partida. O
hover, pensou, aquele com que Molly havia chegado
aqui.
O homem negro ergueu as sobrancelhas, exceto que ele
não tinha sobrancelha alguma. –
Amigos? – Ele baixou a mão.
Ela concordou com a cabeça.
– Acho que isso basta – disse ele, e pegou a mão dela
para ajudá-la a descer os degraus. No pé
da escada, ainda segurando a mão dela, conduziu-a ao
redor dos escombros da passarela. Alguém estava morto
lá, roupa de camuflagem e uma daquelas coisas de falar
alto que os tiras têm.
– Swift – o homem negro chamou, através daquele alto
espaço vazio, entre as esquadrias pretas
das janelas sem vidros, linhas negras de encontro a um
céu branco, manhã de inverno –, venha até aqui. Eu a
encontrei.
– Mas eu não sou ela...
E lá, onde as grandes portas continuavam abertas,
contra o céu e a neve e a ferrugem, ela viu aquele
figurão caminhando em sua direção, casaco aberto e
gravata esvoaçando ao vento, e o hoverde Molly passando ao lado dele, para fora daquelas
mesmas portas e ele nem mesmo estava olhando,
porque estava olhando para Mona.
– Não sou Angie – disse, e se perguntou se deveria dizer
a ele o que havia visto, Angie e o jovem, juntos, naquela
pequena tela, um pouco antes de desaparecer.
– Eu sei – disse o cara negro –, mas é algo que cresce em
você.
O Final dos Tempos. O Final dos Tempos está chegando.

JUIZ
A mulher levou-os para um hover estacionado dentro da
Fábrica, se aquilo ainda puder ser chamado de
estacionar, já que a extremidade da frente estava
esmagada ao redor de uma bancada de
concreto para ferramentas. Era um cargueiro branco com
CATHODE CATHAY escrito ao longo das portas traseiras e
Slick se perguntou quando ela tinha conseguido entrar
com aquilo lá dentro sem que ele ouvisse. Talvez
enquanto Bobby, o Conde, estivesse promovendo sua
distração com o dirigível.
O aleph era pesado, como tentar carregar um pequeno
bloco de motor.
Ele não queria olhar para a Bruxa, porque havia sangue
em suas lâminas e ele não a havia construído para
aquilo. Havia alguns corpos ao redor, ou partes deles;
não queria olhar para aquilo, tampouco.Olhou para baixo, para o bloco de biosoft e seu pacote de
baterias e se perguntou se aquilo tudo
ainda estava lá, a casa cinza e o México e os olhos de
3Jane.
– Esperem – disse a mulher. Estavam passando pela
rampa que dava para o quarto onde ele mantinha suas
máquinas; o Juiz ainda estava lá, assim como o Triturador
de Cadáveres...
Ela ainda segurava a arma. Slick colocou sua mão no
ombro de Cherry. – Ela disse para esperar.
– Aquela coisa que eu vi, noite passada – disse a mulher.
– O robô de um braço só. Ele funciona?
– Sim...
– É forte? Pode transportar uma carga? Sobre terreno
acidentado?
– Claro.
– Pegue-o.
– Hã?
– Coloque-o na traseira do hover. Agora. Mexa-se.
Cherry grudou nele, com os joelhos ainda fracos por
causa do que quer que fosse que a outra
garota tivesse dado a ela.
– Você – Molly fez um gesto em direção a ela com a arma
– entra no hover.– Vai – disse Slick.
Ele largou o aleph e caminhou sobre a rampa para o
quarto onde o Juiz aguardava nas sombras,
o braço ao seu lado na lona, onde Slick o havia deixado.
Nunca iria acertar aquilo, a forma como a serra deveria
trabalhar. Havia uma unidade de controle ali, numa fileira
de prateleiras de metal empoeiradas. Ele a pegou e ligou
o Juiz, a carapaça marrom tremendo levemente.
Movimentou o Juiz para a frente, descendo a rampa, os
pés largos descendo, um-dois, um-dois,
os giros compensando, contrabalançando o braço que
faltava. A mulher tinha as portas traseiras do hover
abertas, prontas, e Slick marchou o Juiz diretamente para
ela. Ela recuou um pouco quando o Juiz se agigantou à
sua frente, suas lentes prateadas refletindo a ferrugem
polida. Slick surgiu detrás do Juiz e começou a calcular os
ângulos, como fazer com que ele entrasse lá. Não fazia
nenhum sentido, mas ela parecia ter uma boa ideia do
que estavam fazendo e qualquer coisa era melhor que
continuar na Fábrica agora, com pessoas mortas por
todos os lados. Pensou em Gentry, lá em cima
com seus livros e aqueles corpos. Havia duas garotas lá
em cima, e as duas pareciam Angie Mitchell.
Agora uma delas estava morta, ele não sabia como ou
por quê, e a mulher com a arma tinha dito à
outra para esperar...
– Vamos lá, vamos lá, coloca essa coisa para dentro,
temos que ir...Quando ele conseguiu fazer o Juiz entrar na traseira do
hover, as pernas dobradas, de lado, bateu as portas com
força, deu a volta e sentou-se no lado do passageiro. O
aleph estava entre os bancos dianteiros. Cherry estava
encolhida no banco de trás, debaixo de uma grande
parca laranja com o logo da Sense/Net na manga,
tremendo.
A mulher ligou a turbina e inflou a saia. Slick pensou que
pudessem estar presos na pilha de escombros, mas
quando ela deu marcha à ré, o hover rasgou uma tira de
cromo e estavam livres. Ela rodou o hover e dirigiu-se
para os portões.
Enquanto saíam, passaram por um cara de terno e
gravata e um sobretudo de tweed, que não pareceu vê-
los. – Quem é aquele?
Ela encolheu os ombros.
***
– Você quer este hover? – perguntou. Eles talvez
estivessem a dez quilômetros da Fábrica agora,
e ele não havia olhado para trás.
– Você o roubou?
– Claro.
– Então deixa pra lá.
– Mesmo?
– Eu cumpri pena, roubo de carros.
– Então, como está sua namorada?– Dormindo. Ela não é minha namorada.
– Não?
– Posso perguntar quem você é?
– Uma mulher de negócios.
– Que tipo de negócios?
– Difícil dizer.
O céu sobre Solitude estava claro e branco.
– Você veio por causa disso? – Ele apontou para o aleph.
– Meio que sim.
– E agora?
– Fiz um trato. Juntei Mitchell à caixa.
– Foi ela, a que caiu?
– Sim, foi.
– Mas ela morreu...
– Há mortes e mortes.
– Como 3Jane?
A cabeça dela se mexeu, como se olhasse para ele. – O
que você sabe sobre isso?
– Eu a vi, uma vez. Lá dentro.
– Bem, ela ainda está lá, mas Angie também está.– E Bobby.
– Newmark? Sim.
– E o que você vai fazer com isso?
– Você construiu aquelas coisas, certo? Aquele na
traseira, os outros?
Slick olhou para trás, por sobre o ombro, para onde o Juiz
estava dobrado no compartimento de
carga do hover, como uma boneca sem cabeça, grande e
enferrujada. – Sim.
– Então você é bom com ferramentas.
– Acho que sim.
– Ok. Tenho um trabalho para você. – Ela desacelerou o
hover quando passavam ao lado de uma
pilha de ferro-velho coberta de neve e estacionou. – Deve
haver um kit de emergência aqui, em algum lugar.
Pegue-o, leve para o teto, traga as células solares e
alguns fios. Quero que você plugue as células, de modo
que elas recarreguem a bateria desta coisa. Você pode
fazer isso?
– Provavelmente. Por quê?
Ela afundou no banco e Slick viu que era mais velha do
que ele imaginava, e que estava cansada.
– Mitchell está lá, agora. Eles querem que ela tenha
algum tempo, é tudo...
– Eles?– Não sei. Algo. Seja lá com quem eu fiz o acordo. Por
quanto tempo você calcula que a bateria
vai aguentar, se as células funcionarem?
– Uns dois meses. Um ano, talvez.
– Ok. Vou escondê-lo em algum lugar, onde as células
possam pegar sol.
– O que acontece se você apenas cortar a força?
Ela estendeu a mão e correu a ponta de seu dedo
indicador ao longo do cabo grosso que conectava o aleph
à bateria. Slick viu suas unhas na luz da manhã;
pareciam artificiais. – Ei, 3Jane –
disse ela, seu dedo balançando sobre o cabo –, te peguei.
– Então sua mão era um punho cerrado, que se abriu,
como se estivesse soltando alguma coisa.
***
Cherry queria dizer para Slick tudo o que iriam fazer
quando chegassem a Cleveland. Ele estava
prendendo duas das células planas ao peito largo do Juiz
com fita adesiva prateada. O aleph cinza já estava preso
às costas da máquina com um arnês de fita adesiva.
Cherry disse que sabia onde ela iria conseguir um
trabalho para ele, consertando jogos em um fliperama.
Ele não estava escutando de fato.
Quando conseguiu ajustar tudo, entregou a unidade de
controle à mulher.
– Acho que vamos esperar por você agora.– Não – disse ela. – Vão para Cleveland. Cherry acabou de
te dizer isso.
– E quanto a você?
– Vou dar uma caminhada.
– Quer congelar? Talvez queira morrer de fome?
– Eu quero é ficar sozinha só para variar. – Ela testou os
controles e o Juiz tremeu, deu um passo à frente, depois
outro. – Boa sorte em Cleveland. – Eles observaram
enquanto ela caminhava
por Solitude, o Juiz se arrastando atrás dela. Então ela se
virou e gritou – Ei, Cherry! Leva esse cara para tomar um
banho!
Cherry acenou, os zíperes das suas jaquetas de couro
tinindo.

COURO VERMELHO
Petal disse que suas malas estavam aguardando no
Jaguar. – Você não vai querer voltar a Notting
Hill – disse ele –, então preparamos um lugar para você
em Camden Town.
– Petal – disse ela –, tenho que saber o que aconteceu
com Sally.
Ele ligou o motor.
– Swain a
sequestrar...
estava
chantageando.
Forçando-a
a– Ah. Pois bem – interrompeu ele –, eu entendo. Eu não
me preocuparia, se eu fosse você.
– Estou preocupada.
– Sally, posso dizer, conseguiu se ver livre daquele
pequeno problema. Além disso, de acordo
com alguns amigos nossos em postos oficiais, ela
conseguiu fazer com que todos os seus registros
evaporassem, aparentemente, exceto o controle
acionário de um cassino alemão. E se alguma coisa
aconteceu com Angela Mitchell, a Sense/Net não veio a
público. Tudo isso já está resolvido, agora.
– Vou vê-la de novo?
– Não na minha área. Por favor.
Afastaram-se do meio-fio.
– Petal – disse ela, enquanto dirigiam através de Londres
–, meu pai me disse que Swain...
– Tolo. Maldito tolo. Prefiro não falar sobre isso agora.
– Desculpe.
O aquecimento estava funcionando. Estava quente
dentro do Jaguar, e Kumiko estava muito cansada agora.
Recostou-se no couro vermelho e fechou os olhos. De
algum modo, pensou, seu encontro com 3Jane libertou-a
da vergonha, e a resposta de seu pai libertou-a de sua
raiva. 3Jane tinha sido muito cruel. Agora ela via a
crueldade de sua mãe, também. Mas tudo deve serperdoado, um dia, pensou, e adormeceu a caminho de
um lugar chamado Camden Town.

PEDRA LISA MAIS ADIANTE
Passaram a morar naquela casa: paredes de pedra cinza,
telhado em cerâmica, numa estação em
princípios do verão. Os terrenos eram brilhantes e
selvagens, embora a grama alta não crescesse e as
flores silvestres não murchassem.
Atrás da casa havia outras construções, fechadas,
inexploradas, e um campo onde planadores, presos por
fios, balançavam contra o vento.
Uma vez, caminhando sozinha entre os carvalhos na
extremidade daquele campo, ela viu três estranhos,
montados em alguma coisa que lembrava um cavalo.
Cavalos estão extintos, sua linhagem
terminada muitos anos antes que Angie nascesse. Uma
figura esbelta, num casaco de tweed, estava na sela, um
garoto que parecia um cavalariço de alguma pintura
antiga. À frente dele, uma garota japonesa, cavalgando a
coisa equina, enquanto atrás vinha um homenzinho
pálido, com cara oleosa,
num terno cinza, meias rosa e tornozelos brancos que
apareciam sobre seus sapatos marrons. Será que a
garota a tinha visto, retribuindo o olhar?
Ela se esqueceu de mencionar isso a Bobby.Seus visitantes mais frequentes chegam nos sonhos do
amanhecer, embora, uma vez, um
homenzinho que parecia um duende se anunciasse,
batendo repetidamente na pesada porta de carvalho,
exigindo ver, quando ela correu para abri-la, “aquele
merdinha do Newmark”. Bobby apresentou a tal criatura
como o Finlandês e pareceu muito feliz em vê-lo. A
jaqueta decrépita do Fin exalava um odor complexo de
fumaça, solda antiga e anchova em conserva. Bobby
explicou que o Fin sempre era bem-vindo.
– Melhor que seja. Não tem como segurá-lo lá fora, uma
vez que ele queira entrar.
3Jane aparecia também, uma das visitantes
madrugada, sua presença triste e indecisa. Bobby
da
mal parecia dar-se conta da presença dela, mas Angie, a
guardiã de tantas de suas memórias, reverberava sua
mistura de desejo, inveja, frustração e raiva. Angie
começou a entender as razões de 3Jane e a perdoá-la –
embora o quê, exatamente, vagando entre os carvalhos
à luz do sol, havia para ser perdoado?
Mas os sonhos de 3Jane às vezes cansavam Angie; ela
preferia outros sonhos, particularmente
aqueles de sua jovem protegida. Estes, geralmente,
como o vento movendo as cortinas debruadas, com os
primeiros cantos dos pássaros. Nessas ocasiões ela
chega para mais perto de Bobby, fecha os olhos,
mentaliza o nome Continuidade e aguarda pelas
pequenas imagens brilhantes.
Ela vê que levaram a garota para uma clínica na Jamaica,
para tratar seu vício por estimulantesnão refinados. Seu metabolismo finamente ajustado por
um paciente exército de médicos da Net, ela emerge
finalmente, radiando saúde. Com seu sensorium
modulado por Piper Hill, seus primeiros stims são
recebidos com um entusiasmo sem precedentes. Sua
audiência global está hipnotizada com
seu frescor, seu vigor, o modo deliciosamente ingênuo
com o qual parece descobrir sua vida glamourosa como
se fosse a primeira vez.
Uma sombra às vezes cruza a tela distante, mas somente
por um instante: Robin Lanier foi encontrado
estrangulado, congelado, na fachada em forma de
montanha do New Suzuki Envoy; tanto
Angie quanto Continuidade sabem a quem pertencem as
mãos compridas e fortes que estrangularam
o astro e o jogaram lá.
Contudo, uma certa coisa lhe escapa, um fragmento
especial do quebra-cabeças que é a história.
No canto da sombra do carvalho, debaixo de um pôr do
sol de metal e salmão, nesta França que
não é França, ela pergunta a Bobby a resposta para a sua
questão final.
***
Eles aguardaram na estradinha de acesso à meia-noite,
porque Bobby havia lhe prometido uma
resposta.Quando os relógios da casa bateram doze horas, ela
ouviu o barulho dos pneus sobre o cascalho. O carro era
longo, baixo e cinza.
Seu motorista era o Fin.
Bobby abriu a porta e ajudou-a a entrar.
No banco de trás estava sentado um jovem que ela
reconheceu de sua visão do cavalo impossível e seus três
cavaleiros díspares. Sorriu para ela, mas não disse nada.
– Este é Colin – disse Bobby, sentando-se ao lado dela. –
E você conhece o Fin.
– Ela nunca descobriu, não é? – perguntou Fin, engatando
a marcha.
– Não – disse Bobby –, acho que não.
O jovem chamado Colin estava sorrindo para ela. – O
aleph é uma aproximação da matrix –
disse ele –, um tipo de modelo do ciberespaço...
– Sim, eu sei. – Ela se virou para Bobby. – Bem? Você
prometeu que me contaria o porquê de
Quando Isso Mudou.
Fin riu, um som muito estranho. – Não é um porquê,
moça. Mais como um o quê. Lembra uma
vez, quando Brigitte te contou que havia este outro?
Certo? Bem, este é o quê, e o quê é o porquê.
– Sim, eu lembro. Ela disse que quando a matrix
finalmente conhecesse a si mesma, havia o outro...– É para onde estamos indo hoje à noite – começou
Bobby, colocando seu braço ao redor dela. –
Não é longe, mas é...
– Diferente – disse Fin. – É realmente diferente.
– Mas o que é?
– Entenda – disse Colin, escovando para o lado o seu
topete castanho, um gesto igual a de um
colegial em alguma peça de teatro antigo –, quando a
matrix se tornou um senciente, simultaneamente
percebeu a existência de outra matrix, de outro
senciente.
– Eu não entendo – disse ela. – Se o ciberespaço consiste
na soma total de dados do sistema humano...
– Sim – disse o Fin, virando-se para a autoestrada longa,
reta e deserta –, mas ninguém está falando em humanos,
entende?
– O outro era em algum outro lugar – disse Bobby.
– Centauri – disse Colin.
Estavam brincando com ela? Era alguma piada de
Bobby?
– Então é meio difícil de explicar por que a matrix dividiu-
se naqueles vodus e tudo mais, quando ela encontrou
essa outra – disse o Fin –, mas quando chegarmos lá,
você meio que vai pegar a ideia...
– Minha sensação – disse Colin – é que tudo é tão mais
divertido, deste jeito...– Vocês estão me dizendo a verdade?
– Chegaremos lá em um minuto nova-iorquino – disse o
Fin. – Sem brincadeira.
