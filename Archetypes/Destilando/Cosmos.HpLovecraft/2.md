visually. I recalled what he had
said of the pineal gland, and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye.
Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight. Over and above the
luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which, though vague, held the elements of
consistency and permanence. It was indeed somewhat familiar, for the unusual part was
superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon
the painted curtain of a theatre. I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the
unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material
objects not one particle was vacant. Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were
mixed in disgusting disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien,
unknown entities. It likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of
other unknown things, and vice versa. Foremost among the living objects were great inky,
jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine.
They were present in loathsome profusion, and I saw to my horror that they overlapped; that
they were semi-fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know
as solids. These things were never still, but seemed ever floating about with some malignant
purpose. Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the attacker launching itself at its
victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight. Shudderingly I felt that I knew
what had obliterated the unfortunate servants, and could not exclude the things from my mind
as I strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us.
But Tillinghast had been watching me, and was speaking.
―You see them? You see them? You see the things that float and flop about you and through
you every moment of your life? You see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and
the blue sky? Have I not succeeded in breaking down the barrier; have I not shewn you
worlds that no other living men have seen?‖ I heard him scream through the horrible chaos,
and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine. His eyes were pits of flame,
and they glared at me with what I now saw was overwhelming hatred. The machine droned
detestably.
―You think those floundering things wiped out the servants? Fool, they are harmless! But the
servants are gone, aren‘t they? You tried to stop me; you discouraged me when I needed
every drop of encouragement I could get; you were afraid of the cosmic truth, you damned
coward, but now I‘ve got you! What swept up the servants? What made them scream so
loud? . . . Don‘t know, eh? You‘ll know soon enough! Look at me—listen to what I say—do you
suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude? Do you fancy there are
such things as form or matter? I tell you, I have struck depths that your little brain can‘t
picture! I have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down daemons from the stars. . .
. I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness. . .
. Space belongs to me, do you hear? Things are hunting me now—the things that devour and
dissolve—but I know how to elude them. It is you they will get, as they got the servants.
Stirring, dear sir? I told you it was dangerous to move. I have saved you so far by telling you
to keep still—saved you to see more sights and to listen to me. If you had moved, they would
have been at you long ago. Don‘t worry, they won‘t hurt you. They didn‘t hurt the servants—it
was seeing that made the poor devils scream so. My pets are not pretty, for they come out of
places where aesthetic standards are—very different. Disintegration is quite painless, I assure
you—but I want you to see them. I almost saw them, but I knew how to stop. You are not
curious? I always knew you were no scientist! Trembling, eh? Trembling with anxiety to see
the ultimate things I have discovered? Why don‘t you move, then? Tired? Well, don‘t worry,
my friend, for they are coming. . . . Look! Look, curse you, look! . . . It‘s just over your left
shoulder. . . .‖
What remains to be told is very brief, and may be familiar to you from the newspaper
accounts. The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast house and found us there—Tillinghast
dead and me unconscious. They arrested me because the revolver was in my hand, but
released me in three hours, after they found it was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast
and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly
shattered on the laboratory floor. I did not tell very much of what I had seen, for I feared the
coroner would be sceptical; but from the evasive outline I did give, the doctor told me that I
had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and homicidal madman.
I wish I could believe that doctor. It would help my shaky nerves if I could dismiss what I now
have to think of the air and the sky about and above me. I never feel alone or comfortable,
and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when I am weary. What
prevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple fact—that the police never found the
bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford Tillinghast murdered.

Nyarlathotep
(1920)
Nyarlathotep . . . the crawling chaos . . . I am the last . . . I will tell the audient void. . . .
I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The general tension was
horrible. To a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding
apprehension of hideous physical danger; a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a
danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night. I recall that the
people went about with pale and worried faces, and whispered warnings and prophecies
which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard. A sense
of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill
currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places. There was a daemoniac alteration in
the sequence of the seasons—the autumn heat lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that
the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to
that of gods or forces which were unknown.
And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could tell, but he was
of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet
could not say why. He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries,
and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation
came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass
and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the
sciences—of electricity and psychology—and gave exhibitions of power which sent his
spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men
advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest
vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare. Never before had the
screams of nightmare been such a public problem; now the wise men almost wished they
could forbid sleep in the small hours, that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the
pale, pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges, and old steeples
crumbling against a sickly sky.
I remember when Nyarlathotep came to my city—the great, the old, the terrible city of
unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and of the impelling fascination and
allurement of his revelations, and I burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries.
My friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; that
what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but Nyarlathotep
dared prophesy, and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had
never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes. And I heard it hinted abroad that
those who knew Nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not.
It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless crowds to see
Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room. And
shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from
behind fallen monuments. And I saw the world battling against blackness; against the waves
of destruction from ultimate space; whirling, churning; struggling around the dimming, cooling
sun. Then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators, and hair stood up
on end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can tell came out and squatted on the heads.
And when I, who was colder and more scientific than the rest, mumbled a trembling protest
about ―imposture‖ and ―static electricity‖, Nyarlathotep drave us all out, down the dizzy stairs
into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I screamed aloud that I was not afraid; that I
never could be afraid; and others screamed with me for solace. We sware to one another that
the city was exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to fade we
cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces we made.
I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we began to
depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary formations and seemed to know our
destinations though we dared not think of them. Once we looked at the pavement and found
the blocks loose and displaced by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the
tramways had run. And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost
on its side. When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the river,
and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top. Then we split up
into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a different direction. One disappeared
in a narrow alley to the left, leaving only the echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down a
weed-choked subway entrance, howling with a laughter that was mad. My own column was
sucked toward the open country, and presently felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn; for
as we stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld around us the hellish moon-glitter of evil
snows. Trackless, inexplicable snows, swept asunder in one direction only, where lay a gulf all
the blacker for its glittering walls. The column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily
into the gulf. I lingered behind, for the black rift in the green-litten snow was frightful, and I
thought I had heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but
my power to linger was slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I half floated
between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the sightless vortex of the
unimaginable.
Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can tell. A sickened, sensitive
shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of
rotting creation, corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush
the pallid stars and make them flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous
things; half-seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space
and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness. And through this
revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin,
monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond
Time; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly
the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods—the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is
Nyarlathotep.

The Picture in the House
(1920)
Searchers after horror haunt strange, far places. For them are the catacombs of Ptolemais,
and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries. They climb to the moonlit towers of
ruined Rhine castles, and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of
forgotten cities in Asia. The haunted wood and the desolate mountain are their shrines, and
they linger around the sinister monoliths on uninhabited islands. But the true epicure in the
terrible, to whom a new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of
existence, esteems most of all the ancient, lonely farmhouses of backwoods New England;
for there the dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness, and ignorance combine to
form the perfection of the hideous.
Most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses remote from travelled ways,
usually squatted upon some damp, grassy slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping
of rock. Two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines
have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread. They are almost hidden now in lawless
luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow; but the small-paned windows still stare
shockingly, as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the
memory of unutterable things.
In such houses have dwelt generations of strange people, whose like the world has never
seen. Seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind, their
ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom. There the scions of a conquering race indeed
flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows, but cowered in an appalling slavery to the
dismal phantasms of their own minds. Divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation, the
strength of these Puritans turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self-
repression, and struggle for life with relentless Nature, there came to them dark furtive traits
from the prehistoric depths of their cold Northern heritage. By necessity practical and by
philosophy stern, these folk were not beautiful in their sins. Erring as all mortals must, they
were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that they came to use
less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the
backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not
communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes
one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream.
It was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven one afternoon in
November, 1896, by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to
exposure. I had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in
quest of certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of
my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season.
Now I found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest
cut to Arkham; overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and confronted with no
refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows
from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill. Distant though it was from
the remnant of a road, the house none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment
I espied it. Honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly,
and in my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which
biassed me against places of this kind. Yet the force of the elements was such as to
overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the
closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive.
I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I approached it I
was not so sure; for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds, they seemed to
retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion. Therefore instead of trying the
door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain. As I waited on the
rough, mossy rock which served as a doorstep, I glanced at the neighbouring windows and
the panes of the transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost
opaque with dirt, they were not broken. The building, then, must still be inhabited, despite its
isolation and general neglect. However, my rapping evoked no response, so after repeating
the summons I tried the rusty latch and found the door unfastened. Inside was a little
vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through the doorway came a faint
but peculiarly hateful odour. I entered, carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me.
Ahead rose a narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to
the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor.
Leaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low-
ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and
most primitive possible way. It appeared to be a kind of sitting-room, for it had a table and
several chairs, and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel.
Books and papers were very few, and in the prevailing gloom I could not readily discern the
titles. What interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible detail.
Most of the houses in this region I had found rich in relics of the past, but here the antiquity
was curiously complete; for in all the room I could not discover a single article of definitely
post-revolutionary date. Had the furnishings been less humble, the place would have been a
collector‘s paradise.
As I surveyed this quaint apartment, I felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the
bleak exterior of the house. Just what it was that I feared or loathed, I could by no means
define; but something in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age, of
unpleasant crudeness, and of secrets which should be forgotten. I felt disinclined to sit down,
and wandered about examining the various articles which I had noticed. The first object of my
curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an antediluvian
aspect that I marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library. It was bound in leather
with metal fittings, and was in an excellent state of preservation; being altogether an unusual
sort of volume to encounter in an abode so lowly. When I opened it to the title page my
wonder grew even greater, for it proved to be nothing less rare than Pigafetta‘s account of the
Congo region, written in Latin from the notes of the sailor Lopez and printed at Frankfort in
1598. I had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers De Bry, hence
for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me. The engravings
were indeed interesting, drawn wholly from imagination and careless descriptions, and
represented negroes with white skins and Caucasian features; nor would I soon have closed
the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired nerves and revived my
sensation of disquiet. What annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the volume
tended to fall open of itself at Plate XII, which represented in gruesome detail a butcher‘s
shop of the cannibal Anziques. I experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so slight a
thing, but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me, especially in connexion with some adjacent
passages descriptive of Anzique gastronomy.
I had turned to a neighbouring shelf and was examining its meagre literary contents—an
eighteenth-century Bible, a Pilgrim’s Progress of like period, illustrated with grotesque
woodcuts and printed by the almanack-maker Isaiah Thomas, the rotting bulk of Cotton
Mather‘s Magnalia Christi Americana, and a few other books of evidently equal age—when
my attention was aroused by the unmistakable sound of walking in the room overhead. At first
astonished and startled, considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door, I
immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a sound sleep; and
listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the creaking stairs. The tread was
heavy, yet seemed to contain a curious quality of cautiousness; a quality which I disliked the
more because the tread was heavy. When I had entered the room I had shut the door behind
me. Now, after a moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my
bicycle in the hall, I heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the panelled portal swing open
again.
In the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should have exclaimed
aloud but for the restraints of good breeding. Old, white-bearded, and ragged, my host
possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect. His height
could not have been less than six feet, and despite a general air of age and poverty he was
stout and powerful in proportion. His face, almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on
the cheeks, seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect; while over a
high forehead fell a shock of white hair little thinned by the years. His blue eyes, though a
trifle bloodshot, seemed inexplicably keen and burning. But for his horrible unkemptness the
man would have been as distinguished-looking as he was impressive. This unkemptness,
however, made him offensive despite his face and figure. Of what his clothing consisted I
could hardly tell, for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters surmounting a pair of
high, heavy boots; and his lack of cleanliness surpassed description.
The appearance of this man, and the instinctive fear he inspired, prepared me for something
like enmity; so that I almost shuddered through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity
when he motioned me to a chair and addressed me in a thin, weak voice full of fawning
respect and ingratiating hospitality. His speech was very curious, an extreme form of Yankee
dialect I had thought long extinct; and I studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for
conversation.
―Ketched in the rain, be ye?‖ he greeted. ―Glad ye was nigh the haouse en‘ hed the sense ta
come right in. I calc‘late I was asleep, else I‘d a heerd ye—I ain‘t as young as I uster be, an‘ I
need a paowerful sight o‘ naps naowadays. Trav‘lin‘ fur? I hain‘t seed many folks ‘long this rud
sence they tuk off the Arkham stage.‖
I replied that I was going to Arkham, and apologised for my rude entry into his domicile,
whereupon he continued.
―Glad ta see ye, young Sir—new faces is scurce arount here, an‘ I hain‘t got much ta cheer
me up these days. Guess yew hail from Bosting, don‘t ye? I never ben thar, but I kin tell a
taown man when I see ‘im—we hed one fer deestrick schoolmaster in ‘eighty-four, but he quit
suddent an‘ no one never heerd on ‘im sence—‖ Here the old man lapsed into a kind of
chuckle, and made no explanation when I questioned him. He seemed to be in an
aboundingly good humour, yet to possess those eccentricities which one might guess from his
grooming. For some time he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality, when it struck me
to ask him how he came by so rare a book as Pigafetta‘s Regnum Congo. The effect of this
volume had not left me, and I felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it; but curiosity
overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of
the house. To my relief, the question did not seem an awkward one; for the old man answered
freely and volubly.
―Oh, thet Afriky book? Cap‘n Ebenezer Holt traded me thet in ‘sixty-eight—him as was kilt in
the war.‖ Something about the name of Ebenezer Holt caused me to look up sharply. I had
encountered it in my genealogical work, but not in any record since the Revolution. I
wondered if my host could help me in the task at which I was labouring, and resolved to ask
him about it later on. He continued.
―Ebenezer was on a Salem merchantman for years, an‘ picked up a sight o‘ queer stuff in
every port. He got this in London, I guess—he uster like ter buy things at the shops. I was up
ta his haouse onct, on the hill, tradin‘ hosses, when I see this book. I relished the picters, so
he give it in on a swap. ‘Tis a queer book—here, leave me git on my spectacles—‖ The old
man fumbled among his rags, producing a pair of dirty and amazingly antique glasses with
small octagonal lenses and steel bows. Donning these, he reached for the volume on the
table and turned the pages lovingly.
―Ebenezer cud read a leetle o‘ this—‘tis Latin—but I can‘t. I hed two er three schoolmasters
read me a bit, and Passon Clark, him they say got draownded in the pond—kin yew make
anything outen it?‖ I told him that I could, and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the
beginning. If I erred, he was not scholar enough to correct me; for he seemed childishly
pleased at my English version. His proximity was becoming rather obnoxious, yet I saw no
way to escape without offending him. I was amused at the childish fondness of this ignorant
old man for the pictures in a book he could not read, and wondered how much better he could
read the few books in English which adorned the room. This revelation of simplicity removed
much of the ill-defined apprehension I had felt, and I smiled as my host rambled on:
―Queer haow picters kin set a body thinkin‘. Take this un here near the front. Hev yew ever
seed trees like thet, with big leaves a-floppin‘ over an‘ daown? And them men—them can‘t be
niggers—they dew beat all. Kinder like Injuns, I guess, even ef they be in Afriky. Some o‘
these here critters looks like monkeys, or half monkeys an‘ half men, but I never heerd o‘
nothing like this un.‖ Here he pointed to a fabulous creature of the artist, which one might
describe as a sort of dragon with the head of an alligator.
―But naow I‘ll shew ye the best un—over here nigh the middle—‖ The old man‘s speech grew
a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter glow; but his fumbling hands, though
seemingly clumsier than before, were entirely adequate to their mission. The book fell open,
almost of its own accord and as if from frequent consultation at this place, to the repellent
twelfth plate shewing a butcher‘s shop amongst the Anzique cannibals. My sense of
restlessness returned, though I did not exhibit it. The especially bizarre thing was that the
artist had made his Africans look like white men—the limbs and quarters hanging about the
walls of the shop were ghastly, while the butcher with his axe was hideously incongruous. But
my host seemed to relish the view as much as I disliked it.
―What d‘ye think o‘ this—ain‘t never see the like hereabouts, eh? When I see this I telled Eb
Holt, ‗That‘s suthin‘ ta stir ye up an‘ make yer blood tickle!‘ When I read in Scripter about
slayin‘—like them Midianites was slew—I kinder think things, but I ain‘t got no picter of it. Here
a body kin see all they is to it—I s‘pose ‘tis sinful, but ain‘t we all born an‘ livin‘ in sin?—Thet
feller bein‘ chopped up gives me a tickle every time I look at ‘im—I hev ta keep lookin‘ at ‘im—
see whar the butcher cut off his feet? Thar‘s his head on thet bench, with one arm side of it,
an‘ t‘other arm‘s on the graound side o‘ the meat block.‖
As the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his hairy, spectacled face
became indescribable, but his voice sank rather than mounted. My own sensations can
scarcely be recorded. All the terror I had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly,
and I knew that I loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite
intensity. His madness, or at least his partial perversion, seemed beyond dispute. He was
almost whispering now, with a huskiness more terrible than a scream, and I trembled as I
listened.
―As I says, ‘tis queer haow picters sets ye thinkin‘. D‘ye know, young Sir, I‘m right sot on this
un here. Arter I got the book off Eb I uster look at it a lot, especial when I‘d heerd Passon
Clark rant o‘ Sundays in his big wig. Onct I tried suthin‘ funny—here, young Sir, don‘t git
skeert—all I done was ter look at the picter afore I kilt the sheep for market—killin‘ sheep was
kinder more fun arter lookin‘ at it—‖ The tone of the old man now sank very low, sometimes
becoming so faint that his words were hardly audible. I listened to the rain, and to the rattling
of the bleared, small-paned windows, and marked a rumbling of approaching thunder quite
unusual for the season. Once a terrific flash and peal shook the frail house to its foundations,
but the whisperer seemed not to notice it.
―Killin‘ sheep was kinder more fun—but d‘ye know, ‘twan‘t quite satisfyin’. Queer haow a
cravin’ gits a holt on ye— As ye love the Almighty, young man, don‘t tell nobody, but I swar ter
Gawd thet picter begun ta make me hungry fer victuals I couldn’t raise nor buy—here, set still,
what‘s ailin‘ ye?—I didn‘t do nothin‘, only I wondered haow ‘twud be ef I did— They say meat
makes blood an‘ flesh, an‘ gives ye new life, so I wondered ef ‘twudn‘t make a man live longer
an‘ longer ef ‘twas more the same—‖ But the whisperer never continued. The interruption was
not produced by my fright, nor by the rapidly increasing storm amidst whose fury I was
presently to open my eyes on a smoky solitude of blackened ruins. It was produced by a very
simple though somewhat unusual happening.
The open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward. As the old man
whispered the words ―more the same” a tiny spattering impact was heard, and something
shewed on the yellowed paper of the upturned volume. I thought of the rain and of a leaky
roof, but rain is not red. On the butcher‘s shop of the Anzique cannibals a small red spattering
glistened picturesquely, lending vividness to the horror of the engraving. The old man saw it,
and stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it necessary; saw it and
glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he had left an hour before. I followed his glance,
and beheld just above us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of
wet crimson which seemed to spread even as I viewed it. I did not shriek or move, but merely
shut my eyes. A moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that
accursed house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my mind.

Ex Oblivione
(1921)
When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to
madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their
victim‘s body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I
had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.
Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and
languorously under strange stars.
Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I
reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.
And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended
in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.
Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral
half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground
stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of
buried temples. And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the
little gate of bronze therein.
After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and
sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and
wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl
back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in
the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered,
there would be no return.
So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall,
though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall
was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.
Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the
thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born
in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and
among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall
pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I
had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.
Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but
others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and
more to cross forever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and
no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I
learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it
when next I awaked.
Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy
groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was
ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the
buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I
should never return.
But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew
that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but
only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared
hoped to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the
daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.

The Nameless City
(1921)
When I drew nigh the nameless city I knew it was accursed. I was travelling in a parched and
terrible valley under the moon, and afar I saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts
of a corpse may protrude from an ill-made grave. Fear spoke from the age-worn stones of this
hoary survivor of the deluge, this great-grandmother of the eldest pyramid; and a viewless
aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should
see, and no man else had ever dared to see.
Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city, crumbling and inarticulate, its low walls
nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages. It must have been thus before the first stones
of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks of Babylon were yet unbaked. There is no legend
so old as to give it a name, or to recall that it was ever alive; but it is told of in whispers
around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks, so that all the tribes
shun it without wholly knowing why. It was of this place that Abdul Alhazred the mad poet
dreamed on the night before he sang his unexplainable couplet:
―That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.‖
I should have known that the Arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless city, the city
told of in strange tales but seen by no living man, yet I defied them and went into the
untrodden waste with my camel. I alone have seen it, and that is why no other face bears
such hideous lines of fear as mine; why no other man shivers so horribly when the night-wind
rattles the windows. When I came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep it looked at
me, chilly from the rays of a cold moon amidst the desert‘s heat. And as I returned its look I
forgot my triumph at finding it, and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn.
For hours I waited, till the east grew grey and the stars faded, and the grey turned to roseal
light edged with gold. I heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique
stones though the sky was clear and the vast reaches of the desert still. Then suddenly above
the desert‘s far rim came the blazing edge of the sun, seen through the tiny sandstorm which
was passing away, and in my fevered state I fancied that from some remote depth there came
a crash of musical metal to hail the fiery disc as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.
My ears rang and my imagination seethed as I led my camel slowly across the sand to that
unvocal stone place; that place too old for Egypt and Meroë to remember; that place which I
alone of living men had seen.
In and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and palaces I wandered, finding
never a carving or inscription to tell of those men, if men they were, who built the city and
dwelt therein so long ago. The antiquity of the spot was unwholesome, and I longed to
encounter some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by mankind. There
were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins which I did not like. I had with me many
tools, and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow, and
nothing significant was revealed. When night and the moon returned I felt a chill wind which
brought new fear, so that I did not dare to remain in the city. And as I went outside the antique
walls to sleep, a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stones
though the moon was bright and most of the desert still.
I awaked just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams, my ears ringing as from some
metallic peal. I saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a little sandstorm that
hovered over the nameless city, and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape. Once
more I ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under
a coverlet, and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race. At noon I rested, and in the
afternoon I spent much time tracing the walls, and the bygone streets, and the outlines of the
nearly vanished buildings. I saw that the city had been mighty indeed, and wondered at the
sources of its greatness. To myself I pictured all the splendours of an age so distant that
Chaldaea could not recall it, and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of
Mnar when mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before mankind
existed.
All at once I came upon a place where the bed-rock rose stark through the sand and formed a
low cliff; and here I saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian
people. Hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small,
squat rock houses or temples; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too
remote for calculation, though sandstorms had long since effaced any carvings which may
have been outside.
Very low and sand-choked were all of the dark apertures near me, but I cleared one with my
spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold.
When I was inside I saw that the cavern was indeed a temple, and beheld plain signs of the
race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert. Primitive altars, pillars,
and niches, all curiously low, were not absent; and though I saw no sculptures nor frescoes,
there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means. The lowness
of the chiselled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly more than kneel upright; but the
area was so great that my torch shewed only part at a time. I shuddered oddly in some of the
far corners; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible, revolting, and
inexplicable nature, and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and
frequented such a temple. When I had seen all that the place contained, I crawled out again,
avid to find what the other temples might yield.
Night had now approached, yet the tangible things I had seen made curiosity stronger than
fear, so that I did not flee from the long moon-cast shadows that had daunted me when first I
saw the nameless city. In the twilight I cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled
into it, finding more vague stones and symbols, though nothing more definite than the other
temple had contained. The room was just as low, but much less broad, ending in a very
narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines. About these shrines I was prying
when the noise of a wind and of my camel outside broke through the stillness and drew me
forth to see what could have frightened the beast.
The moon was gleaming vividly over the primeval ruins, lighting a dense cloud of sand that
seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead of me. I
knew it was this chilly, sandy wind which had disturbed the camel, and was about to lead him
to a place of better shelter when I chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop
the cliff. This astonished me and made me fearful again, but I immediately recalled the
sudden local winds I had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset, and judged it was a
normal thing. I decided that it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave, and watched
the troubled sand to trace it to its source; soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of
a temple a long distance south of me, almost out of sight. Against the choking sand-cloud I
plodded toward this temple, which as I neared it loomed larger than the rest, and shewed a
doorway far less clogged with caked sand. I would have entered had not the terrific force of
the icy wind almost quenched my torch. It poured madly out of the dark door, sighing
uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread about the weird ruins. Soon it grew fainter and the
sand grew more and more still, till finally all was at rest again; but a presence seemed stalking
among the spectral stones of the city, and when I glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as
though mirrored in unquiet waters. I was more afraid than I could explain, but not enough to
dull my thirst for wonder; so as soon as the wind was quite gone I crossed into the dark
chamber from which it had come.
This temple, as I had fancied from the outside, was larger than either of those I had visited
before; and was presumably a natural cavern, since it bore winds from some region beyond.
Here I could stand quite upright, but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in
the other temples. On the walls and roof I beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial
art of the ancient race, curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled
away; and on two of the altars I saw with rising excitement a maze of well-fashioned
curvilinear carvings. As I held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of the roof was
too regular to be natural, and I wondered what the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked
upon. Their engineering skill must have been vast.
Then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame shewed me that for which I had been seeking, the
opening to those remoter abysses whence the sudden wind had blown; and I grew faint when
I saw that it was a small and plainly artificial door chiselled in the solid rock. I thrust my torch
within, beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small,
numerous, and steeply descending steps. I shall always see those steps in my dreams, for I
came to learn what they meant. At the time I hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere
foot-holds in a precipitous descent. My mind was whirling with mad thoughts, and the words
and warnings of Arab prophets seemed to float across the desert from the lands that men
know to the nameless city that men dare not know. Yet I hesitated only a moment before
advancing through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep passage,
feet first, as though on a ladder.
It is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can have had such
a descent as mine. The narrow passage led infinitely down like some hideous haunted well,
and the torch I held above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which I was
crawling. I lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch, though I was frightened
when I thought of the distance I must be traversing. There were changes of direction and of
steepness, and once I came to a long, low, level passage where I had to wriggle feet first
along the rocky floor, holding my torch at arm‘s length beyond my head. The place was not
high enough for kneeling. After that were more of the steep steps, and I was still scrambling
down interminably when my failing torch died out. I do not think I noticed it at the time, for
when I did notice it I was still holding it high above me as if it were ablaze. I was quite
unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and the unknown which has made me a
wanderer upon earth and a haunter of far, ancient, and forbidden places.
In the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished treasury of
daemoniac lore; sentences from Alhazred the mad Arab, paragraphs from the apocryphal
nightmares of Damascius, and infamous lines from the delirious Image du Monde of Gauthier
de Metz. I repeated queer extracts, and muttered of Afrasiab and the daemons that floated
with him down the Oxus; later chanting over and over again a phrase from one of Lord
Dunsany‘s tales—―the unreverberate blackness of the abyss‖. Once when the descent grew
amazingly steep I recited something in sing-song from Thomas Moore until I feared to recite
more:
―A reservoir of darkness, black
As witches‘ cauldrons are, when fill‘d
With moon-drugs in th‘ eclipse distill‘d.
Leaning to look if foot might pass
Down thro‘ that chasm, I saw, beneath,
As far as vision could explore,
The jetty sides as smooth as glass,
Looking as if just varnish‘d o‘er
With that dark pitch the Sea of Death
Throws out upon its slimy shore.‖
Time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor, and I found myself in a
place slightly higher than the rooms in the two smaller temples now so incalculably far above
my head. I could not quite stand, but could kneel upright, and in the dark I shuffled and crept
hither and thither at random. I soon knew that I was in a narrow passage whose walls were
lined with cases of wood having glass fronts. As in that Palaeozoic and abysmal place I felt of
such things as polished wood and glass I shuddered at the possible implications. The cases
were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular intervals, and were oblong
and horizontal, hideously like coffins in shape and size. When I tried to move two or three for
further examination, I found they were firmly fastened.
I saw that the passage was a long one, so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping run that
would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in the blackness; crossing from side to
side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still
stretched on. Man is so used to thinking visually that I almost forgot the darkness and pictured
the endless corridor of wood and glass in its low-studded monotony as though I saw it. And
then in a moment of indescribable emotion I did see it.
Just when my fancy merged into real sight I cannot tell; but there came a gradual glow ahead,
and all at once I knew that I saw the dim outlines of the corridor and the cases, revealed by
some unknown subterranean phosphorescence. For a little while all was exactly as I had
imagined it, since the glow was very faint; but as I mechanically kept on stumbling ahead into
the stronger light I realised that my fancy had been but feeble. This hall was no relic of crudity
like the temples in the city above, but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art.
Rich, vivid, and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural
painting whose lines and colours were beyond description. The cases were of a strange
golden wood, with fronts of exquisite glass, and contained the mummified forms of creatures
outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of man.
To convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible. They were of the reptile kind, with
body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile, sometimes the seal, but more often nothing of
which either the naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard. In size they approximated a
small man, and their fore legs bore delicate and evidently flexible feet curiously like human
hands and fingers. But strangest of all were their heads, which presented a contour violating
all known biological principles. To nothing can such things be well compared—in one flash I
thought of comparisons as varied as the cat, the bulldog, the mythic Satyr, and the human
being. Not Jove himself had so colossal and protuberant a forehead, yet the horns and the
noselessness and the alligator-like jaw placed the things outside all established categories. I
debated for a time on the reality of the mummies, half suspecting they were artificial idols; but
soon decided they were indeed some palaeogean species which had lived when the
nameless city was alive. To crown their grotesqueness, most of them were gorgeously
enrobed in the costliest of fabrics, and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold, jewels, and
unknown shining metals.
The importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast, for they held first place
among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling. With matchless skill had the artist
drawn them in a world of their own, wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit
their dimensions; and I could not but think that their pictured history was allegorical, perhaps
shewing the progress of the race that worshipped them. These creatures, I said to myself,
were to the men of the nameless city what the she-wolf was to Rome, or some totem-beast is
to a tribe of Indians.
Holding this view, I thought I could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city; the
tale of a mighty sea-coast metropolis that ruled the world before Africa rose out of the waves,
and of its struggles as the sea shrank away, and the desert crept into the fertile valley that
held it. I saw its wars and triumphs, its troubles and defeats, and afterward its terrible fight
against the desert when thousands of its people—here represented in allegory by the
grotesque reptiles—were driven to chisel their way down through the rocks in some
marvellous manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them. It was all vividly
weird and realistic, and its connexion with the awesome descent I had made was
unmistakable. I even recognised the passages.
As I crept along the corridor toward the brighter light I saw later stages of the painted epic—
the leave-taking of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and the valley around for ten
million years; the race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so
long, where they had settled as nomads in the earth‘s youth, hewing in the virgin rock those
primal shrines at which they never ceased to worship. Now that the light was better I studied
the pictures more closely, and, remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the
unknown men, pondered upon the customs of the nameless city. Many things were peculiar
and inexplicable. The civilisation, which included a written alphabet, had seemingly risen to a
higher order than those immeasurably later civilisations of Egypt and Chaldaea, yet there
were curious omissions. I could, for example, find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral
customs, save such as were related to wars, violence, and plagues; and I wondered at the
reticence shewn concerning natural death. It was as though an ideal of earthly immortality
had been fostered as a cheering illusion.
Still nearer the end of the passage were painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness and
extravagance; contrasted views of the nameless city in its desertion and growing ruin, and of
the strange new realm or paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone. In
these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by moonlight, a golden nimbus
hovering over the fallen walls and half revealing the splendid perfection of former times,
shewn spectrally and elusively by the artist. The paradisal scenes were almost too
extravagant to be believed; portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled with glorious cities
and ethereal hills and valleys. At the very last I thought I saw signs of an artistic anti-climax.
The paintings were less skilful, and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier
scenes. They seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock, coupled with a
growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert. The forms of
the people—always represented by the sacred reptiles—appeared to be gradually wasting
away, though their spirit as shewn hovering about the ruins by moonlight gained in proportion.
Emaciated priests, displayed as reptiles in ornate robes, cursed the upper air and all who
breathed it; and one terrible final scene shewed a primitive-looking man, perhaps a pioneer of
ancient Irem, the City of Pillars, torn to pieces by members of the elder race. I remembered
how the Arabs fear the nameless city, and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and
ceiling were bare.
As I viewed the pageant of mural history I had approached very closely the end of the low-
ceiled hall, and was aware of a great gate through which came all of the illuminating
phosphorescence. Creeping up to it, I cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay
beyond; for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of
uniform radiance, such as one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of Mount
Everest upon a sea of sunlit mist. Behind me was a passage so cramped that I could not
stand upright in it; before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgence.
Reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of steps—
small numerous steps like those of the black passages I had traversed—but after a few feet
the glowing vapours concealed everything. Swung back open against the left-hand wall of the
passage was a massive door of brass, incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic bas-
reliefs, which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and
passages of rock. I looked at the steps, and for the nonce dared not try them. I touched the
open brass door, and could not move it. Then I sank prone to the stone floor, my mind aflame
with prodigious reflections which not even a death-like exhaustion could banish.
As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had lightly noted in the frescoes
came back to me with new and terrible significance—scenes representing the nameless city
in its heyday, the vegetation of the valley around it, and the distant lands with which its
merchants traded. The allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal
prominence, and I wondered that it should be so closely followed in a pictured history of such
importance. In the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the
reptiles. I wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been, and reflected a
moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the ruins. I thought curiously of the lowness of the
primal temples and of the underground corridor, which were doubtless hewn thus out of
deference to the reptile deities there honoured; though it perforce reduced the worshippers to
crawling. Perhaps the very rites had involved a crawling in imitation of the creatures. No
religious theory, however, could easily explain why the level passage in that awesome
descent should be as low as the temples—or lower, since one could not even kneel in it. As I
thought of the crawling creatures, whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me, I felt
a new throb of fear. Mental associations are curious, and I shrank from the idea that except
for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting, mine was the only human form
amidst the many relics and symbols of primordial life.
But as always in my strange and roving existence, wonder soon drove out fear; for the
luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of the greatest
explorer. That a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps I could
not doubt, and I hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted corridor had
failed to give. The frescoes had pictured unbelievable cities, hills, and valleys in this lower
realm, and my fancy dwelt on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited me.
My fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future. Not even the physical horror of
my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below
the world I knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal
dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul. An ancientness so vast that
measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rock-hewn temples in
the nameless city, while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed
oceans and continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there some vaguely familiar
outline. Of what could have happened in the geological aeons since the paintings ceased and
the death-hating race resentfully succumbed to decay, no man might say. Life had once
teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with vivid relics,
and I trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent and
deserted vigil.
Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever
since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my
exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the
black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world. My sensations were much like
those which had made me shun the nameless city at night, and were as inexplicable as they
were poignant. In another moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a
definite sound—the first which had broken the utter silence of these tomb-like depths. It was a
deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of condemned spirits, and came from the direction
in which I was staring. Its volume rapidly grew, till soon it reverberated frightfully through the
low passage, and at the same time I became conscious of an increasing draught of cold air,
likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seemed to restore
my balance, for I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the
abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed served to reveal the hidden tunnels
to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near, so braced myself to resist the
gale which was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening. My fear
again waned low, since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknown.
More and more madly poured the shrieking, moaning night-wind into that gulf of the inner
earth. I dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of being swept bodily
through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss. Such fury I had not expected, and as I
grew aware of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss I was beset by a thousand new
terrors of apprehension and imagination. The malignancy of the blast awakened incredible
fancies; once more I compared myself shudderingly to the only other human image in that
frightful corridor, the man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race, for in the fiendish
clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive rage all the stronger
because it was largely impotent. I think I screamed frantically near the last—I was almost
mad—but if I did so my cries were lost in the hell-born babel of the howling wind-wraiths. I
tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent, but I could not even hold my own as I
was pushed slowly and inexorably toward the unknown world. Finally reason must have
wholly snapped, for I fell to babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad Arab
Alhazred, who dreamed of the nameless city:
―That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.‖
Only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took place—what indescribable
struggles and scrambles in the dark I endured or what Abaddon guided me back to life, where
I must always remember and shiver in the night-wind till oblivion—or worse—claims me.
Monstrous, unnatural, colossal, was the thing—too far beyond all the ideas of man to be
believed except in the silent damnable small hours when one cannot sleep.
I have said that the fury of the rushing blast was infernal—cacodaemoniacal—and that its
voices were hideous with the pent-up viciousness of desolate eternities. Presently those
voices, while still chaotic before me, seemed to my beating brain to take articulate form
behind me; and down there in the grave of unnumbered aeon-dead antiquities, leagues below
the dawn-lit world of men, I heard the ghastly cursing and snarling of strange-tongued fiends.
Turning, I saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss what could not be seen
against the dusk of the corridor—a nightmare horde of rushing devils; hate-distorted,
grotesquely panoplied, half-transparent; devils of a race no man might mistake—the crawling
reptiles of the nameless city.
And as the wind died away I was plunged into the ghoul-peopled blackness of earth‘s bowels;
for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal
of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun
as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.

The Quest of Iranon
(1921)
Into the granite city of Teloth wandered the youth, vine-crowned, his yellow hair glistening with
myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers of the mountain Sidrak that lies across the antique
bridge of stone. The men of Teloth are dark and stern, and dwell in square houses, and with
frowns they asked the stranger whence he had come and what were his name and fortune.
So the youth answered:
―I am Iranon, and come from Aira, a far city that I recall only dimly but seek to find again. I am
a singer of songs that I learned in the far city, and my calling is to make beauty with the things
remembered of childhood. My wealth is in little memories and dreams, and in hopes that I
sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs the lotos-buds.‖
When the men of Teloth heard these things they whispered to one another; for though in the
granite city there is no laughter or song, the stern men sometimes look to the Karthian hills in
the spring and think of the lutes of distant Oonai whereof travellers have told. And thinking
thus, they bade the stranger stay and sing in the square before the Tower of Mlin, though they
liked not the colour of his tattered robe, nor the myrrh in his hair, nor his chaplet of vine-
leaves, nor the youth in his golden voice. At evening Iranon sang, and while he sang an old
man prayed and a blind man said he saw a nimbus over the singer‘s head. But most of the
men of Teloth yawned, and some laughed and some went away to sleep; for Iranon told
nothing useful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes.
―I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window where I was rocked to
sleep. And through the window was the street where the golden lights came, and where the
shadows danced on houses of marble. I remember the square of moonlight on the floor, that
was not like any other light, and the visions that danced in the moonbeams when my mother
sang to me. And too, I remember the sun of morning bright above the many-coloured hills in
summer, and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees sing.
―O Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties! How loved I the warm and
fragrant groves across the hyaline Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra that flowed through the
verdant valley! In those groves and in that vale the children wove wreaths for one another,
and at dusk I dreamed strange dreams under the yath-trees on the mountain as I saw below
me the lights of the city, and the curving Nithra reflecting a ribbon of stars.
―And in the city were palaces of veined and tinted marble, with golden domes and painted
walls, and green gardens with cerulean pools and crystal fountains. Often I played in the
gardens and waded in the pools, and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the
trees. And sometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open
place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble and beryl, splendid in a robe of
golden flame.
―Long have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into exile; but my father
was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for it is so decreed of Fate. All through seven
lands have I sought thee, and some day shall I reign over thy groves and gardens, thy streets
and palaces, and sing to men who shall know whereof I sing, and laugh not nor turn away. For
I am Iranon, who was a Prince in Aira.‖
That night the men of Teloth lodged the stranger in a stable, and in the morning an archon
came to him and told him to go to the shop of Athok the cobbler, and be apprenticed to him.
―But I am Iranon, a singer of songs,‖ he said, ―and have no heart for the cobbler‘s trade.‖
―All in Teloth must toil,‖ replied the archon, ―for that is the law.‖ Then said Iranon,
―Wherefore do ye toil; is it not that ye may live and be happy? And if ye toil only that ye may
toil more, when shall happiness find you? Ye toil to live, but is not life made of beauty and
song? And if ye suffer no singers among you, where shall be the fruits of your toil? Toil without
song is like a weary journey without an end. Were not death more pleasing?‖ But the archon
was sullen and did not understand, and rebuked the stranger.
―Thou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face nor thy voice. The words thou speakest are
blasphemy, for the gods of Teloth have said that toil is good. Our gods have promised us a
haven of light beyond death, where there shall be rest without end, and crystal coldness
amidst which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with beauty. Go thou then to
Athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset. All here must serve, and song is folly.‖
So Iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone streets between the
gloomy square houses of granite, seeking something green in the air of spring. But in Teloth
was nothing green, for all was of stone. On the faces of men were frowns, but by the stone
embankment along the sluggish river Zuro sate a young boy with sad eyes gazing into the
waters to spy green budding branches washed down from the hills by the freshets. And the
boy said to him:
―Art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far city in a fair land? I am
Romnod, and born of the blood of Teloth, but am not old in the ways of the granite city, and
yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song. Beyond the
Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which men whisper of and say is both
lovely and terrible. Thither would I go were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst
thou go an thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the city Teloth and
fare together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and I will
attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of
dreamers. And peradventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even the fair
Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known Aira since old days, and a name often
changeth. Let us go to Oonai, O Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our
longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say.‖ And Iranon
answered:
―Be it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the mountains
and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish Zuro. But think not that delight
and understanding dwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find in a
day‘s, or a year‘s, or a lustrum‘s journey. Behold, when I was small like thee I dwelt in the
valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari, where none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself
that when older I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling dromedary-
men in the market-place. But when I went to Sinara I found the dromedary-men all drunken
and ribald, and saw that their songs were not as mine, so I travelled in a barge down the Xari
to onyx-walled Jaren. And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I
wandered to many other cities. I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and
have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once stood. I have been to Thraa, Ilarnek, and
Kadatheron on the winding river Ai, and have dwelt long in Olathoë in the land of Lomar. But
though I have had listeners sometimes, they have ever been few, and I know that welcome
shall await me only in Aira, the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as King.
So for Aira shall we seek, though it were well to visit distant and lute-blessed Oonai across
the Karthian hills, which may indeed be Aira, though I think not. Aira‘s beauty is past
imagining, and none can tell of it without rapture, whilst of Oonai the camel-drivers whisper
leeringly.‖
At the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for long wandered amidst
the green hills and cool forests. The way was rough and obscure, and never did they seem
nearer to Oonai the city of lutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon
would sing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they were both happy
after a fashion. They ate plentifully of fruit and red berries, and marked not the passing of
time, but many years must have slipped away. Small Romnod was now not so small, and
spoke deeply instead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his golden
hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods. So it came to pass one day that
Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though he had been very small when Iranon had found
him watching for green budding branches in Teloth beside the sluggish stone-banked Zuro.
Then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked
down upon the myriad lights of Oonai. Peasants had told them they were near, and Iranon
knew that this was not his native city of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira;
for they were harsh and glaring, while the lights of Aira shine as softly and magically as shone
the moonlight on the floor by the window where Iranon‘s mother once rocked him to sleep
with song. But Oonai was a city of lutes and dancing, so Iranon and Romnod went down the
steep slope that they might find men to whom songs and dreams would bring pleasure. And
when they were come into the town they found rose-wreathed revellers bound from house to
house and leaning from windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and
tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done. Then for a moment did Iranon believe
he had found those who thought and felt even as he, though the town was not an hundredth
as fair as Aira.
When dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of Oonai were not golden
in the sun, but grey and dismal. And the men of Oonai were pale with revelling and dull with
wine, and unlike the radiant men of Aira. But because the people had thrown him blossoms
and acclaimed his songs Iranon stayed on, and with him Romnod, who liked the revelry of the
town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle. Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers,
but he was always as before, crowned only with the vine of the mountains and remembering
the marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra. In the frescoed halls of the Monarch did he
sing, upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that was a mirror, and as he sang he brought
pictures to his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old, beautiful, and half-remembered
things instead of the wine-reddened feasters who pelted him with roses. And the King bade
him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of
green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on
a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower-embroidered silk. Thus
dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing.
It is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King brought to the palace
some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian desert, and dusky flute-players from Drinen in
the East, and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at Iranon as at the dancers
and the flute-players. And day by day that Romnod who had been a small boy in granite
Teloth grew coarser and redder with wine, till he dreamed less and less, and listened with less
delight to the songs of Iranon. But though Iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at
evening told again his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl. Then one night the red and
fattened Romnod snorted heavily amidst the poppied silks of his banquet-couch and died
writhing, whilst Iranon, pale and slender, sang to himself in a far corner. And when Iranon had
wept over the grave of Romnod and strown it with green budding branches, such as Romnod
used to love, he put aside his silks and gauds and went forgotten out of Oonai the city of lutes
and dancing clad only in the ragged purple in which he had come, and garlanded with fresh
vines from the mountains.
Into the sunset wandered Iranon, seeking still for his native land and for men who would
understand and cherish his songs and dreams. In all the cities of Cydathria and in the lands
beyond the Bnazic desert gay-faced children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of
purple; but Iranon stayed ever young, and wore wreaths upon his golden head whilst he sang
of Aira, delight of the past and hope of the future.
So came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd, bent and dirty, who kept lean
flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh. To this man Iranon spoke, as to so many
others:
―Canst thou tell me where I may find Aira, the city of marble and beryl, where flows the hyaline
Nithra and where the falls of the tiny Kra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath
trees?‖ And the shepherd, hearing, looked long and strangely at Iranon, as if recalling
something very far away in time, and noted each line of the stranger‘s face, and his golden
hair, and his crown of vine-leaves. But he was old, and shook his head as he replied:
―O stranger, I have indeed heard the name of Aira, and the other names thou hast spoken, but
they come to me from afar down the waste of long years. I heard them in my youth from the
lips of a playmate, a beggar‘s boy given to strange dreams, who would weave long tales
about the moon and the flowers and the west wind. We used to laugh at him, for we knew him
from his birth though he thought himself a King‘s son. He was comely, even as thou, but full of
folly and strangeness; and he ran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to
his songs and dreams. How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, and things
that never can be! Of Aira did he speak much; of Aira and the river Nithra, and the falls of the
tiny Kra. There would he ever say he once dwelt as a Prince, though here we knew him from
his birth. Nor was there ever a marble city of Aira, nor those who could delight in strange
songs, save in the dreams of mine old playmate Iranon who is gone.‖
And in the twilight, as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast on the marsh a
radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the floor as he is rocked to sleep at evening,
there walked into the lethal quicksands a very old man in tattered purple, crowned with
withered vine-leaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city where
dreams are understood. That night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world.

The Moon-Bog
(1921)
Somewhere, to what remote and fearsome region I know not, Denys Barry has gone. I was
with him the last night he lived among men, and heard his screams when the thing came to
him; but all the peasants and police in County Meath could never find him, or the others,
though they searched long and far. And now I shudder when I hear the frogs piping in
swamps, or see the moon in lonely places.
I had known Denys Barry well in America, where he had grown rich, and had congratulated
him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at sleepy Kilderry. It was from Kilderry that
his father had come, and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral
scenes. Men of his blood had once ruled over Kilderry and built and dwelt in the castle, but
those days were very remote, so that for generations the castle had been empty and
decaying. After he went to Ireland Barry wrote me often, and told me how under his care the
grey castle was rising tower by tower to its ancient splendour; how the ivy was climbing slowly
over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago, and how the peasants
blessed him for bringing back the old days with his gold from over the sea. But in time there
came troubles, and the peasants ceased to bless him, and fled away instead as from a doom.
And then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him, for he was lonely in the castle with no one
to speak to save the new servants and labourers he had brought from the north.
The bog was the cause of all these troubles, as Barry told me the night I came to the castle. I
had reached Kilderry in the summer sunset, as the gold of the sky lighted the green of the
hills and groves and the blue of the bog, where on a far islet a strange olden ruin glistened
spectrally. That sunset was very beautiful, but the peasants at Ballylough had warned me
against it and said that Kilderry had become accursed, so that I almost shuddered to see the
high turrets of the castle gilded with fire. Barry‘s motor had met me at the Ballylough station,
for Kilderry is off the railway. The villagers had shunned the car and the driver from the north,
but had whispered to me with pale faces when they saw I was going to Kilderry. And that
night, after our reunion, Barry told me why.
The peasants had gone from Kilderry because Denys Barry was to drain the great bog. For all
his love of Ireland, America had not left him untouched, and he hated the beautiful wasted
space where peat might be cut and land opened up. The legends and superstitions of Kilderry
did not move him, and he laughed when the peasants first refused to help, and then cursed
him and went away to Ballylough with their few belongings as they saw his determination. In
their place he sent for labourers from the north, and when the servants left he replaced them
likewise. But it was lonely among strangers, so Barry had asked me to come.
When I heard the fears which had driven the people from Kilderry I laughed as loudly as my
friend had laughed, for these fears were of the vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character.
They had to do with some preposterous legend of the bog, and of a grim guardian spirit that
dwelt in the strange olden ruin on the far islet I had seen in the sunset. There were tales of
dancing lights in the dark of the moon, and of chill winds when the night was warm; of wraiths
in white hovering over the waters, and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the
swampy surface. But foremost among the weird fancies, and alone in its absolute unanimity,
was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare to touch or drain the vast reddish morass.
There were secrets, said the peasants, which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain
hidden since the plague came to the children of Partholan in the fabulous years beyond
history. In the Book of Invaders it is told that these sons of the Greeks were all buried at
Tallaght, but old men in Kilderry said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moon-
goddess; so that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of Nemed swept down from
Scythia in their thirty ships.
Such were the idle tales which had made the villagers leave Kilderry, and when I heard them I
did not wonder that Denys Barry had refused to listen. He had, however, a great interest in
antiquities; and proposed to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained. The white ruins
on the islet he had often visited, but though their age was plainly great, and their contour very
little like that of most ruins in Ireland, they were too dilapidated to tell the days of their glory.
Now the work of drainage was ready to begin, and the labourers from the north were soon to
strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather, and kill the tiny shell-paved
streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with rushes.
After Barry had told me these things I was very drowsy, for the travels of the day had been
wearying and my host had talked late into the night. A manservant shewed me to my room,
which was in a remote tower overlooking the village, and the plain at the edge of the bog, and
the bog itself; so that I could see from my windows in the moonlight the silent roofs from
which the peasants had fled and which now sheltered the labourers from the north, and too,
the parish church with its antique spire, and far out across the brooding bog the remote olden
ruin on the islet gleaming white and spectral. Just as I dropped to sleep I fancied I heard faint
sounds from the distance; sounds that were wild and half musical, and stirred me with a weird
excitement which coloured my dreams. But when I awaked next morning I felt it had all been
a dream, for the visions I had seen were more wonderful than any sound of wild pipes in the
night. Influenced by the legends that Barry had related, my mind had in slumber hovered
around a stately city in a green valley, where marble streets and statues, villas and temples,
carvings and inscriptions, all spoke in certain tones the glory that was Greece. When I told
this dream to Barry we both laughed; but I laughed the louder, because he was perplexed
about his labourers from the north. For the sixth time they had all overslept, waking very
slowly and dazedly, and acting as if they had not rested, although they were known to have
gone early to bed the night before.
That morning and afternoon I wandered alone through the sun-gilded village and talked now
and then with idle labourers, for Barry was busy with the final plans for beginning his work of
drainage. The labourers were not as happy as they might have been, for most of them
seemed uneasy over some dream which they had had, yet which they tried in vain to
remember. I told them of my dream, but they were not interested till I spoke of the weird
sounds I thought I had heard. Then they looked oddly at me, and said that they seemed to
remember weird sounds, too.
In the evening Barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two
days. I was glad, for although I disliked to see the moss and the heather and the little streams
and lakes depart, I had a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the deep-matted peat
might hide. And that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden
and disquieting end; for upon the city in the valley I saw a pestilence descend, and then a
frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left
unburied only the temple of Artemis on the high peak, where the aged moon-priestess Cleis
lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head.
I have said that I awaked suddenly and in alarm. For some time I could not tell whether I was
waking or sleeping, for the sound of flutes still rang shrilly in my ears; but when I saw on the
floor the icy moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed Gothic window I decided I must be
awake and in the castle at Kilderry. Then I heard a clock from some remote landing below
strike the hour of two, and I knew I was awake. Yet still there came that monotonous piping
from afar; wild, weird airs that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant Maenalus. It
would not let me sleep, and in impatience I sprang up and paced the floor. Only by chance did
I go to the north window and look out upon the silent village and the plain at the edge of the
bog. I had no wish to gaze abroad, for I wanted to sleep; but the flutes tormented me, and I
had to do or see something. How could I have suspected the thing I was to behold?
There in the moonlight that flooded the spacious plain was a spectacle which no mortal,
having seen it, could ever forget. To the sound of reedy pipes that echoed over the bog there
glided silently and eerily a mixed throng of swaying figures, reeling through such a revel as
the Sicilians may have danced to Demeter in the old days under the harvest moon beside the
Cyane. The wide plain, the golden moonlight, the shadowy moving forms, and above all the
shrill monotonous piping, produced an effect which almost paralysed me; yet I noted amidst
my fear that half of these tireless, mechanical dancers were the labourers whom I had thought
asleep, whilst the other half were strange airy beings in white, half indeterminate in nature,
but suggesting pale wistful naiads from the haunted fountains of the bog. I do not know how
long I gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before I dropped suddenly in a
dreamless swoon, out of which the high sun of morning aroused me.
My first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to Denys
Barry, but as I saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window I became sure that
there was no reality in what I thought I had seen. I am given to strange phantasms, yet am
never weak enough to believe in them; so on this occasion contented myself with questioning
the labourers, who slept very late and recalled nothing of the previous night save misty
dreams of shrill sounds. This matter of the spectral piping harassed me greatly, and I
wondered if the crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and haunt the
visions of men. Later in the day I watched Barry in the library poring over his plans for the
great work which was to begin on the morrow, and for the first time felt a touch of the same
kind of fear that had driven the peasants away. For some unknown reason I dreaded the
thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets, and pictured terrible sights lying
black under the unmeasured depth of age-old peat. That these secrets should be brought to
light seemed injudicious, and I began to wish for an excuse to leave the castle and the village.
I went so far as to talk casually to Barry on the subject, but did not dare continue after he
gave his resounding laugh. So I was silent when the sun set fulgently over the far hills, and
Kilderry blazed all red and gold in a flame that seemed a portent.
Whether the events of that night were of reality or illusion I shall never ascertain. Certainly
they transcend anything we dream of in Nature and the universe; yet in no normal fashion can
I explain those disappearances which were known to all men after it was over. I retired early
and full of dread, and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower. It
was very dark, for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane, and would
not rise till the small hours. I thought as I lay there of Denys Barry, and of what would befall
that bog when the day came, and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into
the night, take Barry‘s car, and drive madly to Ballylough out of the menaced lands. But before
my fears could crystallise into action I had fallen asleep, and gazed in dreams upon the city in
the valley, cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow.
Probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me, yet that piping was not what I noticed first
when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog,
where the waning moon would rise, and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite
wall before me; but I had not looked for such a sight as now appeared. Light indeed glowed
on the panels ahead, but it was not any light that the moon gives. Terrible and piercing was
the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the Gothic window, and the whole
chamber was brilliant with a splendour intense and unearthly. My immediate actions were
peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen
thing. Instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light, I kept my eyes
from the window in panic fear, and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of
escape. I remember seizing my revolver and hat, but before it was over I had lost them both
without firing the one or donning the other. After a time the fascination of the red radiance
overcame my fright, and I crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening,
incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the village.
Over the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange
olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe—I must have been mad,
for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the flame-
reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-
top. Flutes shrieked and drums began to beat, and as I watched in awe and terror I thought I
saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence.
The effect was titanic—altogether unthinkable—and I might have stared indefinitely had not
the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left. Trembling with a terror oddly
mixed with ecstasy I crossed the circular room to the north window from which I could see the
village and the plain at the edge of the bog. There my eyes dilated again with a wild wonder
as great as if I had not just turned from a scene beyond the pale of Nature, for on the ghastly
red-litten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as none ever saw before
save in nightmares.
Half gliding, half floating in the air, the white-clad bog-wraiths were slowly retreating toward
the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and
solemn ceremonial dance. Their waving translucent arms, guided by the detestable piping of
those unseen flutes, beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching labourers who
followed dog-like with blind, brainless, floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but
resistless daemon-will. As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line
of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my
window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and
joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain. Despite their distance below me I at
once knew they were the servants brought from the north, for I recognised the ugly and
unwieldy form of the cook, whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic. The
flutes piped horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the
island ruin. Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one
into the ancient bog; while the line of followers, never checking their speed, splashed
awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I
could barely see in the scarlet light. And as the last pathetic straggler, the fat cook, sank
heavily out of sight in that sullen pool, the flutes and the drums grew silent, and the blinding
red rays from the ruins snapped instantaneously out, leaving the village of doom lone and
desolate in the wan beams of a new-risen moon.
My condition was now one of indescribable chaos. Not knowing whether I was mad or sane,
sleeping or waking, I was saved only by a merciful numbness. I believe I did ridiculous things
such as offering prayers to Artemis, Latona, Demeter, Persephone, and Plouton. All that I
recalled of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation roused my deepest
superstitions. I felt that I had witnessed the death of a whole village, and knew I was alone in
the castle with Denys Barry, whose boldness had brought down a doom. As I thought of him
new terrors convulsed me, and I fell to the floor; not fainting, but physically helpless. Then I
felt the icy blast from the east window where the moon had risen, and began to hear the
shrieks in the castle far below me. Soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality
which cannot be written of, and which make me faint as I think of them. All I can say is that
they came from something I had known as a friend.
At some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the screaming must have roused
me, for my next impression is of racing madly through inky rooms and corridors and out
across the courtyard into the hideous night. They found me at dawn wandering mindless near
Ballylough, but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors I had seen or heard
before. What I muttered about as I came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic
incidents which occurred in my flight; incidents of no significance, yet which haunt me
unceasingly when I am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight.
As I fled from that accursed castle along the bog‘s edge I heard a new sound; common, yet
unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry. The stagnant waters, lately quite devoid of animal
life, now teemed with a horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in
tones strangely out of keeping with their size. They glistened bloated and green in the
moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light. I followed the gaze of one very fat
and ugly frog, and saw the second of the things which drove my senses away.
Stretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the waning moon, my eyes
seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance having no reflection in the waters of the
bog. And upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly
writhing; a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen daemons. Crazed as I
was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance—a nauseous, unbelievable
caricature—a blasphemous effigy of him who had been Denys Barry.

The Outsider
(1921)
That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe;
And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form
Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm,
Were long be-nightmared.
—Keats.
Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness. Wretched is
he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and
maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque,
gigantic, and vine-encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft. Such a lot
the gods gave to me—to me, the dazed, the disappointed; the barren, the broken. And yet I
am strangely content, and cling desperately to those sere memories, when my mind
momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other.
I know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible; full
of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and
shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there
was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations. It was
never light, so that I used sometimes to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief; nor
was there any sun outdoors, since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible
tower. There was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky,
but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a well-nigh impossible climb up
the sheer wall, stone by stone.
I must have lived years in this place, but I cannot measure the time. Beings must have cared
for my needs, yet I cannot recall any person except myself; or anything alive but the noiseless
rats and bats and spiders. I think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged,
since my first conception of a living person was that of something mockingly like myself, yet
distorted, shrivelled, and decaying like the castle. To me there was nothing grotesque in the
bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the
foundations. I fantastically associated these things with every-day events, and thought them
more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which I found in many of the mouldy
books. From such books I learned all that I know. No teacher urged or guided me, and I do
not recall hearing any human voice in all those years—not even my own; for although I had
read of speech, I had never thought to try to speak aloud. My aspect was a matter equally
unthought of, for there were no mirrors in the castle, and I merely regarded myself by instinct
as akin to the youthful figures I saw drawn and painted in the books. I felt conscious of youth
because I remembered so little.
Outside, across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees, I would often lie and dream for
hours about what I read in the books; and would longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds
in the sunny world beyond the endless forest. Once I tried to escape from the forest, but as I
went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear;
so that I ran frantically back lest I lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence.
So through endless twilights I dreamed and waited, though I knew not what I waited for. Then
in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic that I could rest no more, and I
lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest into the
unknown outer sky. And at last I resolved to scale that tower, fall though I might; since it were
better to glimpse the sky and perish, than to live without ever beholding day.
In the dank twilight I climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till I reached the level where they
ceased, and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward. Ghastly and terrible
was that dead, stairless cylinder of rock; black, ruined, and deserted, and sinister with startled
bats whose wings made no noise. But more ghastly and terrible still was the slowness of my
progress; for climb as I might, the darkness overhead grew no thinner, and a new chill as of
haunted and venerable mould assailed me. I shivered as I wondered why I did not reach the
light, and would have looked down had I dared. I fancied that night had come suddenly upon
me, and vainly groped with one free hand for a window embrasure, that I might peer out and
above, and try to judge the height I had attained.
All at once, after an infinity of awesome, sightless crawling up that concave and desperate
precipice, I felt my head touch a solid thing, and I knew I must have gained the roof, or at
least some kind of floor. In the darkness I raised my free hand and tested the barrier, finding it
stone and immovable. Then came a deadly circuit of the tower, clinging to whatever holds the
slimy wall could give; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward
again, pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my fearful ascent.
There was no light revealed above, and as my hands went higher I knew that my climb was
for the nonce ended; since the slab was the trap-door of an aperture leading to a level stone
surface of greater circumference than the lower tower, no doubt the floor of some lofty and
capacious observation chamber. I crawled through carefully, and tried to prevent the heavy
slab from falling back into place; but failed in the latter attempt. As I lay exhausted on the
stone floor I heard the eerie echoes of its fall, but hoped when necessary to pry it open again.
Believing I was now at a prodigious height, far above the accursed branches of the wood, I
dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows, that I might look for the first
time upon the sky, and the moon and stars of which I had read. But on every hand I was
disappointed; since all that I found were vast shelves of marble, bearing odious oblong boxes
of disturbing size. More and more I reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide
in this high apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below. Then unexpectedly my
hands came upon a doorway, where hung a portal of stone, rough with strange chiselling.
Trying it, I found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength I overcame all obstacles and
dragged it open inward. As I did so there came to me the purest ecstasy I have ever known;
for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron, and down a short stone passageway of
steps that ascended from the newly found doorway, was the radiant full moon, which I had
never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions I dared not call memories.
Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced to rush up the
few steps beyond the door; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to
stumble, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark. It was still very dark when I reached the
grating—which I tried carefully and found unlocked, but which I did not open for fear of falling
from the amazing height to which I had climbed. Then the moon came out.
Most daemoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and grotesquely
unbelievable. Nothing I had before undergone could compare in terror with what I now saw;
with the bizarre marvels that sight implied. The sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying,
for it was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence,
there stretched around me on a level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground,
decked and diversified by marble slabs and columns, and overshadowed by an ancient stone
church, whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight.
Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that
stretched away in two directions. My mind, stunned and chaotic as it was, still held the frantic
craving for light; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my
course. I neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic;
but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost. I knew not who I was or what
I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became
conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous. I
passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns, and wandered through the
open country; sometimes following the visible road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread
across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten
road. Once I swam across a swift river where crumbling, mossy masonry told of a bridge long
vanished.
Over two hours must have passed before I reached what seemed to be my goal, a venerable
ivied castle in a thickly wooded park; maddeningly familiar, yet full of perplexing strangeness
to me. I saw that the moat was filled in, and that some of the well-known towers were
demolished; whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder. But what I observed with chief
interest and delight were the open windows—gorgeously ablaze with light and sending forth
sound of the gayest revelry. Advancing to one of these I looked in and saw an oddly dressed
company, indeed; making merry, and speaking brightly to one another. I had never, seemingly,
heard human speech before; and could guess only vaguely what was said. Some of the faces
seemed to hold expressions that brought up incredibly remote recollections; others were
utterly alien.
I now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room, stepping as I did so
from my single bright moment of hope to my blackest convulsion of despair and realisation.
The nightmare was quick to come; for as I entered, there occurred immediately one of the
most terrifying demonstrations I had ever conceived. Scarcely had I crossed the sill when
there descended upon the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of hideous intensity,
distorting every face and evoking the most horrible screams from nearly every throat. Flight
was universal, and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and were dragged away
by their madly fleeing companions. Many covered their eyes with their hands, and plunged
blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape; overturning furniture and stumbling against the
walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors.
The cries were shocking; and as I stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed, listening
to their vanishing echoes, I trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen.
At a casual inspection the room seemed deserted, but when I moved toward one of the
alcoves I thought I detected a presence there—a hint of motion beyond the golden-arched
doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room. As I approached the arch I began to
perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound I ever uttered—a
ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause—I beheld in full,
frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable monstrosity which had
by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives.
I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, uncanny,
unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable. It was the ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and
desolation; the putrid, dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation; the awful baring of that
which the merciful earth should always hide. God knows it was not of this world—or no longer
of this world—yet to my horror I saw in its eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering,
abhorrent travesty on the human shape; and in its mouldy, disintegrating apparel an
unspeakable quality that chilled me even more.
I was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight; a backward
stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, voiceless monster held me. My
eyes, bewitched by the glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them, refused to close;
though they were mercifully blurred, and shewed the terrible object but indistinctly after the
first shock. I tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that
my arm could not fully obey my will. The attempt, however, was enough to disturb my
balance; so that I had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling. As I did so I became
suddenly and agonisingly aware of the nearness of the carrion thing, whose hideous hollow
breathing I half fancied I could hear. Nearly mad, I found myself yet able to throw out a hand
to ward off the foetid apparition which pressed so close; when in one cataclysmic second of
cosmic nightmarishness and hellish accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw
of the monster beneath the golden arch.
I did not shriek, but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the night-wind shrieked for me as in that
same second there crashed down upon my mind a single and fleeting avalanche of soul-
annihilating memory. I knew in that second all that had been; I remembered beyond the
frightful castle and the trees, and recognised the altered edifice in which I now stood; I
recognised, most terrible of all, the unholy abomination that stood leering before me as I
withdrew my sullied fingers from its own.
But in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness, and that balm is nepenthe. In the
supreme horror of that second I forgot what had horrified me, and the burst of black memory
vanished in a chaos of echoing images. In a dream I fled from that haunted and accursed pile,
and ran swiftly and silently in the moonlight. When I returned to the churchyard place of
marble and went down the steps I found the stone trap-door immovable; but I was not sorry,
for I had hated the antique castle and the trees. Now I ride with the mocking and friendly
ghouls on the night-wind, and play by day amongst the catacombs of Nephren-Ka in the
sealed and unknown valley of Hadoth by the Nile. I know that light is not for me, save that of
the moon over the rock tombs of Neb, nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of Nitokris
beneath the Great Pyramid; yet in my new wildness and freedom I almost welcome the
bitterness of alienage.
For although nepenthe has calmed me, I know always that I am an outsider; a stranger in this
century and among those who are still men. This I have known ever since I stretched out my
fingers to the abomination within that great gilded frame; stretched out my fingers and
touched a cold and unyielding surface of polished glass.

The Other Gods
(1921)
Atop the tallest of earth‘s peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer no man to tell that he hath
looked upon them. Lesser peaks they once inhabited; but ever the men from the plains would
scale the slopes of rock and snow, driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till now
only the last remains. When they left their older peaks they took with them all signs of
themselves; save once, it is said, when they left a carven image on the face of the mountain
which they called Ngranek.
But now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold waste where no man
treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak whereto to flee at the coming of men.
They are grown stern, and where once they suffered men to displace them, they now forbid
men to come, or coming, to depart. It is well for men that they know not of Kadath in the cold
waste, else they would seek injudiciously to scale it.
Sometimes when earth‘s gods are homesick they visit in the still night the peaks where once
they dwelt, and weep softly as they try to play in the olden way on remembered slopes. Men
have felt the tears of the gods on white-capped Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and
have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn-winds of Lerion. In cloud-ships the
gods are wont to travel, and wise cotters have legends that keep them from certain high
peaks at night when it is cloudy, for the gods are not lenient as of old.
In Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, once dwelt an old man avid to behold the gods of
earth; a man deeply learned in the seven cryptical books of Hsan, and familiar with the
Pnakotic Manuscripts of distant and frozen Lomar. His name was Barzai the Wise, and the
villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse.
Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, and guessed
so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself. It was he who wisely advised
the burgesses of Ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats,
and who first told the young priest Atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on St. John‘s
Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore of earth‘s gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their
faces. He believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath,
so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky Hatheg-Kla on a night when he knew the
gods would be there.
Hatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is named, and rises like a
rock statue in a silent temple. Around its peak the mists play always mournfully, for mists are
the memories of the gods, and the gods loved Hatheg-Kla when they dwelt upon it in the old
days. Often the gods of earth visit Hatheg-Kla in their ships of cloud, casting pale vapours
over the slopes as they dance reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon. The villagers
of Hatheg say it is ill to climb Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when
pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them not when he came from
neighbouring Ulthar with the young priest Atal, who was his disciple. Atal was only the son of
an innkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but Barzai‘s father had been a landgrave who dwelt
in an ancient castle, so he had no common superstition in his blood, and only laughed at the
fearful cotters.
Barzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the prayers of peasants, and
talked of earth‘s gods by their campfires at night. Many days they travelled, and from afar saw
lofty Hatheg-Kla with his aureole of mournful mist. On the thirteenth day they reached the
mountain‘s lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai was old and learned and had
no fears, so led the way boldly up the slope that no man had scaled since the time of Sansu,
who is written of with fright in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts.
The way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling stones. Later it grew cold
and snowy; and Barzai and Atal often slipped and fell as they hewed and plodded upward
with staves and axes. Finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the climbers
found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marvelling at the strangeness of the
scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was
out and the pale vapours spread around. For three days they climbed higher, higher, and
higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon.
For four nights no clouds came, and the moon shone down cold through the thin mournful
mists around the silent pinnacle. Then on the fifth night, which was the night of the full moon,
Barzai saw some dense clouds far to the north, and stayed up with Atal to watch them draw
near. Thick and majestic they sailed, slowly and deliberately onward; ranging themselves
round the peak high above the watchers, and hiding the moon and the summit from view. For
a long hour the watchers gazed, whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew
thicker and more restless. Barzai was wise in the lore of earth‘s gods, and listened hard for
certain sounds, but Atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night, and feared
much. And when Barzai began to climb higher and beckon eagerly, it was long before Atal
would follow.
So thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal followed on at last, he
could scarce see the grey shape of Barzai on the dim slope above in the clouded moonlight.
Barzai forged very far ahead, and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than Atal;
fearing not the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a strong and dauntless
man, nor pausing at wide black chasms that Atal scarce could leap. And so they went up
wildly over rocks and gulfs, slipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and
horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps.
Very suddenly Barzai went out of Atal‘s sight, scaling a hideous cliff that seemed to bulge
outward and block the path for any climber not inspired of earth‘s gods. Atal was far below,
and planning what he should do when he reached the place, when curiously he noticed that
the light had grown strong, as if the cloudless peak and moonlit meeting-place of the gods
were very near. And as he scrambled on toward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears
more shocking than any he had known before. Then through the high mists he heard the
voice of unseen Barzai shouting wildly in delight:
―I have heard the gods! I have heard earth‘s gods singing in revelry on Hatheg-Kla! The
voices of earth‘s gods are known to Barzai the Prophet! The mists are thin and the moon is
bright, and I shall see the gods dancing wildly on Hatheg-Kla that they loved in youth! The
wisdom of Barzai hath made him greater than earth‘s gods, and against his will their spells
and barriers are as naught; Barzai will behold the gods, the proud gods, the secret gods, the
gods of earth who spurn the sight of men!‖
Atal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to the bulging cliff and
scanning it for foot-holds. Then he heard Barzai‘s voice grow shriller and louder:
―The mists are very thin, and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the voices of earth‘s gods
are high and wild, and they fear the coming of Barzai the Wise, who is greater than they. . . .
The moon‘s light flickers, as earth‘s gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing forms of the
gods that leap and howl in the moonlight. . . . The light is dimmer and the gods are afraid. . . .‖
Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in the air, as if the laws of
earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was steeper than ever, the upward
path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when
he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face. The light of the moon had strangely failed,
and as Atal plunged upward through the mists he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the
shadows:
―The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in the sky, for upon the
moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth‘s gods. . . . There is
unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for the screams of the frightened gods have turned to
laughter, and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am
plunging. . . . Hei! Hei! At last! In the dim light I behold the gods of earth!”
And now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in the dark a loathsome
laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard save in the Phlegethon of
unrelatable nightmares; a cry wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted
lifetime packed into one atrocious moment:
―The other gods! The other gods! The gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of
earth! . . . Look away! . . . Go back! . . . Do not see! . . . Do not see! . . . The vengeance of the
infinite abysses . . . That cursed, that damnable pit . . . Merciful gods of earth, I am falling into
the sky!”
And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to jump downward against the
frightful pull from unknown heights, there resounded on Hatheg-Kla that terrible peal of
thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of Hatheg and
Nir and Ulthar, and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the
moon that no book ever predicted. And when the moon came out at last Atal was safe on the
lower snows of the mountain without sight of earth‘s gods, or of the other gods.
Now it is told in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found naught but wordless ice
and rock when he climbed Hatheg-Kla in the youth of the world. Yet when the men of Ulthar
and Nir and Hatheg crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of
Barzai the Wise, they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a curious and
Cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide, as if the rock had been riven by some titanic chisel. And
the symbol was like to one that learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the
Pnakotic Manuscripts which are too ancient to be read. This they found.
Barzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever be persuaded to pray for
his soul‘s repose. Moreover, to this day the people of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses,
and pray by night when pale vapours hide the mountain-top and the moon. And above the
mists on Hatheg-Kla earth‘s gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for they know they are
safe, and love to come from unknown Kadath in ships of cloud and play in the olden way, as
they did when earth was new and men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places.

The Music of Erich Zann
(1921)
I have examined maps of the city with the greatest care, yet have never again found the Rue
d‘Auseil. These maps have not been modern maps alone, for I know that names change. I
have, on the contrary, delved deeply into all the antiquities of the place; and have personally
explored every region, of whatever name, which could possibly answer to the street I knew as
the Rue d‘Auseil. But despite all I have done it remains an humiliating fact that I cannot find
the house, the street, or even the locality, where, during the last months of my impoverished
life as a student of metaphysics at the university, I heard the music of Erich Zann.
That my memory is broken, I do not wonder; for my health, physical and mental, was gravely
disturbed throughout the period of my residence in the Rue d‘Auseil, and I recall that I took
none of my few acquaintances there. But that I cannot find the place again is both singular
and perplexing; for it was within a half-hour‘s walk of the university and was distinguished by
peculiarities which could hardly be forgotten by anyone who had been there. I have never met
a person who has seen the Rue d‘Auseil.
The Rue d‘Auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear-windowed
warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone. It was always shadowy along
that river, as if the smoke of neighbouring factories shut out the sun perpetually. The river was
also odorous with evil stenches which I have never smelled elsewhere, and which may some
day help me to find it, since I should recognise them at once. Beyond the bridge were narrow
cobbled streets with rails; and then came the ascent, at first gradual, but incredibly steep as
the Rue d‘Auseil was reached.
I have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the Rue d‘Auseil. It was almost a
cliff, closed to all vehicles, consisting in several places of flights of steps, and ending at the
top in a lofty ivied wall. Its paving was irregular, sometimes stone slabs, sometimes
cobblestones, and sometimes bare earth with struggling greenish-grey vegetation. The
houses were tall, peaked-roofed, incredibly old, and crazily leaning backward, forward, and
sidewise. Occasionally an opposite pair, both leaning forward, almost met across the street
like an arch; and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground below. There were a few
overhead bridges from house to house across the street.
The inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly. At first I thought it was because they
were all silent and reticent; but later decided it was because they were all very old. I do not
know how I came to live on such a street, but I was not myself when I moved there. I had
been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money; until at last I came upon
that tottering house in the Rue d‘Auseil, kept by the paralytic Blandot. It was the third house
from the top of the street, and by far the tallest of them all.
My room was on the fifth story; the only inhabited room there, since the house was almost
empty. On the night I arrived I heard strange music from the peaked garret overhead, and the
next day asked old Blandot about it. He told me it was an old German viol-player, a strange
dumb man who signed his name as Erich Zann, and who played evenings in a cheap theatre
orchestra; adding that Zann‘s desire to play in the night after his return from the theatre was
the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was
the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity
and panorama beyond.
Thereafter I heard Zann every night, and although he kept me awake, I was haunted by the
weirdness of his music. Knowing little of the art myself, I was yet certain that none of his
harmonies had any relation to music I had heard before; and concluded that he was a
composer of highly original genius. The longer I listened, the more I was fascinated, until after
a week I resolved to make the old man‘s acquaintance.
One night, as he was returning from his work, I intercepted Zann in the hallway and told him
that I would like to know him and be with him when he played. He was a small, lean, bent
person, with shabby clothes, blue eyes, grotesque, satyr-like face, and nearly bald head; and
at my first words seemed both angered and frightened. My obvious friendliness, however,
finally melted him; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark, creaking, and
rickety attic stairs. His room, one of only two in the steeply pitched garret, was on the west
side, toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street. Its size was very great, and
seemed the greater because of its extraordinary bareness and neglect. Of furniture there was
only a narrow iron bedstead, a dingy washstand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron
music-rack, and three old-fashioned chairs. Sheets of music were piled in disorder about the
floor. The walls were of bare boards, and had probably never known plaster; whilst the
abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited.
Evidently Erich Zann‘s world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination.
Motioning me to sit down, the dumb man closed the door, turned the large wooden bolt, and
lighted a candle to augment the one he had brought with him. He now removed his viol from
its moth-eaten covering, and taking it, seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs.
He did not employ the music-rack, but offering no choice and playing from memory,
enchanted me for over an hour with strains I had never heard before; strains which must have
been of his own devising. To describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in
music. They were a kind of fugue, with recurrent passages of the most captivating quality, but
to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird notes I had overheard from my room
below on other occasions.
Those haunting notes I had remembered, and had often hummed and whistled inaccurately to
myself; so when the player at length laid down his bow I asked him if he would render some
of them. As I began my request the wrinkled satyr-like face lost the bored placidity it had
possessed during the playing, and seemed to shew the same curious mixture of anger and
fright which I had noticed when first I accosted the old man. For a moment I was inclined to
use persuasion, regarding rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my
host‘s weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had listened the night before.
But I did not pursue this course for more than a moment; for when the dumb musician
recognised the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly
beyond analysis, and his long, cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and
silence the crude imitation. As he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a
startled glance toward the lone curtained window, as if fearful of some intruder—a glance
doubly absurd, since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the adjacent roofs, this
window being the only point on the steep street, as the concierge had told me, from which
one could see over the wall at the summit.
The old man‘s glance brought Blandot‘s remark to my mind, and with a certain capriciousness
I felt a wish to look out over the wide and dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights
beyond the hill-top, which of all the dwellers in the Rue d‘Auseil only this crabbed musician
could see. I moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains,
when with a frightened rage even greater than before the dumb lodger was upon me again;
this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither
with both hands. Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I ordered him to release me, and
told him I would go at once. His clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offence his
own anger seemed to subside. He tightened his relaxing grip, but this time in a friendly
manner; forcing me into a chair, then with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the
littered table, where he wrote many words with a pencil in the laboured French of a foreigner.
The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness. Zann said
that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with
his music and with other things. He had enjoyed my listening to his music, and wished I would
come again and not mind his eccentricities. But he could not play to another his weird
harmonies, and could not bear hearing them from another; nor could he bear having anything
in his room touched by another. He had not known until our hallway conversation that I could
overhear his playing in my room, and now asked me if I would arrange with Blandot to take a
lower room where I could not hear him in the night. He would, he wrote, defray the difference
in rent.
As I sat deciphering the execrable French I felt more lenient toward the old man. He was a
victim of physical and nervous suffering, as was I; and my metaphysical studies had taught
me kindness. In the silence there came a slight sound from the window—the shutter must
have rattled in the night-wind—and for some reason I started almost as violently as did Erich
Zann. So when I had finished reading I shook my host by the hand, and departed as a friend.
The next day Blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor, between the
apartments of an aged money-lender and the room of a respectable upholsterer. There was
no one on the fourth floor.
It was not long before I found that Zann‘s eagerness for my company was not as great as it
had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story. He did not ask
me to call on him, and when I did call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly. This was
always at night—in the day he slept and would admit no one. My liking for him did not grow,
though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me. I had a
curious desire to look out of that window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the
glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there. Once I went up to the garret during
theatre hours, when Zann was away, but the door was locked.
What I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man. At
first I would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking
staircase to the peaked garret. There in the narrow hall, outside the bolted door with the
covered keyhole, I often heard sounds which filled me with an indefinable dread—the dread of
vague wonder and brooding mystery. It was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were
not; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and that at certain
intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly conceive as produced by
one player. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power. As the weeks passed, the
playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and
furtiveness pitiful to behold. He now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me
whenever we met on the stairs.
Then one night as I listened at the door I heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of
sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there
not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real—the awful,
inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in moments of the most
terrible fear or anguish. I knocked repeatedly at the door, but received no response. Afterward
I waited in the black hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician‘s
feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair. Believing him just conscious after a
fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the same time calling out my name reassuringly. I heard
Zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which
he falteringly unfastened to admit me. This time his delight at having me present was real; for
his distorted face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its
mother‘s skirts.
Shaking pathetically, the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into another, beside
which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor. He sat for some time inactive, nodding
oddly, but having a paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening. Subsequently
he seemed to be satisfied, and crossing to a chair by the table wrote a brief note, handed it to
me, and returned to the table, where he began to write rapidly and incessantly. The note
implored me in the name of mercy, and for the sake of my own curiosity, to wait where I was
while he prepared a full account in German of all the marvels and terrors which beset him. I
waited, and the dumb man‘s pencil flew.
It was perhaps an hour later, while I still waited and while the old musician‘s feverishly written
sheets still continued to pile up, that I saw Zann start as from the hint of a horrible shock.
Unmistakably he was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly. Then I half
fancied I heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible sound, but rather an exquisitely
low and infinitely distant musical note, suggesting a player in one of the neighbouring houses,
or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look. Upon Zann
the effect was terrible, for dropping his pencil suddenly he rose, seized his viol, and
commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing I had ever heard from his bow save
when listening at the barred door.
It would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that dreadful night. It was more
horrible than anything I had ever overheard, because I could now see the expression of his
face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear. He was trying to make a noise;
to ward something off or drown something out—what, I could not imagine, awesome though I
felt it must be. The playing grew fantastic, delirious, and hysterical, yet kept to the last the
qualities of supreme genius which I knew this strange old man possessed. I recognised the
air—it was a wild Hungarian dance popular in the theatres, and I reflected for a moment that
this was the first time I had ever heard Zann play the work of another composer.
Louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate
viol. The player was dripping with an uncanny perspiration and twisted like a monkey, always
looking frantically at the curtained window. In his frenzied strains I could almost see shadowy
satyrs and Bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through seething abysses of clouds and
smoke and lightning. And then I thought I heard a shriller, steadier note that was not from the
viol; a calm, deliberate, purposeful, mocking note from far away in the west.
At this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night-wind which had sprung up
outside as if in answer to the mad playing within. Zann‘s screaming viol now outdid itself,
emitting sounds I had never thought a viol could emit. The shutter rattled more loudly,
unfastened, and commenced slamming against the window. Then the glass broke shiveringly
under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and
rustling the sheets of paper on the table where Zann had begun to write out his horrible
secret. I looked at Zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation. His blue eyes were
bulging, glassy, and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, mechanical,
unrecognisable orgy that no pen could even suggest.
A sudden gust, stronger than the others, caught up the manuscript and bore it toward the
window. I followed the flying sheets in desperation, but they were gone before I reached the
demolished panes. Then I remembered my old wish to gaze from this window, the only
window in the Rue d‘Auseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall, and the city
outspread beneath. It was very dark, but the city‘s lights always burned, and I expected to see
them there amidst the rain and wind. Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows,
looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the night-wind, I saw no
city spread below, and no friendly lights gleaming from remembered streets, but only the
blackness of space illimitable; unimagined space alive with motion and music, and having no
semblance to anything on earth. And as I stood there looking in terror, the wind blew out both
the candles in that ancient peaked garret, leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness
with chaos and pandemonium before me, and the daemon madness of that night-baying viol
behind me.
I staggered back in the dark, without the means of striking a light, crashing against the table,
overturning a chair, and finally groping my way to the place where the blackness screamed
with shocking music. To save myself and Erich Zann I could at least try, whatever the powers
opposed to me. Once I thought some chill thing brushed me, and I screamed, but my scream
could not be heard above that hideous viol. Suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing
bow struck me, and I knew I was close to the player. I felt ahead, touched the back of Zann‘s
chair, and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to bring him to his senses.
He did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening. I moved my hand to his
head, whose mechanical nodding I was able to stop, and shouted in his ear that we must both
flee from the unknown things of the night. But he neither answered me nor abated the frenzy
of his unutterable music, while all through the garret strange currents of wind seemed to
dance in the darkness and babel. When my hand touched his ear I shuddered, though I knew
not why—knew not why till I felt of the still face; the ice-cold, stiffened, unbreathing face
whose glassy eyes bulged uselessly into the void. And then, by some miracle finding the door
and the large wooden bolt, I plunged wildly away from that glassy-eyed thing in the dark, and
from the ghoulish howling of that accursed viol whose fury increased even as I plunged.
Leaping, floating, flying down those endless stairs through the dark house; racing mindlessly
out into the narrow, steep, and ancient street of steps and tottering houses; clattering down
steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and the putrid canyon-walled river; panting across
the great dark bridge to the broader, healthier streets and boulevards we know; all these are
terrible impressions that linger with me. And I recall that there was no wind, and that the moon
was out, and that all the lights of the city twinkled.
Despite my most careful searches and investigations, I have never since been able to find the
Rue d‘Auseil. But I am not wholly sorry; either for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses
of the closely written sheets which alone could have explained the music of Erich Zann.

Herbert West — Reanimator
(1922)
I. From the Dark
Of Herbert West, who was my friend in college and in after life, I can speak only with extreme
terror. This terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance, but
was engendered by the whole nature of his life-work, and first gained its acute form more than
seventeen years ago, when we were in the third year of our course at the Miskatonic
University Medical School in Arkham. While he was with me, the wonder and diabolism of his
experiments fascinated me utterly, and I was his closest companion. Now that he is gone and
the spell is broken, the actual fear is greater. Memories and possibilities are ever more
hideous than realities.
The first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock I ever experienced, and
it is only with reluctance that I repeat it. As I have said, it happened when we were in the
medical school, where West had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on
the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially. His views, which were
widely ridiculed by the faculty and his fellow-students, hinged on the essentially mechanistic
nature of life; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by
calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes. In his experiments with
various animating solutions he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits, guinea-
pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, till he had become the prime nuisance of the college. Several
times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent
signs; but he soon saw that the perfection of this process, if indeed possible, would
necessarily involve a lifetime of research. It likewise became clear that, since the same
solution never worked alike on different organic species, he would require human subjects for
further and more specialised progress. It was here that he first came into conflict with the
college authorities, and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the
dean of the medical school himself—the learned and benevolent Dr. Allan Halsey, whose
work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of Arkham.
I had always been exceptionally tolerant of West‘s pursuits, and we frequently discussed his
theories, whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite. Holding with Haeckel that
all life is a chemical and physical process, and that the so-called ―soul‖ is a myth, my friend
believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues;
and that unless actual decomposition has set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may with
suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life. That the psychic
or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive brain-cells which
even a short period of death would be apt to cause, West fully realised. It had at first been his
hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death, and only
repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial life-motions were
incompatible. He then sought extreme freshness in his specimens, injecting his solutions into
the blood immediately after the extinction of life. It was this circumstance which made the
professors so carelessly sceptical, for they felt that true death had not occurred in any case.
They did not stop to view the matter closely and reasoningly.
It was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that West confided to me his
resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner, and continue in secret the experiments
he could no longer perform openly. To hear him discussing ways and means was rather
ghastly, for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves. Whenever
the morgue proved inadequate, two local negroes attended to this matter, and they were
seldom questioned. West was then a small, slender, spectacled youth with delicate features,
yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice, and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the
relative merits of Christchurch Cemetery and the potter‘s field. We finally decided on the
potter‘s field, because practically every body in Christchurch was embalmed; a thing of course
ruinous to West‘s researches.
I was by this time his active and enthralled assistant, and helped him make all his decisions,
not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome
work. It was I who thought of the deserted Chapman farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill, where
we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory, each with dark curtains to
conceal our midnight doings. The place was far from any road, and in sight of no other house,
yet precautions were none the less necessary; since rumours of strange lights, started by
chance nocturnal roamers, would soon bring disaster on our enterprise. It was agreed to call
the whole thing a chemical laboratory if discovery should occur. Gradually we equipped our
sinister haunt of science with materials either purchased in Boston or quietly borrowed from
the college—materials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyes—and provided
spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar. At the college we
used an incinerator, but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory. Bodies
were always a nuisance—even the small guinea-pig bodies from the slight clandestine
experiments in West‘s room at the boarding-house.
We followed the local death-notices like ghouls, for our specimens demanded particular
qualities. What we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial
preservation; preferably free from malforming disease, and certainly with all organs present.
Accident victims were our best hope. Not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable;
though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities, ostensibly in the college‘s interest, as
often as we could without exciting suspicion. We found that the college had first choice in
every case, so that it might be necessary to remain in Arkham during the summer, when only
the limited summer-school classes were held. In the end, though, luck favoured us; for one
day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter‘s field; a brawny young workman drowned
only the morning before in Sumner‘s Pond, and buried at the town‘s expense without delay or
embalming. That afternoon we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after
midnight.
It was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours, even though we lacked at
that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us. We carried
spades and oil dark lanterns, for although electric torches were then manufactured, they were
not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today. The process of unearthing was slow
and sordid—it might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of
scientists—and we were glad when our spades struck wood. When the pine box was fully
uncovered West scrambled down and removed the lid, dragging out and propping up the
contents. I reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave, and then both toiled hard
to restore the spot to its former appearance. The affair made us rather nervous, especially the
stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy, but we managed to remove all traces of our visit.
When we had patted down the last shovelful of earth we put the specimen in a canvas sack
and set out for the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill.
On an improvised dissecting-table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a powerful acetylene
lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking. It had been a sturdy and apparently
unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type—large-framed, grey-eyed, and brown-
haired—a sound animal without psychological subtleties, and probably having vital processes
of the simplest and healthiest sort. Now, with the eyes closed, it looked more asleep than
dead; though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score. We had at last what
West had always longed for—a real dead man of the ideal kind, ready for the solution as
prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use. The tension
on our part became very great. We knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like
complete success, and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial
animation. Especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the
creature, since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might
well have suffered deterioration. I, myself, still held some curious notions about the traditional
―soul‖ of man, and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the
dead. I wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres, and
what he could relate if fully restored to life. But my wonder was not overwhelming, since for
the most part I shared the materialism of my friend. He was calmer than I as he forced a large
quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body‘s arm, immediately binding the incision securely.
The waiting was gruesome, but West never faltered. Every now and then he applied his
stethoscope to the specimen, and bore the negative results philosophically. After about three-
quarters of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution
inadequate, but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the
formula before disposing of his ghastly prize. We had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar,
and would have to fill it by dawn—for although we had fixed a lock on the house we wished to
shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery. Besides, the body would not be even
approximately fresh the next night. So taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent
laboratory, we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing
of a new solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by West with an almost fanatical
care.
The awful event was very sudden, and wholly unexpected. I was pouring something from one
test-tube to another, and West was busy over the alcohol blast-lamp which had to answer for
a Bunsen burner in this gasless edifice, when from the pitch-black room we had left there
burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard.
Not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened
to release the agony of the damned, for in one inconceivable cacophony was centred all the
supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature. Human it could not have been—it is
not in man to make such sounds—and without a thought of our late employment or its
possible discovery both West and I leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals;
overturning tubes, lamp, and retorts, and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural
night. I think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town, though as
we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint—just enough to seem like
belated revellers staggering home from a debauch.
We did not separate, but managed to get to West‘s room, where we whispered with the gas
up until dawn. By then we had calmed ourselves a little with rational theories and plans for
investigation, so that we could sleep through the day—classes being disregarded. But that
evening two items in the paper, wholly unrelated, made it again impossible for us to sleep.
The old deserted Chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes;
that we could understand because of the upset lamp. Also, an attempt had been made to
disturb a new grave in the potter‘s field, as if by futile and spadeless clawing at the earth. That
we could not understand, for we had patted down the mould very carefully.
And for seventeen years after that West would look frequently over his shoulder, and
complain of fancied footsteps behind him. Now he has disappeared.
II. The Plague-Daemon
I shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago, when like a noxious afrite from
the halls of Eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through Arkham. It is by that satanic scourge that
most recall the year, for truly terror brooded with bat-wings over the piles of coffins in the
tombs of Christchurch Cemetery; yet for me there is a greater horror in that time—a horror
known to me alone now that Herbert West has disappeared.
West and I were doing post-graduate work in summer classes at the medical school of
Miskatonic University, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments
leading toward the revivification of the dead. After the scientific slaughter of uncounted small
animals the freakish work had ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean, Dr. Allan
Halsey; though West had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy boarding-
house room, and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its
grave in the potter‘s field to a deserted farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill.
I was with him on that odious occasion, and saw him inject into the still veins the elixir which
he thought would to some extent restore life‘s chemical and physical processes. It had ended
horribly—in a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought
nerves—and West had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of
being haunted and hunted. The body had not been quite fresh enough; it is obvious that to
restore normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed; and a burning of the old
house had prevented us from burying the thing. It would have been better if we could have
known it was underground.
After that experience West had dropped his researches for some time; but as the zeal of the
born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the college faculty, pleading
for the use of the dissecting-room and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as
so overwhelmingly important. His pleas, however, were wholly in vain; for the decision of Dr.
Halsey was inflexible, and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader. In the
radical theory of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful
enthusiast whose slight form, yellow hair, spectacled blue eyes, and soft voice gave no hint of
the supernormal—almost diabolical—power of the cold brain within. I can see him now as he
was then—and I shiver. He grew sterner of face, but never elderly. And now Sefton Asylum
has had the mishap and West has vanished.
West clashed disagreeably with Dr. Halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a
wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy. He felt
that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work; a work which he
could of course conduct to suit himself in later years, but which he wished to begin while still
possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university. That the tradition-bound elders should
ignore his singular results on animals, and persist in their denial of the possibility of
reanimation, was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of West‘s
logical temperament. Only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental
limitations of the ―professor-doctor‖ type—the product of generations of pathetic Puritanism;
kindly, conscientious, and sometimes gentle and amiable, yet always narrow, intolerant,
custom-ridden, and lacking in perspective. Age has more charity for these incomplete yet
high-souled characters, whose worst real vice is timidity, and who are ultimately punished by
general ridicule for their intellectual sins—sins like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, anti-Darwinism,
anti-Nietzscheism, and every sort of Sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation. West, young
despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and
his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove
his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion. Like most youths,
he indulged in elaborate day-dreams of revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous
forgiveness.
And then had come the scourge, grinning and lethal, from the nightmare caverns of Tartarus.
West and I had graduated about the time of its beginning, but had remained for additional
work at the summer school, so that we were in Arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury
upon the town. Though not as yet licenced physicians, we now had our degrees, and were
pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew. The situation was
almost past management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to
handle. Burials without embalming were made in rapid succession, and even the Christchurch
Cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead. This
circumstance was not without effect on West, who thought often of the irony of the situation—
so many fresh specimens, yet none for his persecuted researches! We were frightfully
overworked, and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly.
But West‘s gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties. College had all but
closed, and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague. Dr.
Halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service, applying his extreme skill
with whole-hearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or
apparent hopelessness. Before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular
hero, though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing
with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion. West could not withhold admiration for the
fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of
his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and
municipal health regulations, he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the
university dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his
solution. The thing actually opened its eyes, but only stared at the ceiling with a look of soul-
petrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it. West
said it was not fresh enough—the hot summer air does not favour corpses. That time we were
almost caught before we incinerated the thing, and West doubted the advisability of repeating
his daring misuse of the college laboratory.
The peak of the epidemic was reached in August. West and I were almost dead, and Dr.
Halsey did die on the 14th. The students all attended the hasty funeral on the 15th, and
bought an impressive wreath, though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent
by wealthy Arkham citizens and by the municipality itself. It was almost a public affair, for the
dean had surely been a public benefactor. After the entombment we were all somewhat
depressed, and spent the afternoon at the bar of the Commercial House; where West, though
shaken by the death of his chief opponent, chilled the rest of us with references to his
notorious theories. Most of the students went home, or to various duties, as the evening
advanced; but West persuaded me to aid him in ―making a night of it‖. West‘s landlady saw us
arrive at his room about two in the morning, with a third man between us; and told her
husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather well.
Apparently this acidulous matron was right; for about 3 a.m. the whole house was aroused by
cries coming from West‘s room, where when they broke down the door they found the two of
us unconscious on the blood-stained carpet, beaten, scratched, and mauled, and with the
broken remnants of West‘s bottles and instruments around us. Only an open window told
what had become of our assailant, and many wondered how he himself had fared after the
terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made. There were some
strange garments in the room, but West upon regaining consciousness said they did not
belong to the stranger, but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course
of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases. He ordered them burnt as soon as
possible in the capacious fireplace. To the police we both declared ignorance of our late
companion‘s identity. He was, West nervously said, a congenial stranger whom we had met at
some downtown bar of uncertain location. We had all been rather jovial, and West and I did
not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down.
That same night saw the beginning of the second Arkham horror—the horror that to me
eclipsed the plague itself. Christchurch Cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing; a
watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description, but
raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed. The victim had been seen alive
considerably after midnight—the dawn revealed the unutterable thing. The manager of a
circus at the neighbouring town of Bolton was questioned, but he swore that no beast had at
any time escaped from its cage. Those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to
the receiving tomb, where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate. A
fainter trail led away toward the woods, but it soon gave out.
The next night devils danced on the roofs of Arkham, and unnatural madness howled in the
wind. Through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the
plague, and which some whispered was the embodied daemon-soul of the plague itself. Eight
houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wake—in all,
seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless,
sadistic monster that crept abroad. A few persons had half seen it in the dark, and said it was
white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend. It had not left behind quite all that it
had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry. The number it had killed was fourteen; three
of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive.
On the third night frantic bands of searchers, led by the police, captured it in a house on
Crane Street near the Miskatonic campus. They had organised the quest with care, keeping in
touch by means of volunteer telephone stations, and when someone in the college district had
reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window, the net was quickly spread. On account
of the general alarm and precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was
effected without major casualties. The thing was finally stopped by a bullet, though not a fatal
one, and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathing.
For it had been a man. This much was clear despite the nauseous eyes, the voiceless
simianism, and the daemoniac savagery. They dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum
at Sefton, where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen years—until the
recent mishap, when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention. What had most
disgusted the searchers of Arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster‘s face was
cleaned—the mocking, unbelievable resemblance to a learned and self-sacrificing martyr who
had been entombed but three days before—the late Dr. Allan Halsey, public benefactor and
dean of the medical school of Miskatonic University.
To the vanished Herbert West and to me the disgust and horror were supreme. I shudder
tonight as I think of it; shudder even more than I did that morning when West muttered
through his bandages,
―Damn it, it wasn‘t quite fresh enough!‖
III. Six Shots by Midnight
It is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would
probably be sufficient, but many things in the life of Herbert West were uncommon. It is, for
instance, not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles
which guide his selection of a home and office, yet that was the case with Herbert West.
When he and I obtained our degrees at the medical school of Miskatonic University, and
sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners, we took great care not to
say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated, and as near as possible to
the potter‘s field.
Reticence such as this is seldom without a cause, nor indeed was ours; for our requirements
were those resulting from a life-work distinctly unpopular. Outwardly we were doctors only, but
beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible moment—for the essence of
Herbert West‘s existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown, in
which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the
graveyard‘s cold clay. Such a quest demands strange materials, among them fresh human
bodies; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly
and not far from a place of informal interment.
West and I had met in college, and I had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous
experiments. Gradually I had come to be his inseparable assistant, and now that we were out
of college we had to keep together. It was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in
company, but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in Bolton—a factory
town near Arkham, the seat of the college. The Bolton Worsted Mills are the largest in the
Miskatonic Valley, and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local
physicians. We chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather run-down
cottage near the end of Pond Street; five numbers from the closest neighbour, and separated
from the local potter‘s field by only a stretch of meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the
rather dense forest which lies to the north. The distance was greater than we wished, but we
could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field, wholly out of the factory
district. We were not much displeased, however, since there were no people between us and
our sinister source of supplies. The walk was a trifle long, but we could haul our silent
specimens undisturbed.
Our practice was surprisingly large from the very first—large enough to please most young
doctors, and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay
elsewhere. The mill-hands were of somewhat turbulent inclinations; and besides their many
natural needs, their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do. But what
actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar—the
laboratory with the long table under the electric lights, where in the small hours of the morning
we often injected West‘s various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the
potter‘s field. West was experimenting madly to find something which would start man‘s vital
motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death, but had encountered
the most ghastly obstacles. The solution had to be differently compounded for different
types—what would serve for guinea-pigs would not serve for human beings, and different
human specimens required large modifications.
The bodies had to be exceedingly fresh, or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would
render perfect reanimation impossible. Indeed, the greatest problem was to get them fresh
enough—West had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with
corpses of doubtful vintage. The results of partial or imperfect animation were much more
hideous than were the total failures, and we both held fearsome recollections of such things.
Ever since our first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on Meadow Hill in Arkham,
we had felt a brooding menace; and West, though a calm, blond, blue-eyed scientific
automaton in most respects, often confessed to a shuddering sensation of stealthy pursuit.
He half felt that he was followed—a psychological delusion of shaken nerves, enhanced by
the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of our reanimated specimens was still alive—a
frightful carnivorous thing in a padded cell at Sefton. Then there was another—our first—
whose exact fate we had never learned.
We had fair luck with specimens in Bolton—much better than in Arkham. We had not been
settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial, and made it open
its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed. It had lost an arm—if
it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better. Between then and the next
January we secured three more; one total failure, one case of marked muscular motion, and
one rather shivery thing—it rose of itself and uttered a sound. Then came a period when luck
was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased
or too maimed for use. We kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with
systematic care.
One March night, however, we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from
the potter‘s field. In Bolton the prevailing spirit of Puritanism had outlawed the sport of
boxing—with the usual result. Surreptitious and ill-conducted bouts among the mill-workers
were common, and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported. This late
winter night there had been such a match; evidently with disastrous results, since two
timorous Poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very
secret and desperate case. We followed them to an abandoned barn, where the remnants of
a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floor.
The match had been between Kid O‘Brien—a lubberly and now quaking youth with a most un-
Hibernian hooked nose—and Buck Robinson, ―The Harlem Smoke‖. The negro had been
knocked out, and a moment‘s examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so.
He was a loathsome, gorilla-like thing, with abnormally long arms which I could not help
calling fore legs, and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable Congo secrets and
tom-tom poundings under an eerie moon. The body must have looked even worse in life—but
the world holds many ugly things. Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they did not
know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; and they were
grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered to get rid of the thing
quietly—for a purpose I knew too well.
There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape, but we dressed the thing and
carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows, as we had carried a
similar thing one horrible night in Arkham. We approached the house from the field in the rear,
took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs, and prepared it for the usual
experiment. Our fear of the police was absurdly great, though we had timed our trip to avoid
the solitary patrolman of that section.
The result was wearily anticlimactic. Ghastly as our prize appeared, it was wholly
unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm; solutions prepared from
experience with white specimens only. So as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn, we did
as we had done with the others—dragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the
woods near the potter‘s field, and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground
would furnish. The grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous
specimen—the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound. In the light of our dark
lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines, fairly certain that the police would
never find it in a forest so dim and dense.
The next day I was increasingly apprehensive about the police, for a patient brought rumours
of a suspected fight and death. West had still another source of worry, for he had been called
in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly. An Italian woman had become
hysterical over her missing child—a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and
failed to appear for dinner—and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an
always weak heart. It was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before; but
Italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as much harassed by
omens as by facts. About seven o‘clock in the evening she had died, and her frantic husband
had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her
life. Friends had held him when he drew a stiletto, but West departed amidst his inhuman
shrieks, curses, and oaths of vengeance. In his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have
forgotten his child, who was still missing as the night advanced. There was some talk of
searching the woods, but most of the family‘s friends were busy with the dead woman and the
screaming man. Altogether, the nervous strain upon West must have been tremendous.
Thoughts of the police and of the mad Italian both weighed heavily.
We retired about eleven, but I did not sleep well. Bolton had a surprisingly good police force
for so small a town, and I could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of
the night before were ever tracked down. It might mean the end of all our local work—and
perhaps prison for both West and me. I did not like those rumours of a fight which were
floating about. After the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes, but I turned over
without rising to pull down the shade. Then came the steady rattling at the back door.
I lay still and somewhat dazed, but before long heard West‘s rap on my door. He was clad in
dressing-gown and slippers, and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight. From
the revolver I knew that he was thinking more of the crazed Italian than of the police.
―We‘d better both go,‖ he whispered. ―It wouldn‘t do not to answer it anyway, and it may be a
patient—it would be like one of those fools to try the back door.‖
So we both went down the stairs on tiptoe, with a fear partly justified and partly that which
comes only from the soul of the weird small hours. The rattling continued, growing somewhat
louder. When we reached the door I cautiously unbolted it and threw it open, and as the moon
streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there, West did a peculiar thing. Despite
the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police
investigation—a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our
cottage—my friend suddenly, excitedly, and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his
revolver into the nocturnal visitor.
For that visitor was neither Italian nor policeman. Looming hideously against the spectral
moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmares—a glassy-eyed,
ink-black apparition nearly on all fours, covered with bits of mould, leaves, and vines, foul with
caked blood, and having between its glistening teeth a snow-white, terrible, cylindrical object
terminating in a tiny hand.
IV. The Scream of the Dead
The scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of Dr. Herbert West which
harassed the latter years of our companionship. It is natural that such a thing as a dead man‘s
scream should give horror, for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but I was
used to similar experiences, hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular
circumstance. And, as I have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that I became afraid.
Herbert West, whose associate and assistant I was, possessed scientific interests far beyond
the usual routine of a village physician. That was why, when establishing his practice in
Bolton, he had chosen an isolated house near the potter‘s field. Briefly and brutally stated,
West‘s sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation,
leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution. For this
ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human
bodies; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure, and
human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different
types of organisms. Scores of rabbits and guinea-pigs had been killed and treated, but their
trail was a blind one. West had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to
secure a corpse sufficiently fresh. What he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only
just departed; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward
that mode of motion called life. There was hope that this second and artificial life might be
made perpetual by repetitions of the injection, but we had learned that an ordinary natural life
would not respond to the action. To establish the artificial motion, natural life must be extinct—
the specimens must be very fresh, but genuinely dead.
The awesome quest had begun when West and I were students at the Miskatonic University
Medical School in Arkham, vividly conscious for the first time of the thoroughly mechanical
nature of life. That was seven years before, but West looked scarcely a day older now—he
was small, blond, clean-shaven, soft-voiced, and spectacled, with only an occasional flash of
a cold blue eye to tell of the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the
pressure of his terrible investigations. Our experiences had often been hideous in the
extreme; the results of defective reanimation, when lumps of graveyard clay had been
galvanised into morbid, unnatural, and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital
solution.
One thing had uttered a nerve-shattering scream; another had risen violently, beaten us both
to unconsciousness, and run amuck in a shocking way before it could be placed behind
asylum bars; still another, a loathsome African monstrosity, had clawed out of its shallow
grave and done a deed—West had had to shoot that object. We could not get bodies fresh
enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated, so had perforce created nameless
horrors. It was disturbing to think that one, perhaps two, of our monsters still lived—that
thought haunted us shadowingly, till finally West disappeared under frightful circumstances.
But at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the isolated Bolton cottage, our fears
were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely fresh specimens. West was more avid than I, so
that it almost seemed to me that he looked half-covetously at any very healthy living
physique.
It was in July, 1910, that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn. I had been on a
long visit to my parents in Illinois, and upon my return found West in a state of singular
elation. He had, he told me excitedly, in all likelihood solved the problem of freshness through
an approach from an entirely new angle—that of artificial preservation. I had known that he
was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound, and was not surprised that
it had turned out well; but until he explained the details I was rather puzzled as to how such a
compound could help in our work, since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was
largely due to delay occurring before we secured them. This, I now saw, West had clearly
recognised; creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use, and
trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse, as it had years before
when we obtained the negro killed in the Bolton prize-fight. At last fate had been kind, so that
on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by
any possibility have begun. What would happen on reanimation, and whether we could hope
for a revival of mind and reason, West did not venture to predict. The experiment would be a
landmark in our studies, and he had saved the new body for my return, so that both might
share the spectacle in accustomed fashion.
West told me how he had obtained the specimen. It had been a vigorous man; a well-dressed
stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the Bolton Worsted Mills.
The walk through the town had been long, and by the time the traveller paused at our cottage
to ask the way to the factories his heart had become greatly overtaxed. He had refused a
stimulant, and had suddenly dropped dead only a moment later. The body, as might be
expected, seemed to West a heaven-sent gift. In his brief conversation the stranger had made
it clear that he was unknown in Bolton, and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed
him to be one Robert Leavitt of St. Louis, apparently without a family to make instant inquiries
about his disappearance. If this man could not be restored to life, no one would know of our
experiment. We buried our materials in a dense strip of woods between the house and the
potter‘s field. If, on the other hand, he could be restored, our fame would be brilliantly and
perpetually established. So without delay West had injected into the body‘s wrist the
compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival. The matter of the presumably
weak heart, which to my mind imperiled the success of our experiment, did not appear to
trouble West extensively. He hoped at last to obtain what he had never obtained before—a
rekindled spark of reason and perhaps a normal, living creature.
So on the night of July 18, 1910, Herbert West and I stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed
at a white, silent figure beneath the dazzling arc-light. The embalming compound had worked
uncannily well, for as I stared fascinatedly at the sturdy frame which had lain two weeks
without stiffening I was moved to seek West‘s assurance that the thing was really dead. This
assurance he gave readily enough; reminding me that the reanimating solution was never
used without careful tests as to life; since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality
were present. As West proceeded to take preliminary steps, I was impressed by the vast
intricacy of the new experiment; an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand less delicate
than his own. Forbidding me to touch the body, he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside
the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound. This, he said,
was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the
reanimating solution might freely work when injected. Slightly later, when a change and a
gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs, West stuffed a pillow-like object violently over
the twitching face, not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt
at reanimation. The pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute
lifelessness, withdrew satisfied, and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured
amount of the vital elixir, prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used
since college days, when our feats were new and groping. I cannot express the wild,
breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen—the
first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to tell of what it
had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss.
West was a materialist, believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to
bodily phenomena; consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs
and caverns beyond death‘s barrier. I did not wholly disagree with him theoretically, yet held
vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers; so that I could not help
eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation. Besides—I could not
extract from my memory that hideous, inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first
experiment in the deserted farmhouse at Arkham.
Very little time had elapsed before I saw the attempt was not to be a total failure. A touch of
colour came to cheeks hitherto chalk-white, and spread out under the curiously ample stubble
of sandy beard. West, who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist, suddenly nodded
significantly; and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the
body‘s mouth. There followed a few spasmodic muscular motions, and then an audible
breathing and visible motion of the chest. I looked at the closed eyelids, and thought I
detected a quivering. Then the lids opened, shewing eyes which were grey, calm, and alive,
but still unintelligent and not even curious.
In a moment of fantastic whim I whispered questions to the reddening ears; questions of other
worlds of which the memory might still be present. Subsequent terror drove them from my
mind, but I think the last one, which I repeated, was: ―Where have you been?‖ I do not yet
know whether I was answered or not, for no sound came from the well-shaped mouth; but I
do know that at that moment I firmly thought the thin lips moved silently, forming syllables I
would have vocalised as ―only now‖ if that phrase had possessed any sense or relevancy. At
that moment, as I say, I was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been
attained; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by
actual reason. In the next moment there was no doubt about the triumph; no doubt that the
solution had truly accomplished, at least temporarily, its full mission of restoring rational and
articulate life to the dead. But in that triumph there came to me the greatest of all horrors—not
horror of the thing that spoke, but of the deed that I had witnessed and of the man with whom
my professional fortunes were joined.
For that very fresh body, at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated
at the memory of its last scene on earth, threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle
with the air; and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there
could be no return, screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain:
―Help! Keep off, you cursed little tow-head fiend—keep that damned needle away from me!‖
V. The Horror from the Shadows
Many men have related hideous things, not mentioned in print, which happened on the
battlefields of the Great War. Some of these things have made me faint, others have
convulsed me with devastating nausea, while still others have made me tremble and look
behind me in the dark; yet despite the worst of them I believe I can myself relate the most
hideous thing of all—the shocking, the unnatural, the unbelievable horror from the shadows.
In 1915 I was a physician with the rank of First Lieutenant in a Canadian regiment in
Flanders, one of many Americans to precede the government itself into the gigantic struggle. I
had not entered the army on my own initiative, but rather as a natural result of the enlistment
of the man whose indispensable assistant I was—the celebrated Boston surgical specialist,
Dr. Herbert West. Dr. West had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war,
and when the chance had come he carried me with him almost against my will. There were
reasons why I would have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why I found the
practice of medicine and the companionship of West more and more irritating; but when he
had gone to Ottawa and through a colleague‘s influence secured a medical commission as
Major, I could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that I should accompany
him in my usual capacity.
When I say that Dr. West was avid to serve in battle, I do not mean to imply that he was either
naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation. Always an ice-cold intellectual
machine; slight, blond, blue-eyed, and spectacled; I think he secretly sneered at my
occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality. There was, however,
something he wanted in embattled Flanders; and in order to secure it he had to assume a
military exterior. What he wanted was not a thing which many persons want, but something
connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite
clandestinely to follow, and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous
results. It was, in fact, nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in
every stage of dismemberment.
Herbert West needed fresh bodies because his life-work was the reanimation of the dead.
This work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after
his arrival in Boston; but was only too well known to me, who had been his closest friend and
sole assistant since the old days in Miskatonic University Medical School at Arkham. It was in
those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then
on human bodies shockingly obtained. There was a solution which he injected into the veins
of dead things, and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways. He had had
much trouble in discovering the proper formula, for each type of organism was found to need
a stimulus especially adapted to it. Terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures;
nameless things resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh. A certain
number of these failures had remained alive—one was in an asylum while others had
vanished—and as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible eventualities he often
shivered beneath his usual stolidity.
West had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens,
and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in body-snatching. In
college, and during our early practice together in the factory town of Bolton, my attitude
toward him had been largely one of fascinated admiration; but as his boldness in methods
grew, I began to develop a gnawing fear. I did not like the way he looked at healthy living
bodies; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when I learned that
a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it. That was the first time he had
ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse; and his success, obtained
at such a loathsome cost, had completely hardened him.
Of his methods in the intervening five years I dare not speak. I was held to him by sheer force
of fear, and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat. Gradually I came to find
Herbert West himself more horrible than anything he did—that was when it dawned on me
that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere
morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness. His interest
became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal; he
gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead
from fright and disgust; he became, behind his pallid intellectuality, a fastidious Baudelaire of
physical experiment—a languid Elagabalus of the tombs.
Dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved. I think the climax came when
he had proved his point that rational life can be restored, and had sought new worlds to
conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies. He had wild and
original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nerve-tissue separated
from natural physiological systems; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the
form of never-dying, artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an
indescribable tropical reptile. Two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle—first,
whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain,
proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve-centres; and second, whether any kind of
ethereal, intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically
separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism. All this research work
required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh—and that was why Herbert
West had entered the Great War.
The phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in March, 1915, in a field
hospital behind the lines at St. Eloi. I wonder even now if it could have been other than a
daemoniac dream of delirium. West had a private laboratory in an east room of the barn-like
temporary edifice, assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for
the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming. There he worked like a butcher in the
midst of his gory wares—I could never get used to the levity with which he handled and
classified certain things. At times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers;
but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind, requiring many explanations
of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned. Among these
sounds were frequent revolver-shots—surely not uncommon on a battlefield, but distinctly
uncommon in an hospital. Dr. West‘s reanimated specimens were not meant for long
existence or a large audience. Besides human tissue, West employed much of the reptile
embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results. It was better than human
material for maintaining life in organless fragments, and that was now my friend‘s chief
activity. In a dark corner of the laboratory, over a queer incubating burner, he kept a large
covered vat full of this reptilian cell-matter; which multiplied and grew puffily and hideously.
On the night of which I speak we had a splendid new specimen—a man at once physically
powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system was assured. It was
rather ironic, for he was the officer who had helped West to his commission, and who was
now to have been our associate. Moreover, he had in the past secretly studied the theory of
reanimation to some extent under West. Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, D.S.O., was
the greatest surgeon in our division, and had been hastily assigned to the St. Eloi sector when
news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters. He had come in an aëroplane piloted by the
intrepid Lieut. Ronald Hill, only to be shot down when directly over his destination. The fall
had been spectacular and awful; Hill was unrecognisable afterward, but the wreck yielded up
the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated but otherwise intact condition. West had greedily
seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and fellow-scholar; and I shuddered
when he finished severing the head, placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile-tissue to
preserve it for future experiments, and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the
operating table. He injected new blood, joined certain veins, arteries, and nerves at the
headless neck, and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified
specimen which had borne an officer‘s uniform. I knew what he wanted—to see if this highly
organised body could exhibit, without its head, any of the signs of mental life which had
distinguished Sir Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee. Once a student of reanimation, this silent trunk
was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it.
I can still see Herbert West under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating
solution into the arm of the headless body. The scene I cannot describe—I should faint if I
tried it, for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things, with blood and lesser
human debris almost ankle-deep on the slimy floor, and with hideous reptilian abnormalities
sprouting, bubbling, and baking over a winking bluish-green spectre of dim flame in a far
corner of black shadows.
The specimen, as West repeatedly observed, had a splendid nervous system. Much was
expected of it; and as a few twitching motions began to appear, I could see the feverish
interest on West‘s face. He was ready, I think, to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion
that consciousness, reason, and personality can exist independently of the brain—that man
has no central connective spirit, but is merely a machine of nervous matter, each section
more or less complete in itself. In one triumphant demonstration West was about to relegate
the mystery of life to the category of myth. The body now twitched more vigorously, and
beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way. The arms stirred disquietingly,
the legs drew up, and various muscles contracted in a repulsive kind of writhing. Then the
headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which was unmistakably one of desperation—
an intelligent desperation apparently sufficient to prove every theory of Herbert West.
Certainly, the nerves were recalling the man‘s last act in life; the struggle to get free of the
falling aëroplane.
What followed, I shall never positively know. It may have been wholly an hallucination from
the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a
cataclysm of German shell-fire—who can gainsay it, since West and I were the only proved
survivors? West liked to think that before his recent disappearance, but there were times
when he could not; for it was queer that we both had the same hallucination. The hideous
occurrence itself was very simple, notable only for what it implied.
The body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping, and we had heard a sound. I
should not call that sound a voice, for it was too awful. And yet its timbre was not the most
awful thing about it. Neither was its message—it had merely screamed, ―Jump, Ronald, for
God‘s sake, jump!‖ The awful thing was its source.
For it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling black shadows.
VI. The Tomb-Legions
When Dr. Herbert West disappeared a year ago, the Boston police questioned me closely.
They suspected that I was holding something back, and perhaps suspected graver things; but
I could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it. They knew, indeed,
that West had been connected with activities beyond the credence of ordinary men; for his
hideous experiments in the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit
of perfect secrecy; but the final soul-shattering catastrophe held elements of daemoniac
phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what I saw.
I was West‘s closest friend and only confidential assistant. We had met years before, in
medical school, and from the first I had shared his terrible researches. He had slowly tried to
perfect a solution which, injected into the veins of the newly deceased, would restore life; a
labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural
actions. Still more shocking were the products of some of the experiments—grisly masses of
flesh that had been dead, but that West waked to a blind, brainless, nauseous animation.
These were the usual results, for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to have
specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the delicate brain-cells.
This need for very fresh corpses had been West‘s moral undoing. They were hard to get, and
one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and vigorous. A struggle, a
needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse, and the experiment
had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment; but West had emerged with a soul
calloused and seared, and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous
and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous
physique. Toward the last I became acutely afraid of West, for he began to look at me that
way. People did not seem to notice his glances, but they noticed my fear; and after his
disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicions.
West, in reality, was more afraid than I; for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of
furtiveness and dread of every shadow. Partly it was the police he feared; but sometimes his
nervousness was deeper and more nebulous, touching on certain indescribable things into
which he had injected a morbid life, and from which he had not seen that life depart. He
usually finished his experiments with a revolver, but a few times he had not been quick
enough. There was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later
seen. There was also that Arkham professor‘s body which had done cannibal things before it
had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at Sefton, where it beat the
walls for sixteen years. Most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to
speak of—for in later years West‘s scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and
fantastic mania, and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but
isolated parts of bodies, or parts joined to organic matter other than human. It had become
fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared; many of the experiments could not even be
hinted at in print. The Great War, through which both of us served as surgeons, had
intensified this side of West.
In saying that West‘s fear of his specimens was nebulous, I have in mind particularly its
complex nature. Part of it came merely from knowing of the existence of such nameless
monsters, while another part arose from apprehension of the bodily harm they might under
certain circumstances do him. Their disappearance added horror to the situation—of them all
West knew the whereabouts of only one, the pitiful asylum thing. Then there was a more
subtle fear—a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the Canadian
army in 1915. West, in the midst of a severe battle, had reanimated Major Sir Eric Moreland
Clapham-Lee, D.S.O., a fellow-physician who knew about his experiments and could have
duplicated them. The head had been removed, so that the possibilities of quasi-intelligent life
in the trunk might be investigated. Just as the building was wiped out by a German shell,
there had been a success. The trunk had moved intelligently; and, unbelievable to relate, we
were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay
in a shadowy corner of the laboratory. The shell had been merciful, in a way—but West could
never feel as certain as he wished, that we two were the only survivors. He used to make
shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of
reanimating the dead.
West‘s last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance, overlooking one of the
oldest burying-grounds in Boston. He had chosen the place for purely symbolic and
fantastically aesthetic reasons, since most of the interments were of the colonial period and
therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies. The laboratory was in a sub-
cellar secretly constructed by imported workmen, and contained a huge incinerator for the
quiet and complete disposal of such bodies, or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies,
as might remain from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner.
During the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient
masonry; undoubtedly connected with the old burying-ground, yet far too deep to correspond
with any known sepulchre therein. After a number of calculations West decided that it
represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the Averills, where the last interment
had been made in 1768. I was with him when he studied the nitrous, dripping walls laid bare
by the spades and mattocks of the men, and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which
would attend the uncovering of centuried grave-secrets; but for the first time West‘s new
timidity conquered his natural curiosity, and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by ordering the
masonry left intact and plastered over. Thus it remained till that final hellish night; part of the
walls of the secret laboratory. I speak of West‘s decadence, but must add that it was a purely
mental and intangible thing. Outwardly he was the same to the last—calm, cold, slight, and
yellow-haired, with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears
seemed never to change. He seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed grave and
looked over his shoulder; even when he thought of the carnivorous thing that gnawed and
pawed at Sefton bars.
The end of Herbert West began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his
curious glance between the newspaper and me. A strange headline item had struck at him
from the crumpled pages, and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through
sixteen years. Something fearsome and incredible had happened at Sefton Asylum fifty miles
away, stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police. In the small hours of the morning a
body of silent men had entered the grounds and their leader had aroused the attendants. He
was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed
almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried. His expressionless
face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty, but had shocked the superintendent when
the hall light fell on it—for it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass. Some nameless
accident had befallen this man. A larger man guided his steps; a repellent hulk whose bluish
face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady. The speaker had asked for the
custody of the cannibal monster committed from Arkham sixteen years before; and upon
being refused, gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot. The fiends had beaten,
trampled, and bitten every attendant who did not flee; killing four and finally succeeding in the
liberation of the monster. Those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that
the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the wax-faced
leader. By the time help could be summoned, every trace of the men and of their mad charge
had vanished.
From the hour of reading this item until midnight, West sat almost paralysed. At midnight the
doorbell rang, startling him fearfully. All the servants were asleep in the attic, so I answered
the bell. As I have told the police, there was no wagon in the street; but only a group of
strange-looking figures bearing a large square box which they deposited in the hallway after
one of them had grunted in a highly unnatural voice, ―Express—prepaid.‖ They filed out of the
house with a jerky tread, and as I watched them go I had an odd idea that they were turning
toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted. When I slammed the
door after them West came downstairs and looked at the box. It was about two feet square,
and bore West‘s correct name and present address. It also bore the inscription, ―From Eric
Moreland Clapham-Lee, St. Eloi, Flanders‖. Six years before, in Flanders, a shelled hospital
had fallen upon the headless reanimated trunk of Dr. Clapham-Lee, and upon the detached
head which—perhaps—had uttered articulate sounds.
West was not even excited now. His condition was more ghastly. Quickly he said, ―It‘s the
finish—but let‘s incinerate—this.‖ We carried the thing down to the laboratory—listening. I do
not remember many particulars—you can imagine my state of mind—but it is a vicious lie to
say it was Herbert West‘s body which I put into the incinerator. We both inserted the whole
unopened wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity. Nor did any sound come
from the box, after all.
It was West who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the ancient tomb
masonry had been covered up. I was going to run, but he stopped me. Then I saw a small
black aperture, felt a ghoulish wind of ice, and smelled the charnel bowels of a putrescent
earth. There was no sound, but just then the electric lights went out and I saw outlined against
some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only
insanity—or worse—could create. Their outlines were human, semi-human, fractionally
human, and not human at all—the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous. They were
removing the stones quietly, one by one, from the centuried wall. And then, as the breach
became large enough, they came out into the laboratory in single file; led by a stalking thing
with a beautiful head made of wax. A sort of mad-eyed monstrosity behind the leader seized
on Herbert West. West did not resist or utter a sound. Then they all sprang at him and tore
him to pieces before my eyes, bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of
fabulous abominations. West‘s head was carried off by the wax-headed leader, who wore a
Canadian officer‘s uniform. As it disappeared I saw that the blue eyes behind the spectacles
were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic, visible emotion.
Servants found me unconscious in the morning. West was gone. The incinerator contained
only unidentifiable ashes. Detectives have questioned me, but what can I say? The Sefton
tragedy they will not connect with West; not that, nor the men with the box, whose existence
they deny. I told them of the vault, and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed.
So I told them no more. They imply that I am a madman or a murderer—probably I am mad.
But I might not be mad if those accursed tomb-legions had not been so silent.

Hypnos
(1922)
To S. L.
―Apropos of sleep, that sinister adventure of all our nights, we may say that men go
to bed daily with an audacity that would be incomprehensible if we did not know
that it is the result of ignorance of the danger.‖
—Baudelaire.
May the merciful gods, if indeed there be such, guard those hours when no power of the will,
or drug that the cunning of man devises, can keep me from the chasm of sleep. Death is
merciful, for there is no return therefrom, but with him who has come back out of the
nethermost chambers of night, haggard and knowing, peace rests nevermore. Fool that I was
to plunge with such unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate;
fool or god that he was—my only friend, who led me and went before me, and who in the end
passed into terrors which may yet be mine.
We met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the centre of a crowd of the vulgarly
curious. He was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight
black-clad body a strange rigidity. I think he was then approaching forty years of age, for there
were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually beautiful; and
touches of grey in the thick, waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the
deepest raven black. His brow was white as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and
breadth almost godlike. I said to myself, with all the ardour of a sculptor, that this man was a
faun‘s statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple‘s ruins and brought somehow to life in
our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years. And when he opened
his immense, sunken, and wildly luminous black eyes I knew he would be thenceforth my only
friend—the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before—for I saw that such
eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal
consciousness and reality; realms which I had cherished in fancy, but vainly sought. So as I
drove the crowd away I told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader
in unfathomed mysteries, and he assented without speaking a word. Afterward I found that his
voice was music—the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres. We talked often in the
night, and in the day, when I chiselled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to
immortalise his different expressions.
Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a connexion with anything of
the world as living men conceive it. They were of that vaster and more appalling universe of
dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter, time, and space, and whose
existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleep—those rare dreams beyond dreams
which come never to common men, and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men.
The cosmos of our waking knowledge, born from such an universe as a bubble is born from
the pipe of a jester, touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when
sucked back by the jester‘s whim. Men of learning suspect it little, and ignore it mostly. Wise
men have interpreted dreams, and the gods have laughed. One man with Oriental eyes has
said that all time and space are relative, and men have laughed. But even that man with
Oriental eyes has done no more than suspect. I had wished and tried to do more than
suspect, and my friend had tried and partly succeeded. Then we both tried together, and with
exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old
manor-house in hoary Kent.
Among the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments—inarticulateness. What I
learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told—for want of symbols
or suggestions in any language. I say this because from first to last our discoveries partook
only of the nature of sensations; sensations correlated with no impression which the nervous
system of normal humanity is capable of receiving. They were sensations, yet within them lay
unbelievable elements of time and space—things which at bottom possess no distinct and
definite existence. Human utterance can best convey the general character of our
experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for in every period of revelation some part
of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present, rushing aërially along
shocking, unlighted, and fear-haunted abysses, and occasionally tearing through certain well-
marked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous, uncouth clouds or vapours. In
these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes together. When we
were together, my friend was always far ahead; I could comprehend his presence despite the
absence of form by a species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me, golden
from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty, its anomalously youthful cheeks, its
burning eyes, its Olympian brow, and its shadowing hair and growth of beard.
Of the progress of time we kept no record, for time had become to us the merest illusion. I
know only that there must have been something very singular involved, since we came at
length to marvel why we did not grow old. Our discourse was unholy, and always hideously
ambitious—no god or daemon could have aspired to discoveries and conquests like those
which we planned in whispers. I shiver as I speak of them, and dare not be explicit; though I
will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue,
and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled
night sky. I will hint—only hint—that he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible
universe and more; designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command,
and the destinies of all living things be his. I affirm—I swear—that I had no share in these
extreme aspirations. Anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be
erroneous, for I am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable warfare in unmentionable
spheres by which alone one might achieve success.
There was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless
vacua beyond all thought and entity. Perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible
sort thronged upon us; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy, yet
which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others.
Viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession, and at length I felt that we had
been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known. My friend
was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether, and I could
see the sinister exultation on his floating, luminous, too youthful memory-face. Suddenly that
face became dim and quickly disappeared, and in a brief space I found myself projected
against an obstacle which I could not penetrate. It was like the others, yet incalculably denser;
a sticky, clammy mass, if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a non-material
sphere.
I had, I felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed.
Struggling anew, I came to the end of the drug-dream and opened my physical eyes to the
tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my
fellow-dreamer, weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed gold-green light on his
marble features. Then, after a short interval, the form in the corner stirred; and may pitying
heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me. I
cannot tell you how he shrieked, or what vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in
black eyes crazed with fright. I can only say that I fainted, and did not stir till he himself
recovered and shook me in his phrensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolation.
That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream. Awed, shaken, and
portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never
venture within those realms again. What he had seen, he dared not tell me; but he said from
his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep us
awake. That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me
whenever consciousness lapsed. After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst
my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair
whiten almost before one‘s eyes. Our mode of life was now totally altered. Heretofore a
recluse so far as I know—his true name and origin never having passed his lips—my friend
now became frantic in his fear of solitude. At night he would not be alone, nor would the
company of a few persons calm him. His sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most
general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies of the young and the gay were unknown
to us. Our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which I keenly
resented, but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude. Especially was he afraid
to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would
often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein. He did not
always glance at the same place in the sky—it seemed to be a different place at different
times. On spring evenings it would be low in the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly
overhead. In the autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but
mostly if in the small hours of morning. Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him.
Only after two years did I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see
that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different
times corresponded to the direction of his glance—a spot roughly marked by the constellation
Corona Borealis.
We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the days when we
had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world. We were aged and weak from our
drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain, and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had
become snow-white. Our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb
more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace.
Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy. My
statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had no means to purchase new materials, or
energy to fashion them even had I possessed them. We suffered terribly, and on a certain
night my friend sank into a deep-breathing sleep from which I could not awaken him. I can
recall the scene now—the desolate, pitch-black garret studio under the eaves with the rain
beating down; the ticking of the lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested
on the dressing-table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house;
certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and worst of all the deep, steady, sinister
breathing of my friend on the couch—a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure
moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden,
unimagined, and hideously remote.
The tension of my vigil became oppressive, and a wild train of trivial impressions and
associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind. I heard a clock strike somewhere—
not ours, for that was not a striking clock—and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-
point for idle wanderings. Clocks—time—space—infinity—and then my fancy reverted to the
local as I reflected that even now, beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the
atmosphere, Corona Borealis was rising in the northeast. Corona Borealis, which my friend
had appeared to dread, and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing
unseen through the measureless abysses of aether. All at once my feverishly sensitive ears
seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of drug-magnified
sounds—a low and damnably insistent whine from very far away; droning, clamouring,
mocking, calling, from the northeast.
But it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such
a seal of fright as may never in life be removed; not that which drew the shrieks and excited
the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door. It was not what I
heard, but what I saw; for in that dark, locked, shuttered, and curtained room there appeared
from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible red-gold light—a shaft which bore with it no
glow to disperse the darkness, but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the
troubled sleeper, bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful
memory-face as I had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time, when my
friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret, innermost, and forbidden caverns of
nightmare.
And as I looked, I beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and deep-sunken eyes open in
terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered. There
dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face, as it shone bodiless, luminous, and rejuvenated in the
blackness, more of stark, teeming, brain-shattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth
has ever revealed to me. No word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and
nearer, but as I followed the memory-face‘s mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its
source, the source whence also the whining came, I too saw for an instant what it saw, and
fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking and epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the
police. Never could I tell, try as I might, what it actually was that I saw; nor could the still face
tell, for although it must have seen more than I did, it will never speak again. But always I
shall guard against the mocking and insatiate Hypnos, lord of sleep, against the night sky, and
against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy.
Just what happened is unknown, for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and
hideous thing, but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not
madness. They have said, I know not for what reason, that I never had a friend, but that art,
philosophy, and insanity had filled all my tragic life. The lodgers and police on that night
soothed me, and the doctor administered something to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a
nightmare event had taken place. My stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they
found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and now a
fame which I spurn in despair as I sit for hours, bald, grey-bearded, shrivelled, palsied, drug-
crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the object they found.
For they deny that I sold the last of my statuary, and point with ecstasy at the thing which the
shining shaft of light left cold, petrified, and unvocal. It is all that remains of my friend; the
friend who led me on to madness and wreckage; a godlike head of such marble as only old
Hellas could yield, young with the youth that is outside time, and with beauteous bearded
face, curved, smiling lips, Olympian brow, and dense locks waving and poppy-crowned. They
say that that haunting memory-face is modelled from my own, as it was at twenty-five, but
upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of Attica—‘ΥΠΝΟΣ.

What the Moon Brings
(1922)
I hate the moon—I am afraid of it—for when it shines on certain scenes familiar and loved it
sometimes makes them unfamiliar and hideous.
It was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden where I
wandered; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of foliage that bring wild
and many-coloured dreams. And as I walked by the shallow crystal stream I saw unwonted
ripples tipped with yellow light, as if those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents
to strange oceans that are not in the world. Silent and sparkling, bright and baleful, those
moon-cursed waters hurried I knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white lotos
blossoms fluttered one by one in the opiate night-wind and dropped despairingly into the
stream, swirling away horribly under the arched, carven bridge, and staring back with the
sinister resignation of calm, dead faces.
And as I ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened
ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces, I saw that the garden had
no end under that moon; for where by day the walls were, there stretched now only new
vistas of trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas, and bendings of the
yellow-litten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble. And the lips of
the dead lotos-faces whispered sadly, and bade me follow, nor did I cease my steps till the
stream became a river, and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches of
gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea.
Upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded.
And as I saw therein the lotos-faces vanish, I longed for nets that I might capture them and
learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night. But when the moon
went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, I saw in that light old
spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green
seaweed. And knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did
not wish again to speak with the lotos-faces.
Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast
reef, I would fain have questioned him, and asked him of those whom I had known when they
were alive. This I would have asked him had he not been so far away, but he was very far,
and could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef.
So I watched the tide go out under that sinking moon, and saw gleaming the spires, the
towers, and the roofs of that dead, dripping city. And as I watched, my nostrils tried to close
against the perfume-conquering stench of the world‘s dead; for truly, in this unplaced and
forgotten spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy sea-worms to gnaw and
glut upon.
Over those horrors the evil moon now hung very low, but the puffy worms of the sea need no
moon to feed by. And as I watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath, I felt
a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror
before my eyes had seen it.
Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I saw that the waters had
ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef whose rim I had seen before. And when I saw
that this reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead
now shone in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles
below, I shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters, and lest the hidden
eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon.
And to escape this relentless thing I plunged gladly and unhesitatingly into the stinking
shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets fat sea-worms feast upon the world‘s
dead.

Azathoth
(1922)
When age fell upon the world, and wonder went out of the minds of men; when grey cities
reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly, in whose shadow none might dream of the
sun or of spring‘s flowering meads; when learning stripped earth of her mantle of beauty, and
poets sang no more save of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and inward-looking eyes;
when these things had come to pass, and childish hopes had gone away forever, there was a
man who travelled out of life on a quest into the spaces whither the world‘s dreams had fled.
Of the name and abode of this man but little is written, for they were of the waking world only;
yet it is said that both were obscure. It is enough to know that he dwelt in a city of high walls
where sterile twilight reigned, and that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil, coming
home at evening to a room whose one window opened not on the fields and groves but on a
dim court where other windows stared in dull despair. From that casement one might see only
walls and windows, except sometimes when one leaned far out and peered aloft at the small
stars that passed. And because mere walls and windows must soon drive to madness a man
who dreams and reads much, the dweller in that room used night after night to lean out and
peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world and the greyness of
tall cities. After years he began to call the slow-sailing stars by name, and to follow them in
fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight; till at length his vision opened to many secret
vistas whose existence no common eye suspects. And one night a mighty gulf was bridged,
and the dream-haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher‘s window to merge with the
close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonder.
There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold; vortices of
dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the
worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having
in their whirlpools strange dolphins and sea-nymphs of unrememberable deeps. Noiseless
infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that
leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men‘s calendars the tides of
far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have
lost. And in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise
shore; a green shore fragrant with lotus-blossoms and starred by red camalotes.

The Hound
(1922)
In my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and flapping, and a faint,
distant baying as of some gigantic hound. It is not dream—it is not, I fear, even madness—for
too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts. St. John is a mangled
corpse; I alone know why, and such is my knowledge that I am about to blow out my brains for
fear I shall be mangled in the same way. Down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldritch
phantasy sweeps the black, shapeless Nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation.
May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate! Wearied
with the commonplaces of a prosaic world, where even the joys of romance and adventure
soon grow stale, St. John and I had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual
movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui. The enigmas of the Symbolists
and the ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but each new mood was
drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal. Only the sombre philosophy of the
Decadents could hold us, and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and
diabolism of our penetrations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till
finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences
and adventures. It was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable
course which even in my present fear I mention with shame and timidity—that hideous
extremity of human outrage, the abhorred practice of grave-robbing.
I cannot reveal the details of our shocking expeditions, or catalogue even partly the worst of
the trophies adorning the nameless museum we prepared in the great stone house where we
jointly dwelt, alone and servantless. Our museum was a blasphemous, unthinkable place,
where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and
decay to excite our jaded sensibilities. It was a secret room, far, far underground; where huge
winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green
and orange light, and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the
lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings. Through these
pipes came at will the odours our moods most craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral
lilies, sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined Eastern shrines of the kingly dead, and
sometimes—how I shudder to recall it!—the frightful, soul-upheaving stenches of the
uncovered grave.
Around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with
comely, life-like bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermist‘s art, and with
headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world. Niches here and there
contained skulls of all shapes, and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution. There
one might find the rotting, bald pates of famous noblemen, and the fresh and radiantly golden
heads of new-buried children. Statues and paintings there were, all of fiendish subjects and
some executed by St. John and myself. A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held
certain unknown and unnamable drawings which it was rumoured Goya had perpetrated but
dared not acknowledge. There were nauseous musical instruments, stringed, brass, and
wood-wind, on which St. John and I sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity
and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the
most incredible and unimaginable variety of tomb-loot ever assembled by human madness
and perversity. It is of this loot in particular that I must not speak—thank God I had the
courage to destroy it long before I thought of destroying myself.
The predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always
artistically memorable events. We were no vulgar ghouls, but worked only under certain
conditions of mood, landscape, environment, weather, season, and moonlight. These
pastimes were to us the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression, and we gave their
details a fastidious technical care. An inappropriate hour, a jarring lighting effect, or a clumsy
manipulation of the damp sod, would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which
followed the exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth. Our quest for novel
scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiate—St. John was always the leader,
and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking, that accursed spot which brought us
our hideous and inevitable doom.
By what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible Holland churchyard? I think it was the
dark rumour and legendry, the tales of one buried for five centuries, who had himself been a
ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre. I can recall the scene
in these final moments—the pale autumnal moon over the graves, casting long horrible
shadows; the grotesque trees, drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the
crumbling slabs; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the
antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the phosphorescent
insects that danced like death-fires under the yews in a distant corner; the odours of mould,
vegetation, and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the night-wind from over far
swamps and seas; and worst of all, the faint deep-toned baying of some gigantic hound which
we could neither see nor definitely place. As we heard this suggestion of baying we
shuddered, remembering the tales of the peasantry; for he whom we sought had centuries
before been found in this selfsame spot, torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some
unspeakable beast.
I remembered how we delved in this ghoul‘s grave with our spades, and how we thrilled at the
picture of ourselves, the grave, the pale watching moon, the horrible shadows, the grotesque
trees, the titanic bats, the antique church, the dancing death-fires, the sickening odours, the
gently moaning night-wind, and the strange, half-heard, directionless baying, of whose
objective existence we could scarcely be sure. Then we struck a substance harder than the
damp mould, and beheld a rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long
undisturbed ground. It was incredibly tough and thick, but so old that we finally pried it open
and feasted our eyes on what it held.
Much—amazingly much—was left of the object despite the lapse of five hundred years. The
skeleton, though crushed in places by the jaws of the thing that had killed it, held together
with surprising firmness, and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long, firm teeth and
its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our own. In the coffin lay an
amulet of curious and exotic design, which had apparently been worn around the sleeper‘s
neck. It was the oddly conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound, or sphinx with a
semi-canine face, and was exquisitely carved in antique Oriental fashion from a small piece of
green jade. The expression on its features was repellent in the extreme, savouring at once of
death, bestiality, and malevolence. Around the base was an inscription in characters which
neither St. John nor I could identify; and on the bottom, like a maker‘s seal, was graven a
grotesque and formidable skull.
Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it; that this treasure
alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave. Even had its outlines been unfamiliar we
would have desired it, but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar.
Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we
recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul
Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central
Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab
daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of
the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead.
Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern-eyed face of
its owner and closed up the grave as we found it. As we hastened from that abhorrent spot,
the stolen amulet in St. John‘s pocket, we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the
earth we had so lately rifled, as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment. But the
autumn moon shone weak and pale, and we could not be sure. So, too, as we sailed the next
day away from Holland to our home, we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some
gigantic hound in the background. But the autumn wind moaned sad and wan, and we could
not be sure.
II.
Less than a week after our return to England, strange things began to happen. We lived as
recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-
house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the
knock of the visitor. Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent
fumblings in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well
as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the
moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping
sound not far off. On each occasion investigation revealed nothing, and we began to ascribe
the occurrences to imagination alone—that same curiously disturbed imagination which still
prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the Holland churchyard.
The jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum, and sometimes we burned strangely
scented candles before it. We read much in Alhazred‘s Necronomicon about its properties,
and about the relation of ghouls‘ souls to the objects it symbolised; and were disturbed by
what we read. Then terror came.
On the night of September 24, 19––, I heard a knock at my chamber door. Fancying it St.
John‘s, I bade the knocker enter, but was answered only by a shrill laugh. There was no one
in the corridor. When I aroused St. John from his sleep, he professed entire ignorance of the
event, and became as worried as I. It was that night that the faint, distant baying over the
moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality. Four days later, whilst we were both in the
hidden museum, there came a low, cautious scratching at the single door which led to the
secret library staircase. Our alarm was now divided, for besides our fear of the unknown, we
had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered. Extinguishing
all lights, we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open; whereupon we felt an
unaccountable rush of air, and heard as if receding far away a queer combination of rustling,
tittering, and articulate chatter. Whether we were mad, dreaming, or in our senses, we did not
try to determine. We only realised, with the blackest of apprehensions, that the apparently
disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the Dutch language.
After that we lived in growing horror and fascination. Mostly we held to the theory that we
were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements, but sometimes it pleased us
more to dramatise ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom. Bizarre
manifestations were now too frequent to count. Our lonely house was seemingly alive with the
presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess, and every night that
daemoniac baying rolled over the windswept moor, always louder and louder. On October 29
we found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly
impossible to describe. They were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the
old manor-house in unprecedented and increasing numbers.
The horror reached a culmination on November 18, when St. John, walking home after dark
from the distant railway station, was seized by some frightful carnivorous thing and torn to
ribbons. His screams had reached the house, and I had hastened to the terrible scene in time
to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising
moon. My friend was dying when I spoke to him, and he could not answer coherently. All he
could do was to whisper, ―The amulet—that damned thing—.‖ Then he collapsed, an inert
mass of mangled flesh.
I buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens, and mumbled over his body
one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life. And as I pronounced the last daemoniac
sentence I heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound. The moon was up,
but I dared not look at it. And when I saw on the dim-litten moor a wide nebulous shadow
sweeping from mound to mound, I shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the
ground. When I arose trembling, I know not how much later, I staggered into the house and
made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade.
Being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, I departed on the following
day for London, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the
impious collection in the museum. But after three nights I heard the baying again, and before
a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark. One evening as I strolled
on Victoria Embankment for some needed air, I saw a black shape obscure one of the
reflections of the lamps in the water. A wind stronger than the night-wind rushed by, and I
knew that what had befallen St. John must soon befall me.
The next day I carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for Holland. What mercy I
might gain by returning the thing to its silent, sleeping owner I knew not; but I felt that I must
at least try any step conceivably logical. What the hound was, and why it pursued me, were
questions still vague; but I had first heard the baying in that ancient churchyard, and every
subsequent event including St. John‘s dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the
stealing of the amulet. Accordingly I sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when, at an
inn in Rotterdam, I discovered that thieves had despoiled me of this sole means of salvation.
The baying was loud that evening, and in the morning I read of a nameless deed in the vilest
quarter of the city. The rabble were in terror, for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death
beyond the foulest previous crime of the neighbourhood. In a squalid thieves‘ den an entire
family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left no trace, and those around had
heard all night above the usual clamour of drunken voices a faint, deep, insistent note as of a
gigantic hound.
So at last I stood again in that unwholesome churchyard where a pale winter moon cast
hideous shadows, and leafless trees drooped sullenly to meet the withered, frosty grass and
cracking slabs, and the ivied church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky, and the
night-wind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas. The baying was very
faint now, and it ceased altogether as I approached the ancient grave I had once violated, and
frightened away an abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around
it.
I know not why I went thither unless to pray, or gibber out insane pleas and apologies to the
calm white thing that lay within; but, whatever my reason, I attacked the half-frozen sod with a
desperation partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself. Excavation was
much easier than I expected, though at one point I encountered a queer interruption; when a
lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave-earth until I
killed him with a blow of my spade. Finally I reached the rotting oblong box and removed the
damp nitrous cover. This is the last rational act I ever performed.
For crouched within that centuried coffin, embraced by a close-packed nightmare retinue of
huge, sinewy, sleeping bats, was the bony thing my friend and I had robbed; not clean and
placid as we had seen it then, but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and
hair, and leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp ensanguined fangs
yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom. And when it gave from those grinning
jaws a deep, sardonic bay as of some gigantic hound, and I saw that it held in its gory, filthy
claw the lost and fateful amulet of green jade, I merely screamed and ran away idiotically, my
screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical laughter.
Madness rides the star-wind . . . claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of corpses . . .
dripping death astride a Bacchanale of bats from night-black ruins of buried temples of Belial.
. . . Now, as the baying of that dead, fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and the
stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web-wings circles closer and closer, I shall
seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable.

The Lurking Fear
(1922)
I. The Shadow on the Chimney
There was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted mansion atop Tempest
Mountain to find the lurking fear. I was not alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with
that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for
strange horrors in literature and in life. With me were two faithful and muscular men for whom
I had sent when the time came; men long associated with me in my ghastly explorations
because of their peculiar fitness.
We had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still lingered about after
the eldritch panic of a month before—the nightmare creeping death. Later, I thought, they
might aid me; but I did not want them then. Would to God I had let them share the search,
that I might not have had to bear the secret alone so long; to bear it alone for fear the world
would call me mad or go mad itself at the daemon implications of the thing. Now that I am
telling it anyway, lest the brooding make me a maniac, I wish I had never concealed it. For I,
and I only, know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountain.
In a small motor-car we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill until the wooded ascent
checked it. The country bore an aspect more than usually sinister as we viewed it by night
and without the accustomed crowds of investigators, so that we were often tempted to use the
acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract. It was not a wholesome landscape
after dark, and I believe I would have noticed its morbidity even had I been ignorant of the
terror that stalked there. Of wild creatures there were none—they are wise when death leers
close. The ancient lightning-scarred trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted, and the
other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish, while curious mounds and hummocks in the
weedy, fulgurite-pitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead men‘s skulls swelled to gigantic
proportions.
Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I learned at once from
newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world‘s notice.
The place is a remote, lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilisation
once feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a few ruined
mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes.
Normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed, and even now only
infrequent troopers patrol it. The fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring
villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes
leave their valleys to trade hand-woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot
shoot, raise, or make.
The lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion, which crowned the
high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent thunderstorms gave it the name of
Tempest Mountain. For over a hundred years the antique, grove-circled stone house had
been the subject of stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a silent colossal
creeping death which stalked abroad in summer. With whimpering insistence the squatters
told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or
leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered
of blood-trails toward the distant mansion. Some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of
its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice.
No one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting stories, with their
incoherent, extravagant descriptions of the half-glimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager
doubted that the Martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted. Local history forbade such a
doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the
building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of
the Martense spectre; myths concerning the Martense family itself, its queer hereditary
dissimilarity of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the murder which had cursed it.
The terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the
mountaineers‘ wildest legends. One summer night, after a thunderstorm of unprecedented
violence, the countryside was aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could
create. The pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror which had
descended upon them, and they were not doubted. They had not seen it, but had heard such
cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had come.
In the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering mountaineers to the place
where they said the death had come. Death was indeed there. The ground under one of the
squatters‘ villages had caved in after a lightning stroke, destroying several of the malodorous
shanties; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation which
paled it to insignificance. Of a possible 75 natives who had inhabited this spot, not one living
specimen was visible. The disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris
bespeaking too vividly the ravages of daemon teeth and talons; yet no visible trail led away
from the carnage. That some hideous animal must be the cause, everyone quickly agreed;
nor did any tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid
murders common in decadent communities. That charge was revived only when about 25 of
the estimated population were found missing from the dead; and even then it was hard to
explain the murder of fifty by half that number. But the fact remained that on a summer night a
bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose corpses were horribly
mangled, chewed, and clawed.
The excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted Martense
mansion, though the localities were over three miles apart. The troopers were more sceptical;
including the mansion only casually in their investigations, and dropping it altogether when
they found it thoroughly deserted. Country and village people, however, canvassed the place
with infinite care; overturning everything in the house, sounding ponds and brooks, beating
down bushes, and ransacking the nearby forests. All was in vain; the death that had come
had left no trace save destruction itself.
By the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the newspapers, whose
reporters overran Tempest Mountain. They described it in much detail, and with many
interviews to elucidate the horror‘s history as told by local grandams. I followed the accounts
languidly at first, for I am a connoisseur in horrors; but after a week I detected an atmosphere
which stirred me oddly, so that on August 5th, 1921, I registered among the reporters who
crowded the hotel at Lefferts Corners, nearest village to Tempest Mountain and
acknowledged headquarters of the searchers. Three weeks more, and the dispersal of the
reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the minute inquiries and
surveying with which I had meanwhile busied myself.
So on this summer night, while distant thunder rumbled, I left a silent motor-car and tramped
with two armed companions up the last mound-covered reaches of Tempest Mountain,
casting the beams of an electric torch on the spectral grey walls that began to appear through
giant oaks ahead. In this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting illumination, the vast box-
like pile displayed obscure hints of terror which day could not uncover; yet I did not hesitate,
since I had come with fierce resolution to test an idea. I believed that the thunder called the
death-daemon out of some fearsome secret place; and be that daemon solid entity or
vaporous pestilence, I meant to see it.
I had thoroughly searched the ruin before, hence knew my plan well; choosing as the seat of
my vigil the old room of Jan Martense, whose murder looms so great in the rural legends. I
felt subtly that the apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes. The chamber,
measuring about twenty feet square, contained like the other rooms some rubbish which had
once been furniture. It lay on the second story, on the southeast corner of the house, and had
an immense east window and narrow south window, both devoid of panes or shutters.
Opposite the large window was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing
the prodigal son, and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into the wall.
As the tree-muffled thunder grew louder, I arranged my plan‘s details. First I fastened side by
side to the ledge of the large window three rope ladders which I had brought with me. I knew
they reached a suitable spot on the grass outside, for I had tested them. Then the three of us
dragged from another room a wide four-poster bedstead, crowding it laterally against the
window. Having strown it with fir boughs, all now rested on it with drawn automatics, two
relaxing while the third watched. From whatever direction the daemon might come, our
potential escape was provided. If it came from within the house, we had the window ladders; if
from outside, the door and the stairs. We did not think, judging from precedent, that it would
pursue us far even at worst.
I watched from midnight to one o‘clock, when in spite of 

ngeu novamente.
Ela lhe disse que estava saindo de uma loja de
conveniências e o cara tinha chegado nela, o grandalhão,
perguntou direto quando custava, o que a deixou
envergonhada, mas respondeu assim mesmo e foram em
frente. Então entraram no carro dele, que era velho e
grande e cheirava a mofo
(detalhe retirado de seus dias em Cleveland), e que ele a
jogou sobre o assento.– Em frente à lojinha?
– Nos fundos.
Eddy nunca a acusava de inventar nada, mesmo que ela
soubesse que foi ele quem tinha lhe ensinado aquela
história em linhas gerais e que, basicamente, era sempre
a mesma. No momento em
que o grandalhão tinha erguido a saia dela (a preta,
disse, e eu estava com minhas botas brancas) e tinha
abaixado as calças, ela pôde ouvir o barulho da fivela do
cinto de Eddy, que estava tirando o seu jeans. Uma parte
dela estava se perguntando, quando ele se deitou na
cama ao seu lado, se a posição que estava descrevendo
era fisicamente possível, mas prosseguiu e, de qualquer
forma, estava funcionando com Eddy. Lembrou-se de
explicar como machucava, quando o cara estava
metendo, mesmo que já estivesse toda molhada. Deu os
detalhes sobre como ele havia segurado seus pulsos,
embora estivesse agora bastante confusa sobre o que
estava onde, mas sabia que sua bunda estava virada
para cima. Eddy começou a tocá-la, acariciando seus
seios e a barriga, então ela passou da brutalidade do
cliente para como ele supostamente fez com que ela se
sentisse.
Como supostamente tinha feito com que ela se sentisse
era como nunca havia se sentido. Ela sabia que tinha um
ponto em que trepar doía um pouco mas continuava
sendo bom, mas sabia que não
era aquilo. O que Eddy queria ouvir é que doía muito e
ela se sentia mal, mas gostava mesmo assim.Isso não fazia o menor sentido para Mona, mas tinha
aprendido a dizer o que ele queria.
Porque desse jeito funcionava e Eddy se virou com o
cobertor sobre as suas costas e meteu entre
as suas pernas. Pensou que ele deveria estar vendo tudo
em sua mente, como um desenho animado, as coisas
que estava contando para ele e que, ao mesmo tempo,
ele se tornava o grandalhão sem rosto
metendo fundo. Estava segurando os pulsos dela presos
sobre a cabeça, do jeito que ele gostava.
E quando ele terminou, curvado do seu lado, dormindo,
Mona ficou ali, deitada e acordada na
escuridão, revirando o sonho de partir, brilhante e
maravilhoso.
E, por favor, que fosse verdade.

PORTOBELLO
Kumiko acordou na cama enorme e ficou deitada, bem
quieta, escutando. Havia um murmúrio
contínuo de trânsito distante.
O ar do quarto era frio; enrolou o edredom rosa em torno
do corpo, como uma túnica, e saltou
da cama. As janelas, pequenas, estavam cobertas por
uma brilhante camada de gelo. Foi até a banheira e girou
uma das asas douradas do cisne. O pássaro tossiu,
gargarejou, começou a encher a banheira.Ainda envolta na coberta, abriu as malas e começou a
escolher as roupas do dia, estendendo as peças
escolhidas sobre a cama.
Quando seu banho estava pronto, deixou a coberta
escorregar no chão e subiu sobre o parapeito
de mármore, entrando estoicamente na água escaldante.
O vapor da banheira havia derretido o gelo; agora, as
janelas escorriam com a condensação. Será que todos os
quartos britânicos tinham banheiras como esta? –
pensou. Ensaboou-se metodicamente com um sabonete
francês de formato oval, levantou-se, enxaguou a
espuma o melhor que pôde, envolveu-se numa enorme
toalha preta e,
depois de procurar um pouco, descobriu uma pia, um
vaso sanitário e um bidê. Estavam escondidos
num cômodo muito pequeno que um dia devia ter sido
um closet, suas paredes cobertas de verniz escuro.
O telefone de aparência teatral tocou duas vezes.
– Sim?
– Aqui é Petal. Aceita um café da manhã? Roger está
aqui. Ansioso por encontrá-la.
– Obrigada – respondeu. – Estou me vestindo agora.
Vestiu sua calça de couro melhor e mais larga, depois
enfiou-se num blusão de lã azul tão largo
que poderia caber facilmente em Petal. Quando abriu a
bolsa para procurar sua maquiagem, viu a unidade Maas-
Neotek. Sua mão apertou-a automaticamente. Nãopretendia invocá-lo, mas seu toque foi o bastante: ele
estava lá, virando seu pescoço comicamente e olhando,
perplexo, para o teto, baixo e espelhado.
– Presumo que não estejamos no Dorchester?
– Eu faço as perguntas – disse ela. – Que lugar é este?
– Um quarto. De gosto um tanto duvidoso.
– Responda à minha pergunta, por favor.
– Bem – disse ele, flutuando entre a cama e a banheira –,
pela decoração, poderia ser um bordel.
Posso acessar os dados históricos sobre a maior parte
das construções em Londres, mas não há nada de
especial sobre esta aqui. Construída em 1848. Sólido
exemplo do predomínio do estilo vitoriano clássico. A
vizinhança é cara, sem estar na moda, popular entre
advogados de um certo renome. –
Sacudiu os ombros; ela podia ver o canto da cama
através do brilho queimado de suas botas de cowboy.
Jogou a unidade dentro da bolsa e ele desapareceu.
***
Conseguiu manejar o elevador com bastante facilidade.
Uma vez no vestíbulo pintado de branco,
seguiu o som das vozes. Ao longo de um corredor.
Virando em uma esquina.
– Bom dia – disse Petal, erguendo a tampa prateada de
uma bandeja. Uma nuvem de vapor subiu.– Aqui está o evasivo sr. Swain, Roger para você, e aqui
está o seu café da manhã.
– Olá – disse o homem, aproximando-se com a mão
estendida. Olhos claros num rosto
comprido e ossudo. O cabelo escorrido, castanho-claro,
estava penteado diagonalmente sobre sua testa. Kumiko
não soube adivinhar a sua idade; era o rosto de um
homem jovem, mas havia rugas profundas sob seus
olhos acinzentados. Era alto, com braços e ombros de
atleta. – Bem-vinda a Londres. – Pegou a mão dela,
apertou-a e largou-a.
– Obrigada.
Ele vestia uma camisa sem colarinho, listras vermelhas
muito finas contra um fundo azul-claro,
os punhos fechados por abotoaduras de um dourado sem
brilho; aberta no pescoço, revelava um triângulo negro
de pele tatuada. – Falei com seu pai esta manhã, disse
que você havia chegado em segurança.
– Você é um homem de alta hierarquia.
Os olhos claros se aguçaram. – Como?
– Os dragões.
Petal riu.
– Deixe-a comer – disse alguém, uma voz de mulher.
Kumiko virou-se, notando uma mulher esguia e escura
contra altas janelas recortadas em painéis, como um
vitral; para além das janelas, um jardim murado, cobertode neve. Os olhos da mulher estavam ocultos por óculos
prateados, que refletiam o cômodo e seus ocupantes.
– Outra de nossas convidadas – disse Petal.
– Sally – apresentou-se a mulher – Sally Shears. Coma,
querida. Se você estiver tão entediada quanto eu, vai
sentir vontade de dar uma caminhada. – Enquanto
Kumiko a observava, ela levantou a mão para tocar os
óculos, como se fosse tirá-los. – Portobello Road fica a
poucos quarteirões.
Preciso de um pouco de ar. – As lentes espelhadas
pareciam não ter armação, nem hastes.
– Roger – falou Petal, pegando, com o garfo, pedaços
rosados de bacon de uma bandeja de prata
–, você acha que Kumiko estará segura com nossa Sally?
– Mais segura do que eu estaria, levando-se em conta o
humor dela – disse Swain. – Lamento dizer que não há
muito aqui para entretê-la – disse a Kumiko, conduzindo-
a para a mesa –, mas tentaremos fazer com que você se
sinta o mais confortável possível e planejar para que veja
um pouco da cidade. Não é Tóquio, contudo.
– Pelo menos não, por enquanto – disse Petal, mas Swain
pareceu não ouvir.
– Obrigada – disse Kumiko, enquanto Swain segurava sua
cadeira.
– Uma honra – respondeu Swain. – Nosso respeito por seu
pai...– Ei! – disse a mulher. – Ela é jovem demais para precisar
dessa babaquice. Poupe-nos.
– Sally está ligeiramente mal-humorada, como você pode
ver – disse Petal, enquanto servia um
ovo frito no prato de Kumiko.
***
O humor de Sally Shears, como se tornou claro mais
tarde, era como uma raiva contida por um
fio, uma fúria que se fazia notar em suas passadas, no
ruído furioso dos saltos de suas botas negras sobre o
calçamento gelado.
Kumiko tinha que apertar o passo para acompanhá-la,
enquanto a mulher se afastava da casa de
Swain, os óculos brilhando friamente na luz sem direção
do inverno. Ela vestia calças justas de camurça marrom-
escura e uma jaqueta preta larga, com a lapela
levantada: roupas caras. Com seu cabelo negro curto,
poderia ser confundida com um garoto.
Pela primeira vez desde que deixara Tóquio, Kumiko
sentiu medo.
A energia presa na mulher era quase tangível, um nó de
raiva que poderia se desfazer a qualquer
momento.
Kumiko escorregou sua mão para dentro da bolsa e
apertou a unidade Maas-Neotek. Colin apareceuinstantaneamente ao seu lado, acompanhando seu
passo, suas mãos enfiadas nos bolsos da
jaqueta, botas pisando a neve suja sem deixar qualquer
traço. Soltou a unidade e ele desapareceu, mas sentiu-se
mais segura. Não precisava ter medo de se perder de
Sally Shears, cujo passo era difícil de acompanhar; o
fantasma certamente poderia guiá-la de volta para a
casa de Swain. E se eu fugir dela, pensou, ele me
ajudará. A mulher esgueirou-se em meio ao tráfego num
cruzamento, puxando automaticamente Kumiko para fora
do caminho de um táxi Honda preto e, de algum modo,
dando um
jeito de chutar o para-choque quando o veículo passou.
– Você bebe? – perguntou, sua mão segurando o
antebraço de Kumiko.
Kumiko sacudiu a cabeça. – Por favor, você está
machucando meu braço.
Sally relaxou um pouco a pegada, mas Kumiko foi
conduzida por portas de vidro ornado para
dentro do barulho e do calor, um lugar cavernoso, cheio
de gente, revestido de madeira escura e de uma
camurça castanho-clara desgastada.
Logo estavam frente a frente numa mesinha de mármore
sobre a qual havia um cinzeiro com a
marca da cerveja Bass, uma caneca de chope escuro, o
copo de uísque que Sally havia esvaziado voltando do
bar e um suco de laranja.Kumiko viu que as lentes prateadas encontravam a pele
clara sem qualquer sinal de junção.
Sally pegou o copo de uísque vazio, inclinou-o sem
erguê-lo da mesa e observou-o
compenetradamente. – Encontrei seu pai uma vez –
disse. – Não era tão poderoso naquela época. –
Largou o copo para tomar a cerveja. – Swain diz que você
é metade gaijin. Diz que sua mãe era dinamarquesa. –
Tomou um gole. – Não parece.
– Ela fez com que trocassem meus olhos.
– Combinam com você.
– Obrigada. E suas lentes – disse, automaticamente –,
são muito bonitas.
Sally deu de ombros. – Seu velho já levou você a Chiba?
Kumiko sacudiu a cabeça, fazendo que não.
– Esperto. Se fosse ele, também não levaria. – Bebeu
mais cerveja. Suas unhas, evidentemente acrílicas, eram
do tom e tinham o brilho de madrepérola. – Me contaram
sobre a sua mãe. – Com o
rosto ardendo, Kumiko baixou os olhos.
– Não é por isso que você está aqui, sabia? Ele não a
enviou para Swain por causa dela. Há uma
guerra em andamento. Não houve nenhum conflito no
alto escalão da Yakuza desde antes que eu nascesse,
mas agora está havendo um. – O copo vazio tiniu quando
Sally o largou na mesa. – Ele não pode ficar com você porlá, é só isso. Seria uma presa fácil. Um cara como o
Swain está bem longe no mapa, pelo menos no que diz
respeito aos rivais de Kanaka. Por isso você tem um
passaporte com um nome diferente, certo? Swain está
em débito com Kanaka. Então você está ok, certo?
Kumiko sentiu as lágrimas quentes surgirem.
– Ok, então você não está ok. – As unhas de pérola
tamborilaram no mármore. – Então, ela deu
cabo de si mesma e você não está ok. Sente-se culpada,
certo?
Kumiko fixou o olhar nos espelhos gêmeos.
***
Portobello estava entulhada de turistas, tão cheia quanto
em Shinjuku. Sally Shears, depois de insistir que Kumiko
bebesse a laranjada, que tinha ficado quente e insípida,
guiou-a para a rua entupida de gente. Puxando Kumiko
com firmeza, Sally começou a abrir caminho pela
calçada, passando por mesas dobráveis de aço
recobertas com cortinas de veludo rasgadas e milhares
de objetos feitos de prata e cristal, bronze e porcelana.
Kumiko olhava atentamente enquanto Sally a guiava
pelas pilhas de prataria para colecionadores e chaleiras
Churchill.
– Isto é gomi – arriscou Kumiko, quando pararam no
cruzamento. Lixo. Em Tóquio, objetos gastos e inúteis
viravam material para aterros. Sally sorriu, manhosa. –
Isto é a Inglaterra. Gomi é um grande recurso natural.
Gomi e profissionais. Justamente o que eu estou
procurando agora.Profissionais.
***
O profissional em questão vestia um terno de veludo
verde-escuro com lapelas impecáveis de camurça e Sally
encontrou-o em outro pub, chamado Rose and Crown.
Apresentou-o como Tick. Era
um pouco mais alto que Kumiko e alguma coisa estava
torta em suas costas ou quadris, fazendo com
que mancasse fortemente, o que piorava a impressão de
assimetria. Seu cabelo preto era rapado na
nuca e nos lados, mas se acumulava numa pilha de
cachos oleosos sobre a testa.
Sally apresentou Kumiko – Minha amiga do Japão, e
mantenha suas mãos longe dela. – Tick deu
um sorriso cansado e levou-as até uma mesa.
– Como vão os negócios, Tick?
– Bem – respondeu,
aposentadoria?
tristonho.
–
Como
vai
a
Sally sentou-se num banco estofado, as costas apoiadas
na parede. – Um pouco como – disse ela
– voltar, parar, voltar de novo.
Kumiko a olhou. A raiva tinha evaporado, ou talvez
tivesse sido camuflada com habilidade.
Enquanto Kumiko se sentava, escorregou a mão para
dentro da bolsa e encontrou a unidade. Colin apareceuno banco ao lado de Sally.
– Legal da sua parte se lembrar de mim – disse Tick,
pegando uma cadeira. – Já se passaram dois anos, eu
diria. – Ele ergueu uma sobrancelha na direção de
Kumiko.
– Tudo limpo com ela. Você conhece Swain, Tick?
– Apenas pela reputação, obrigado.
Colin estava estudando aquela interação, completamente
entretido e fascinado, movendo a cabeça de um lado
para outro como se estivesse assistindo a uma partida de
tênis. Kumiko tinha que se lembrar de que era a única
que podia vê-lo.
– Eu quero que você o investigue para mim. Não quero
que ele saiba.
Tick encarou-a. Todo o lado esquerdo de seu rosto
contorceu-se numa longa piscadela. – Tudo
bem – respondeu. – Você não quer quase nada, não é?
– Boa grana, cara. A melhor.
– Procurando por alguma coisa em particular, ou é uma
lavagem? Todo mundo sabe que é um
figurão do crime organizado. Vou dizer que não queria
que ele me encontrasse em sua mansão...
– É onde entra o dinheiro, Tick.
Duas piscadas rápidas.– Roger está me enganando, Tick. Alguém está
enganando ele. Não sei o que os outros têm contra ele,
nem me importo. O que ele tem contra mim já basta. O
que quero saber é quem, onde, quando. Intercepta o
tráfego interno e externo. Ele está em contato com
alguém, porque o acordo muda o tempo todo.
– Eu reconheceria se visse?
– Basta dar uma olhada, Tick. Faz isso por mim.
A piscada convulsiva novamente. – Beleza, então. Vamos
nessa. – Tamborilou os dedos
nervosamente no canto da mesa. – Paga uma rodada?
Colin olhou para Kumiko do outro lado da mesa e revirou
os olhos.
***
– Não entendo – disse Kumiko, enquanto seguia Sally de
volta para Portobello Road. – Você acabou de me
envolver numa intriga...
Sally ergueu a lapela para se proteger do vento.
– Mas eu poderia traí-la. Você está tramando contra um
sócio de meu pai. Não tem nenhuma razão para confiar
em mim.
– Nem você em mim, querida. Talvez eu seja uma
daquelas pessoas malvadas com quem seu pai
está preocupado.
Kumiko considerou a ideia. – Você é?– Não. E, se você fosse uma espiã do Swain, ele estaria
usando métodos bem exóticos. Se você é
uma espiã do seu velho, talvez eu não precise de Tick.
Mas se é a própria Yakuza que está rodando a coisa toda,
qual o objetivo de usar Roger como proteção?
– Não sou espiã.
– Melhor passar a ser sua própria espiã, então. Se Tóquio
é a frigideira, você pode ter caído no
fogo.
– E por que me envolver?
– Você já está envolvida. Você está aqui. Dá medo?
– Não – disse Kumiko, e ficou em silêncio, pensando por
que aquilo seria verdade.
***
No final daquela tarde, sozinha no sótão espelhado,
Kumiko sentou-se na beira da enorme cama
e tirou suas botas úmidas. Pegou a unidade Maas-Neotek
na bolsa.
– O que são eles? – perguntou ao fantasma, que pairava
sobre o parapeito da banheira de mármore negro.
– Seus amigos do pub?
– Sim.
– Criminosos. De minha parte, recomendaria procurar
melhores companhias. A mulher éestrangeira. Americana. O homem é londrino. Do East
End. É um ladrão de dados, evidentemente.
Não tenho acesso aos registros policiais, exceto se forem
crimes de interesse histórico.
– Não sei o que fazer...
– Vire a unidade de cabeça para baixo.
– O quê?
– Na parte traseira. Vai encontrar uma meia-lua. Coloque
o polegar ali e gire...
Uma pequena portinhola se abriu. Microinterruptores.
– Reconfigure o interruptor A/B para a posição B. Use
alguma coisa estreita, pontuda, mas não
uma esferográfica.
– Uma o quê?
– Uma caneta. Tinta e poeira. Fica tudo sujo. Um palito de
dentes seria ideal. Isto vai programar a unidade para
gravação ativada por voz.
– E depois?
– Esconda-a lá embaixo. Ouviremos amanhã.
6
LUZ DA MANHÃ
Slick passou a noite num pedaço de espuma cinza gasta
embaixo de uma bancada no térreo daFábrica, envolto numa barulhenta folha de plástico-bolha
que fedia a monômeros livres. Sonhou com Kid Afrika,
com o carro de Kid, e, em seus sonhos, os dois se
tornaram indistintos e os dentes de Kid eram pequenas
caveiras cromadas.
Ele acordou com o vento cortante cuspindo a primeira
neve de inverno através das janelas vazadas da Fábrica.
Ficou deitado lá e pensou sobre o problema da serra
circular do Juiz, de como o pulso tinha tendência de
travar quando tentava cortar algo mais denso do que
uma folha de papelão. Seu plano
original para a mão havia previsto dedos articulados,
cada um com uma miniserra elétrica nas pontas, mas o
conceito se perdeu devido a inúmeras razões.
Eletricidade, de algum modo, simplesmente não bastava:
não era suficientemente físico. Ar era a saída, grandes
tanques de ar comprimido, ou combustão interna, se
fosse possível encontrar as peças. Era possível encontrar
peças para quase tudo em Dog Solitude, se você
procurasse por um bom tempo; se não desse certo,
havia uma penca de cidades, no cinturão da ferrugem
em torno de Jersey, onde havia acres de máquinas
mortas para escolher.
Saiu de debaixo da mesa, arrastando atrás de si o
cobertor transparente de travesseiros plásticos em
miniatura, como uma capa. Pensou sobre o cara na
maca, lá em cima, no seu quarto, e sobre Cherry, que
tinha dormido na cama dele. Ela não estaria com um
torcicolo. Espreguiçou-se e gemeu.
Gentry ia chegar a qualquer momento. Tinha que explicar
aquilo tudo para Gentry, que não gostava nem um poucode ter gente por perto.
***
Little Bird tinha feito café no cômodo que servia como
cozinha da Fábrica. O chão era feito de
lajotas de plástico recurvadas e havia pias de inox fosco
ao longo de uma parede. As janelas estavam cobertas
com telas transparentes que eram alternadamente
sugadas e insufladas pelo vento, deixando passar um
brilho leitoso que fazia o cômodo parecer ainda mais frio
do que era.
– Como estamos de água? – perguntou Slick ao entrar.
Uma das tarefas de Little Bird era checar
os tanques no telhado todas as manhãs, retirando as
folhas trazidas pelo vento ou um eventual corvo morto.
Depois, tinha de checar a vedação dos filtros, talvez
deixar entrar uns 50 litros de água, se estivessem em
baixa. Levava boa parte do dia para os 50 litros serem
filtrados pelo sistema até o tanque de armazenamento. O
fato de Little Bird cuidar disso rigorosamente era a
principal razão para que Gentry o tolerasse, mas a
timidez do garoto provavelmente ajudava. Little Bird
dava um jeito de permanecer invisível aos olhos de
Gentry.
– Tá cheio – disse Little Bird.
– Tem como tomar um banho? – perguntou Cherry, de
seu assento improvisado num velho engradado de
plástico. Tinha uma sombra embaixo dos olhos, como se
não tivesse dormido, mas havia coberto o machucado
com maquiagem.– Não – respondeu Slick. – Não dá, nesta época do ano.
– É, foi o que pensei – disse Cherry, mal-humorada,
contraída em sua coleção de jaquetas de couro.
Slick pegou o que tinha sobrado do café e ficou em pé na
frente dela, enquanto bebia.
– Algo de errado contigo? – ela perguntou.
– Sim. Você e o cara lá em cima. Por que você está aqui
embaixo? Está de folga ou algo assim?
Ela tirou um pager preto do bolso da jaqueta que estava
por cima de todas as outras. – Se algo
mudar, isto dispara.
– Dormiu bem?
– É, o suficiente.
– Eu não. Há quanto tempo você trabalha para Kid Afrika,
Cherry?
– Uma semana, por aí.
– Você é mesmo uma med-tec?
Ela encolheu os ombros dentro das jaquetas. – O
bastante para poder cuidar do Conde.
– Conde?
– Conde, isso aí. Foi como Kid o chamou, uma vez.
Little Bird estremeceu. Não tinha modelado seu cabelo
ainda, então estava arrepiado em todas asdireções. – E se – começou a falar Little Bird – ele for um
vampiro?
Ela o encarou – Está brincando?
Olhos arregalados,
solenemente.
Little
Bird
sacudiu
a
cabeça
Ela se voltou para Slick. – Seu amigo é pirado?
– Sem vampiros – Slick falou para Little Bird –, não são
reais, entende? Só existem lá nos stims.
O cara não é vampiro, ok?
Little Bird assentiu vagarosamente, parecendo não estar
muito convencido, enquanto o vento inflava a cobertura
de plástico contra a luz leitosa.
***
Ele tentou aproveitar a manhã para trabalhar no Juiz,
mas Little Bird tinha desaparecido de novo
e a imagem da figura na maca ficava surgindo dentro de
sua cabeça. Estava frio demais, precisava pegar uma
linha elétrica lá no território de Gentry e trazer até o alto
da Fábrica, conseguir alguns aquecedores. Mas isso
significava negociar com Gentry sobre a energia. A força
era dele porque Gentry sabia como roubar a eletricidade
do Departamento de Fissão sem que percebessem.
Aquele seria o terceiro inverno de Slick na Fábrica, mas
Gentry já estava lá há quatro anos quando Slick chegou.
Quando tinham conseguido colocar de pé o loft de
Gentry, Slick herdou o quarto onde havia colocado Cherrye o homem que ela disse que Kid Afrika chamava de
Conde. Na
visão de Gentry, a Fábrica era dele, porque tinha
chegado primeiro e conseguido trazer energia elétrica
sem que o Departamento ficasse sabendo. Mas Slick
cuidava de muitas coisas na Fábrica que Gentry não
gostaria de fazer por conta própria, como garantir que
houvesse comida e, se algo sério quebrasse, se a fiação
entrasse em curto ou se o filtro da água entupisse, era
Slick quem tinha as ferramentas e quem fazia o conserto.
Gentry não gostava de pessoas. Passava dias com seus
consoles e órgãos FX e projetores holográficos e aparecia
somente quando ficava com fome. Slick não entendia o
que Gentry estava tentando fazer, mas invejava o foco
limitado de sua obsessão. Nada irritava o Gentry. Kid
Afrika não conseguiria irritar o Gentry, porque Gentry não
teria ido a Atlantic City, nem se metido numa grande
merda, nem ficado em dívida com Kid.
***
Entrou em seu quarto sem bater e Cherry estava lavando
o peito do cara com uma esponja, usando luvas
descartáveis brancas. Ela tinha levado para cima o fogão
de butano em que cozinhavam e aquecera água numa
bacia de aço.
Ele se obrigou a olhar o rosto contraído, os lábios
frouxos, entreabertos apenas o suficiente para revelar
dentes amarelados de fumante. Era um rosto das ruas,
um rosto da multidão, um desses que você veria em um
bar por aí.
Ela olhou para o Slick.Ele se sentou no canto da cama, onde ela havia aberto o
zíper do saco de dormir e estendido-o
como um cobertor, com o canto rasgado dobrado por
baixo da espuma.
– Temos de conversar, Cherry. Resolver essa coisa, sabe?
Ela espremeu a esponja sobre a bacia.
– Como você se meteu com Kid Afrika?
Ela colocou a esponja num invólucro de plástico e
guardou-a na sacola de nylon preta do hover
de Kid. Enquanto a observava, ele viu que não havia um
movimento desperdiçado, e ela parecia não
pensar no que estava fazendo. – Você conhece um lugar
chamado Moby Jane’s?
– Não.
– É um bar de beira de estrada, perto da interestadual.
Então, eu tinha um amigo, o gerente, estava por lá fazia
um mês quando fui morar com ele. Moby Jane é uma
mulher enorme, inacreditável; fica sentada lá no fundo
do clube, num tanque de flutuação com freebase
entrando por uma sonda intravenosa no braço dela,
totalmente nojento. Daí, como estava dizendo, me mudei
para
lá com meu amigo Spencer, ele é o novo gerente, porque
tive um problema com a minha licença em
Cleveland e não podia trabalhar naquela época.
– Que tipo de problema?– O de sempre, ok? Vai querer ouvir a história ou não?
Daí, Spencer me deixou a par da horrível condição da
proprietária, certo? Daí, a última coisa que eu queria que
qualquer um soubesse é que eu era uma med-tec,
porque do contrário teriam me colocado lá trocando os
filtros do tanque dela e injetando freebase dentro de
duzentos quilos de psicótica alucinada. Daí, me
colocaram para atender mesas e servir cerveja. Era legal,
tinha boa música lá. Um lugar meio grosseiro, mas eu
não tinha problemas porque as pessoas sabiam que
estava com Spencer. Exceto um dia, quando acordei,
Spencer tinha sumido. Depois descobriram que ele tinha
fugido e levado um monte de dinheiro. – Ela secava o
peito do paciente enquanto falava, usando uma bucha
grossa de fibra absorvente. – Então, me deram uma dura.
– Olhou para ele e sacudiu os ombros. – Daí foi quando
me disseram o que pretendiam fazer. Iam algemar
minhas mãos nas costas e me colocar no tanque com
Moby Jane e colocar o dreno a toda, daí contar que o meu
namorado tinha roubado a grana dela... – Ela jogou a
bucha úmida dentro da bacia. – Então me trancaram num
closet para que eu pensasse a respeito antes de fazerem
isso. Quando a porta se abriu, contudo, era o Kid Afrika.
Nunca tinha visto o cara antes.
“Senhorita Chesterfield”, ele me disse, “tenho razões
para crer que você era, até recentemente, uma técnica
médica certificada.”
– Então ele lhe fez uma proposta.
– Proposta uma ova. Ele apenas conferiu meus papéis e
me levou direto para fora dali. Não havia uma alma por
lá, curiosamente, e era sábado à tarde. Me levou para o
estacionamento, ohovercraft estacionado lá, com as caveiras na frente, dois
caras negros bem grandes esperando por nós, e qualquer
saída para longe daquele tanque de flutuação, cara, por
mim tudo bem.
– Nosso amigo já estava na traseira?
– Não. – Tirando as luvas. – Me fez dirigir de volta a
Cleveland, até um subúrbio. Grandes casarões antigos,
mas os jardins estavam abandonados, a grama alta.
Fomos até um deles, com segurança reforçada, acho que
era dele. Este aqui – e ela fechou o saco de dormir até o
queixo do homem – estava num quarto. Tive que
começar imediatamente. Kid me disse que pagaria bem.
– E você sabia que viriam para cá, para Solitude?
– Não. Acho que nem ele sabia. Alguma coisa aconteceu.
Ele apareceu no dia seguinte dizendo
que estávamos de partida. Alguma coisa o assustou. Foi
quando ele o chamou assim, o Conde. Porque ele estava
nervoso e, talvez, meio apavorado. “O Conde e sua porra
de LF, ele disse.
– Sua o quê?
"LF"”.
– O que é isso?
– Isso aqui, acho – disse ela, apontando para o volume
completamente cinza, e sem nenhuma marcação,
montado sobre a cabeça do homem.
7NÃO HÁ NADA, LÁ
Imaginou Swift esperando-a no terraço, vestindo seu
terno de tweed favorito para o inverno de
Los Angeles, o colete e o casaco que não combinavam,
um em ziguezague, outro quadriculado, mas
ambos tecidos com a mesma lã, que provavelmente
provinha da mesma ovelha do mesmo lado da montanha,
sua aparência orquestrada em Londres, por um comitê,
numa sala sobre uma loja de Floral Street que ele nunca
tinha visto. Faziam camisas listradas para ele, traziam o
algodão de Charvet, em Paris; faziam suas gravatas com
seda criada em Osaka, o logo da Sense/Net em bordado
nítido e discreto. Ainda sim, de algum modo, parecia ter
sido vestido por sua mãe.
O terraço estava vazio. O Dornier pairou, depois voltou
para o seu canto. A presença de Mamman Brigitte ainda
se agarrava a ela.
Entrou na cozinha branca e esfregou o sangue seco do
rosto e das mãos. Quando entrou na sala,
foi como se estivesse vendo o lugar pela primeira vez. O
chão esbranquiçado, as armações douradas e o forro de
veludo das cadeiras Luís XVI, o fundo cubista de um
Valmier. Como o guarda-roupas de Hilton, pensou,
elaborado por desconhecidos talentosos. Suas botas
deixaram um rastro de areia pelo chão claro enquanto se
dirigia para a escada.
Kelly Hickman, responsável pelo seu vestuário, havia
passado pela casa enquanto ela estivera naclínica; havia arrumado sua bagagem de trabalho no
quarto principal. Nove valises Herm, tipo rifle, planas e
retangulares, como caixões de pele curtida e lustrada.
Suas roupas nunca eram dobradas; ficavam estendidas,
separadas por finas camadas de papel de seda.
Parou no batente da porta, encarando a cama vazia, os
nove caixões de couro.
Entrou no banheiro, blocos de vidro e cerâmica branca,
trancando a porta atrás de si. Abriu um
armário, depois outro, ignorando as fileiras organizadas
de produtos de higiene, remédios e cosméticos
intocados. Encontrou o carregador no terceiro armário,
ao lado de um envelope com bolhas de plástico que
continha dermas. Aproximou-se, examinando o plástico
cinza, o logotipo japonês, com medo de tocá-lo. O
carregador parecia novo, ainda sem ter sido usado.
Estava quase certa de que não o havia comprado, não o
havia deixado lá. Pegou a droga no bolso da sua jaqueta
e examinou-a, revirando-a várias vezes, observando as
doses de pó violeta separadas em seus compartimentos
selados.
Viu a si mesma enquanto colocava o pacote sobre a
bancada de mármore branco, posicionava o
carregador sobre a bancada, removia o derma de seu
invólucro plástico e o inseria. Viu a luz vermelha de um
diodo se acendendo quando o carregador extraiu uma
dose; viu a si mesma removendo o derma, balançando-o
como uma sanguessuga de plástico branco na ponta de
seu dedo
indicador, sua superfície interna úmida brilhando com
gotículas de DMSO.Virou-se, deu três passos em direção à privada e jogou o
pacote fechado lá dentro. Flutuou como uma canoa de
brinquedo,
a
droga
ainda
perfeitamente
seca.
Perfeitamente. Com sua mão tremendo, encontrou uma
lixa de unha em aço inox e se ajoelhou no piso branco.
Teve de fechar os
olhos quando segurou o pacote e espetou a ponta da lixa
na junção, arrebentando-a. A lixa caiu sobre o piso
quando acionou a descarga e as duas metades do pacote
vazio desapareceram. Recostou a testa contra a fria
cerâmica, depois se esforçou para se levantar, ir até a
pia e lavar cuidadosamente as mãos.
Porque queria, agora sabia que queria lamber seus
dedos.
***
Mais tarde, no mesmo dia, numa tarde cinza, encontrou
na garagem um cilindro de carga feito
de plástico ondulado, levou-o para o quarto e começou a
empacotar os pertences de Bobby que ficaram para trás.
Eram poucas coisas: uma calça de couro de que ele não
tinha gostado, algumas camisas que tinha esquecido e,
na gaveta de baixo da cômoda em madeira de teca, um
console de ciberespaço. Era um Ono-Sendai, pouco mais
que um brinquedo. Estava junto com um emaranhado
de cabos pretos, um conjunto barato de trodos de stim,
um tubo de plástico de pasta salina com aparência
engordurada.
Lembrava-se do console que ele costumava usar, aquele
que havia levado embora, um Hosakacinza, personalizado de fábrica, com teclas sem signos.
Era um console de cowboy, e ele insistia em viajar com
aquilo, mesmo que causasse problemas nas inspeções
alfandegárias. Por que, ela se perguntava, ele tinha
comprado o Ono-Sendai? E por que o tinha abandonado ?
Estava sentada na beirada da cama; retirou o console da
gaveta e colocou-o no colo.
Seu pai, há muito tempo, no Arizona, tinha dito a ela que
não se conectasse. Você não precisa,
dissera. E ela, de fato, não precisava, porque sonhava
com o ciberespaço, como se as linhas de neon da matrix
esperassem por ela atrás de suas pálpebras.
Não há nada, lá. Era o que ensinavam para as crianças,
para explicar o ciberespaço. Ela se lembrava da palestra
de um professor sorridente na creche executiva da
arcologia, imagens se alternando numa tela: pilotos com
capacetes enormes e luvas desengonçadas, a tecnologia
neuroeletrônica
primitiva
do
“mundo
virtual”
conectando-os mais efetivamente com seus aviões,
pares de terminais miniaturizados de vídeo alimentando-
os com o fluxo de dados de combate gerado
por computador, as luvas de retroalimentação vibrotáctil
oferecendo um universo táctil de botões e disparadores...
Conforme
a
tecnologia
evoluiu,
os
capacetes
encolheram, os terminais de vídeo se atrofiaram ...
Debruçou-se e pegou
desemaranhar seus fios.
o
console,
sacudiu-o
para
Não há nada, lá.
Esticou a faixa elástica e ajustou os trodos em volta de
suas têmporas – um dos gestos humanosmais característicos, mas que ela raras vezes executava.
Pressionou o botão de teste da bateria no Ono-Sendai.
Verde, pronto para usar. Tocou no botão de “ligar” e o
quarto desapareceu atrás de uma parede sem cor de
estática sensorial. Sua cabeça se encheu com uma
torrente de ruído branco.
Seus dedos encontraram um segundo botão e ela foi
lançada através da parede de estática, dentro
de uma vastidão desordenada, o vácuo nocional do
ciberespaço, a rede brilhante da matrix rangendo em sua
volta como uma gaiola infinita.
***
– Angela – disse a casa, em sua voz tranquila, mas firme
–, tenho uma chamada de Hilton Swift...
– Em prioridade executiva? – Estava comendo feijões
cozidos e torrada, no balcão da cozinha.
– Não – respondeu, com segurança.
– Mude seu tom – disse, com a boca cheia de feijões. –
Algo com um leve toque de ansiedade.
– O senhor Swift está esperando – disse a casa,
nervosamente.
– Melhor – falou, levando a tigela e o prato para a
lavadora –, mas queria algo mais próximo de
uma verdadeira histeria...
– Vai atender a ligação? – a voz estava engasgada de
tensão.– Não – disse ela –, mas mantenha a voz deste jeito, eu
gosto assim.
Caminhou pela sala, contando em silêncio. Doze, treze...
– Angela – disse a casa gentilmente –, há uma ligação de
Hilton Swift...
– Em prioridade executiva – completou Swift.
Ela fez um ruído de desdém com os lábios.
– Você sabe que respeito sua necessidade de estar
sozinha, mas estou preocupado.
– Estou bem, Hilton. Não precisa se preocupar. Tchau.
– Você tropeçou hoje de manhã, na praia. Parecia
desorientada. Seu nariz começou a sangrar.
– Foi uma pequena hemorragia nasal.
– Queremos que você faça outro check-up...
– Ótimo.
– Você acessou a matrix hoje, Angie. Sua presença foi
registrada no setor industrial do BAMA.
– Ah, era isso, então?
– Quer falar a respeito?
– Não tenho nada a dizer. Estava apenas me divertindo.
Mas, se você quer saber, eu estava empacotando uma
tralha que o Bobby deixou aqui. Você teria aprovado,
Hilton! Encontrei um console que ele deixou eexperimentei. Apertei uma tecla, fiquei sentada lá
olhando em volta, depois me despluguei.
– Sinto muito, Angie.
– Por quê?
– Por te incomodar. Estou indo.
– Hilton, você sabe onde o Bobby está?
– Não.
– Você está me dizendo que a segurança da Net não o
tem monitorado?
– Estou dizendo que não sei, Angie. Esta é a verdade.
– Você poderia descobrir, se quisesse?
Outra pausa. – Não sei. Mesmo que pudesse, não estou
certo de que faria isso.
– Obrigada. Tchau, Hilton.
– Tchau, Angie.
***
Sentou-se no terraço aquela noite,
observando os insetos na areia iluminada.
no
escuro,
Pensando em Brigitte e em seu aviso, na droga na
jaqueta e no carregador de dermas em seu armário de
medicamentos. Pensando no ciberespaço e no triste
confinamento que havia sentido com o Ono-Sendai, tão
longe da liberdade dos loa.Pensando nos sonhos de outros, corredores retorcidos
sobre si mesmos, matizes desbotados de
tapetes antigos... Um velho, uma cabeça feita de joias,
um rosto pálido e tenso com olhos que eram espelhos... E
uma praia, no vento e na escuridão.
Não esta praia, não Malibu.
***
E, em algum lugar, numa madrugada escura da
Califórnia, poucas horas antes do amanhecer, entre os
corredores, as galerias, os rostos de sonho, fragmentos
de uma conversa de que mal se lembrava, acordando em
meio à neblina pálida das janelas do quarto principal, ela
fez com que algo se soltasse e o arrastou de volta
através do muro do sono.
Rolando da cama, tateando dentro de uma gaveta no
criado-mudo, encontrou uma caneta
Porsche, presente de um assistente; inscreveu seu
tesouro na contracapa brilhante de uma revista italiana
de moda:
T-A
– Ligue para a Continuidade – ordenou para a casa, após
sua terceira xícara de café.
– Olá, Angie – disse a Continuidade.
– Aquela sequência orbital que fizemos há dois anos. O
iate do belga... – Ela bebeu o café queesfriava. – Qual era o nome daquele lugar para onde ele
queria me levar? Aquele que o Robin decidiu que era
muito decadente.
– Freeside – disse o sistema especialista.
– Quem gravou lá antes?
– Tally Isham gravou nove sequências em Freeside.
– Não era decadente demais para ela?
– Isso foi há quinze anos. Estava na moda.
– Me envie aquelas sequências.
– Feito.
– Tchau.
– Tchau, Angie.
Continuidade estava escrevendo um livro. Robin Lanier
tinha lhe contado. Ela havia perguntado
sobre o que era. Não funcionava assim, ele respondeu.
Ela se fechava sobre si mesma e mudava
constantemente – A Continuidade estava sempre
escrevendo. Ela perguntou o porquê. Mas Robin já tinha
mudado de assunto, porque a Continuidade era uma IA e
aquele era o tipo de coisa que inteligências artificiais
faziam.
Sua ligação para a Continuidade lhe custou outra ligação
de Swift.
– Angie, sobre aquele check-up...– Você ainda não marcou? Quero voltar a trabalhar. Liguei
para a Continuidade esta manhã.
Estou pensando sobre uma sequência orbital. Estou
dando uma olhada em algumas coisas que Tally
fez, talvez eu tenha algumas ideias.
Houve um silêncio. Ela queria rir. Era difícil deixar Swift
sem saber o que dizer. – Tem certeza, Angie? É
maravilhoso, mas você está realmente disposta?
– Estou bem melhor, Hilton. Estou bem. Quero trabalhar.
As férias acabaram. Chame Porphyre
aqui para arrumar meu cabelo, antes que eu encontre
alguém.
– Você sabe, Angie – disse –, ficamos muito felizes com
isso.
– Chame Porphyre. Marque o check-up. – Coup-poudre.
Quem, Hilton? Talvez você?
Ele tinha os meios, pensou, meia hora mais tarde,
enquanto andava de um lado para o outro, no
deck enevoado. Seu vício não havia ameaçado a Net,
nem tinha afetado sua produção. Não houve efeitos
colaterais físicos. Se houvesse, Sense/Net jamais a teria
deixado começar. O designer da droga, pensou. O
designer saberia. E nunca lhe diria, mesmo se pudesse
chegar até ele, e duvidava que pudesse. Suponha,
pensou, suas mãos na ferrugem do corrimão, que não
tinha sido o designer?Que a molécula houvesse sido projetada por outra
pessoa, para fins próprios?
– Seu cabeleireiro – disse a casa.
Ela entrou.
Porphyre a esperava, envolto num jérsei opaco, alguma
coisa da temporada parisiense. Seu rosto, tão suave
quanto ébano polido, abriu-se num sorriso afetado
quando a viu. – Querida – ele a repreendeu –, você está
parecendo lixo artesanal.
Ela riu. Porphyre soltou gritinhos e exclamações, e se
aproximou para passar seus longos dedos
nas franjas de Angie, com uma repugnância fingida. –
Você se comportou mal, mocinha. Porphyre disse que
aquelas drogas faziam mal!
Ela o olhou. Era muito alto e, sabia, muito forte. Como
um galgo cheio de esteroides, alguém
disse uma vez. Sua cabeça depilada revelava uma
simetria inconcebível na natureza.
– Você está bem? – perguntou ele, com a outra voz,
aquele entusiasmo maníaco desaparecendo
como se tivessem apertado um botão.
– Estou bem.
– Doeu?
– Sim. Doeu.– Você sabe – disse, tocando o queixo dela suavemente
com a ponta do dedo –, ninguém entendia
o que você queria com aquela merda. Você não parecia
ficar numa boa...
– Não era para isso. Era como estar aqui, estar lá, só que
não era preciso...
– Sentir tanto as coisas?
– Sim.
Ele concordou com a cabeça, lentamente. – Então era um
troço realmente forte.
– Que se dane – disse ela. – Estou de volta.
O sorriso dele voltou. – Vamos lavar seu cabelo.
– Já lavei ontem!
– No quê? Não. Fala sério! – Ele a conduziu para as
escadarias.
No banheiro branco, massageou algo em seu couro
cabeludo.
– Tem visto Robin?
Despejou água fria sobre o cabelo. – Esse senhor Lanier
está em Londres, querida. Esse senhor
Lanier e eu não estamos nos falando no momento.
Agora, sente-se. – Ergueu as costas da cadeira e
enrolou uma toalha no pescoço dela.– Por que não? – Sentiu voltar sua curiosidade sobre as
fofocas da Net, uma das outras especialidades de
Porphyre.
– Porque – disse o cabeleireiro, seu tom cuidadosamente
neutro, enquanto penteava os cabelos –
ele andou dizendo coisas bem ruins sobre Angela Mitchell
enquanto ela estava na Jamaica, colocando sua
cabecinha no lugar.
Não era o que ela esperava. – Ele disse?
– E como, querida. – Começou a cortar o cabelo usando
tesouras, o que era uma de suas marcas
registradas; recusava-se a usar o pincel a laser e dizia
que nunca tinha encostado em um.
– Você está brincando, Porphyre?
– Não. Claro, ele não diria essas coisas para mim, mas
Porphyre ouve, Porphyre sempre ouve.
Partiu para Londres no dia seguinte à sua chegada.
– E o que ele teria dito?
– Que você está louca. Com ou sem as drogas. Que ouve
vozes. Que os psicólogos da Net sabem.
Vozes ... – Quem lhe contou isso? – Tentou virar a cadeira.
– Não mexa a sua cabeça. Assim. – Voltou ao seu
trabalho. – Não posso dizer. Confie em mim.
***Houve várias ligações depois que Porphyre foi embora.
Sua equipe de produção, louca para dizer oi. – Sem mais
ligações hoje à tarde – disse para a casa. – Eu vou assistir
às sequências de Tally lá em cima.
Ela encontrou uma garrafa de Corona no fundo da
geladeira e levou-a para o quarto. A unidade
stim na cômoda de teca estava equipada com trodos de
qualidade de estúdio que não tinham estado lá quando
ela havia ido para a Jamaica. Técnicos da Net faziam a
atualização periódica dos equipamentos da casa. Ela
tomou um gole de cerveja, colocou a garrafa na mesinha
de cabeceira e
deitou com os trodos sobre a testa. – Certo – disse ela –,
pode soltar.
Dentro da carne de Tally, da respiração de Tally.
Como fui capaz de substituir você? , ela se perguntou,
dominada pelo ser físico da ex-estrela.
Dou às pessoas este mesmo prazer?
Tally-Angie observando um precipício recoberto por
vinhedos, que também era um bulevar, olhando para o
horizonte invertido, retângulos distantes de quadras de
tênis, o “sol” do Freeside, um filamento axial brilhando
sobre sua cabeça...
– Passe adiante – ordenou à casa.
Entrou em um músculo se movendo com suavidade e um
borrão de concreto, Tally guiando sua
bicicleta num velódromo de baixa gravidade...– Passe adiante.
Uma cena de jantar, a tensão das tiras de veludo sobre
seus ombros, o rapaz no outro lado da
mesa se debruçando para servir mais vinho...
Lençóis de linho, uma mão entre suas pernas, luz
púrpura através de vidro laminado, som de água
correndo...
– Volte. O restaurante.
O vinho tinto borbulhando em seu copo...
– Um pouco mais. Pausa. Isso.
Os olhos de Tally tinham se focado no pulso bronzeado
do rapaz, não na garrafa.
– Eu quero uma cópia dessa imagem – disse, tirando os
trodos. Sentou-se e tomou um gole de
cerveja, que se misturou estranhamente com o sabor
fantasma do vinho gravado por Tally.
A impressora, no andar de baixo, fez um barulho suave
enquanto completava a tarefa. Ela se forçou para descer
as escadas lentamente, mas, quando chegou à
impressora, na cozinha, a imagem a desapontou.
– Não dá para limpar isso? – perguntou à casa. – Quero
ler o rótulo da garrafa.
– Centralizando a imagem – disse a casa – e girando o
objeto-alvo oito graus.A impressora murmurou suavemente enquanto a nova
imagem era gerada. Angie encontrou seu
tesouro antes que a máquina pudesse terminar, seu
sinete onírico em tinta marrom: T-A.
Eles possuíram vinhedos próprios, pensou.
Tessier-Ashpool S.A., em tipologia comprida e fina.
– Te peguei – murmurou.

RÁDIO TEXAS
Mona podia ver o sol através de alguns rasgos no
plástico negro que mantinha preso sobre a janela. Odiava
demasiado aquele lugar, o squat, para ficar lá quando
estava acordada ou sóbria, e agora ela estava nestes
dois estados.
Ela saiu silenciosamente da cama, fazendo uma careta
quando seus pés nus encostaram no chão
e tateou, procurando suas sandálias de plástico. O lugar
estava sujo; provavelmente dava para pegar tétano só
de se encostar na parede. Sua pele ficou arrepiada ao
pensar nisso. Essas coisas pareciam não incomodar
Eddy; ele estava absorto demais em seus esquemas para
perceber o que o rodeava. E
sempre dava um jeito de se manter limpo, como um
gato. Era limpo como um gato, nunca havia um
grama de poeira debaixo de suas unhas bem cuidadas.
Ela pensava que Eddy gastava a maior parte do dinheiroque ela ganhava com as roupas dele, embora nunca lhe
tenha ocorrido questionar o fato.
Mona tinha 16 anos e não tinha um SIN, e um cliente
mais velho tinha dito que aquilo era uma canção,
“Sixteen and SINless”. Isso significava que não havia sido
inscrita com um SIN – Single Identification Number, um
número único de identificação –, quando nasceu, então
ela cresceu fora da maior parte
dos sistemas oficiais. Sabia que era possível conseguir
um SIN, se você não tivesse um, mas isso significava ter
de ir a um prédio em algum lugar, falar com um figurão,
e isso estava longe de ser a ideia que Mona tinha de
curtir a vida, ou mesmo ter um comportamento normal.
Ela tinha uma rotina para vestir-se naquele lugar e era
capaz de fazer tudo no escuro. Colocava
os chinelos, depois de bater um contra o outro e sacudir
para desalojar possíveis insetos, e depois caminhava
para onde sabia que estava um rolo de fax antigo, numa
caixa de isopor ao lado da janela.
Pegava cerca de um metro de fax, talvez um dia e meio
do jornal Asahi Shimbun que era dobrado e alisado,
então colocado no chão. Aí era possível ficar em pé em
cima dele, pegar a sacola de plástico ao lado da caixa,
desfazer o nó do arame que a mantinha fechada e pegar
as roupas que quisesse.
Quando tirasse as sandálias para colocar as calças, tinha
certeza de que estaria pisando em fax fresco.
Era uma questão de fé para Mona acreditar que nada
estaria vagando pelo fax na hora em que ela colocasse ojeans e, depois, se calçasse de novo.
Dava para colocar uma camisa ou algo do tipo, lacrar de
novo a sacola cuidadosamente e sair
de lá. Maquiagem, quando necessária, era feita no
corredor do lado de fora; ainda havia um pedaço de
espelho ao lado do elevador abandonado, com uma tira
biofluorescente da Fuji colada acima dele.
Havia um cheiro forte de urina ao lado do elevador
naquela manhã, então decidiu não se maquiar.
Nunca se via ninguém no prédio, mas algumas vezes era
possível ouvi-los; música através de uma porta fechada
ou passos logo após a dobra no final de um corredor.
Bem, fazia sentido; Mona
também não desejava encontrar seus vizinhos.
Ela desceu três lances de escada em direção à escuridão
da garagem no subsolo. Tinha sua lanterna na mão,
encontrou seu caminho com seis rápidas piscadas que a
guiaram ao redor de poças
de água estagnada e emaranhados de cabos de fibra
óptica suspensos, para cima nos degraus de concreto
que davam no beco. Podia sentir o cheiro da praia, às
vezes, ali no beco, se o vento estivesse na direção certa,
mas naquele dia só dava para sentir o cheiro do lixo. A
lateral do prédio se erguia acima dela, então se moveu
rápido, antes que algum babaca resolvesse jogar uma
garrafa ou coisa pior. Chegando à avenida, diminuiu o
passo, mas não muito; estava ciente do dinheiro em seu
bolso e cheia de planos sobre como gastá-lo. Não
adiantaria fugir, não agora quando parecia que Eddy
havia conseguido uma passagem para sair daquele lugar.Ficava alternando entre se dizer que isso era uma coisa
certa, que estavam praticamente de partida, e alertar-se
que era melhor não se iludir. Conhecia muito bem os
negócios ‘certos’ de Eddy: a Flórida não tinha sido um
deles? Como era agradável na
Flórida e como as praias eram lindas, cheias de caras
bonitões com dinheiro, o lugar certo para umas férias
remuneradas que tinham se tornado o mês mais longo
de que Mona podia se lembrar. Na prática, fazia um calor
cão na Flórida, como uma sauna. As únicas praias que
não eram privativas estavam poluídas, peixes mortos
rolando de barriga para cima na água rasa. Talvez as
praias privativas fossem iguais, mas não era possível vê-
las, somente os cordões de isolamento e os guardas de
bermuda circulando. Eddy ficava entusiasmado com as
armas que os guardas portavam e
descrevia cada uma delas nos mínimos detalhes. Ele não
tinha uma arma, contudo, não que ela soubesse, e Mona
achava que isso era bom. Às vezes não se sentia o cheiro
dos peixes mortos, porque havia outro cheiro, um cheiro
de cloro que queimava o céu da boca, alguma coisa que
vinha
das fábricas ao longo da costa. Se havia caras bonitões,
ainda assim eram clientes e não estavam exatamente a
fim de pagar o dobro.
A única coisa bacana na Flórida eram as drogas, fáceis
de comprar, baratas e extremamente fortes. Às vezes,
imaginava que o cheiro de água sanitária era o cheiro de
milhares de laboratórios de drogas preparando algum
tipo de coquetel impensável, moléculas estranhas
agitando seus rabos excêntricos, prontas para seu
destino e para as ruas.Saiu da Avenida e caminhou por uma fileira de
barraquinhas de comida sem licença. Seu estômago
começou a roncar com o aroma, mas ela não confiava
em comida de rua, não se pudesse
evitar, e havia alguns lugares licenciados no shopping
que ainda aceitariam dinheiro vivo. Alguém tocava um
trompete no quadrado de concreto que havia sido um
estacionamento, um solo cubano estridente que
ricocheteava e se distorcia entre os muros de concreto,
notas se esvaindo no tumulto matinal do mercado. Um
evangelista pregava, seus braços abertos no alto, em
formato de cruz, enquanto um Jesus desbotado e pálido
copiava o gesto no ar acima dele. O dispositivo de
projeção
estava na caixa em que ele estava de pé, mas usava
uma mochila de nylon bastante desgastada, com
dois alto-falantes despontando sobre cada ombro, como
cabeças cromadas sem face. O evangelista olhou para
Jesus, fez uma careta e ajustou alguma coisa em seu
cin
