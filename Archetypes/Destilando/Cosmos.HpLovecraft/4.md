greater altitude. And
so the prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little
ceremony as his miniature Tower of Babel rose course by course. Several of the coffins
began to split under the stress of handling, and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of
little Matthew Fenner for the top, in order that his feet might have as certain a surface as
possible. In the semi-gloom he trusted mostly to touch to select the right one, and indeed
came upon it almost by accident, since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd
volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layer.
The tower at length finished, and his aching arms rested by a pause during which he sat on
the bottom step of his grim device, Birch cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast
of the narrow transom. The borders of the space were entirely of brick, and there seemed little
doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to allow his body to pass. As his hammer
blows began to fall, the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging
and may have been mocking. In either case it would have been appropriate; for the
unexpected tenacity of the easy-looking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the
vanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible
stimulus.
Dusk fell and found Birch still toiling. He worked largely by feeling now, since newly gathered
clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his
encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture. He could, he was sure, get out by
midnight—though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie
implications. Undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and the company
beneath his feet, he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a
fragment hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that
pawed near the cypress tree. In time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in
it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked. He would
not, he found, have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height; for the hole was
on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit.
It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get through the transom.
Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and sat a while on the
bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside. The hungry
horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily, and he vaguely wished it would stop.
He was curiously unelated over his impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for
his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age. As he remounted the splitting coffins
he felt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon reaching the topmost one, he heard
that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood. He had, it seems,
planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform; for no sooner was his full
bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way, jouncing him two feet down on a surface
which even he did not care to imagine. Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which
billowed forth even to the open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a
neigh, and plunged madly off through the night, the wagon rattling crazily behind it.
Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged
transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try. Clutching the edges of the aperture,
he sought to pull himself up, when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent
drag on both his ankles. In another moment he knew fear for the first time that night; for
struggle as he would, he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in
relentless captivity. Horrible pains, as of savage wounds, shot through his calves; and in his
mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters,
loose nails, or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box. Perhaps he screamed. At any
rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was
almost eclipsed in a half-swoon.
Instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom, and in the crawl which followed his
jarring thud on the damp ground. He could not walk, it appeared, and the emerging moon
must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery
lodge; his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste, and his body responding with
that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of
nightmare. There was evidently, however, no pursuer; for he was alone and alive when
Armington, the lodge-keeper, answered his feeble clawing at the door.
Armington helped Birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son Edwin for Dr.
Davis. The afflicted man was fully conscious, but would say nothing of any consequence;
merely muttering such things as ―oh, my ankles!‖, ―let go!‖, or ―shut in the tomb‖. Then the
doctor came with his medicine-case and asked crisp questions, and removed the patient‘s
outer clothing, shoes, and socks. The wounds—for both ankles were frightfully lacerated
about the Achilles‘ tendons—seemed to puzzle the old physician greatly, and finally almost to
frighten him. His questioning grew more than medically tense, and his hands shook as he
dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight
as quickly as possible.
For an impersonal doctor, Davis‘ ominous and awestruck cross-examination became very
strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detail of his
horrible experience. He was oddly anxious to know if Birch were sure—absolutely sure—of
the identity of that top coffin of the pile; how he had chosen it, how he had been certain of it
as the Fenner coffin in the dusk, and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate
coffin of vicious Asaph Sawyer. Would the firm Fenner casket have caved in so readily?
Davis, an old-time village practitioner, had of course seen both at the respective funerals, as
indeed he had attended both Fenner and Sawyer in their last illnesses. He had even
wondered, at Sawyer‘s funeral, how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box
so closely akin to that of the diminutive Fenner.
After a full two hours Dr. Davis left, urging Birch to insist at all times that his wounds were
caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood. What else, he added, could ever in any
case be proved or believed? But it would be well to say as little as could be said, and to let no
other doctor treat the wounds. Birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his
story; and when I saw the scars—ancient and whitened as they then were—I agreed that he
was wise in so doing. He always remained lame, for the great tendons had been severed; but
I think the greatest lameness was in his soul. His thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and
logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain
chance allusions such as ―Friday‖, ―tomb‖, ―coffin‖, and words of less obvious concatenation.
His frightened horse had gone home, but his frightened wits never quite did that. He changed
his business, but something always preyed upon him. It may have been just fear, and it may
have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities. His drinking,
of course, only aggravated what it was meant to alleviate.
When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving
tomb. The moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade, and the
latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside. Steeled by old ordeals in
dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the nausea of mind and body
that everything in sight and smell induced. He cried aloud once, and a little later gave a gasp
that was more terrible than a cry. Then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his
calling by rousing and shaking his patient, and hurling at him a succession of shuddering
whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriol.
―It was Asaph‘s coffin, Birch, just as I thought! I knew his teeth, with the front ones missing on
the upper jaw—never, for God‘s sake, shew those wounds! The body was pretty badly gone,
but if ever I saw vindictiveness on any face—or former face. . . . You know what a fiend he
was for revenge—how he ruined old Raymond thirty years after their boundary suit, and how
he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last August. . . . He was the devil
incarnate, Birch, and I believe his eye-for-an-eye fury could beat old Father Death himself.
God, what a rage! I‘d hate to have it aimed at me!
―Why did you do it, Birch? He was a scoundrel, and I don‘t blame you for giving him a cast-
aside coffin, but you always did go too damned far! Well enough to skimp on the thing some
way, but you knew what a little man old Fenner was.
―I‘ll never get the picture out of my head as long as I live. You kicked hard, for Asaph‘s coffin
was on the floor. His head was broken in, and everything was tumbled about. I‘ve seen sights
before, but there was one thing too much here. An eye for an eye! Great heavens, Birch, but
you got what you deserved. The skull turned my stomach, but the other was worse—those
ankles cut neatly off to fit Matt Fenner’s cast-aside coffin!”

The Descendant
(1926)
In London there is a man who screams when the church bells ring. He lives all alone with his
streaked cat in Gray‘s Inn, and people call him harmlessly mad. His room is filled with books
of the tamest and most puerile kind, and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in their feeble
pages. All he seeks from life is not to think. For some reason thought is very horrible to him,
and anything which stirs the imagination he flees as a plague. He is very thin and grey and
wrinkled, but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he looks. Fear has its
grisly claws upon him, and a sound will make him start with staring eyes and sweat-beaded
forehead. Friends and companions he shuns, for he wishes to answer no questions. Those
who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him now. He dropped
them all years ago, and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from
sight in some hidden byway. It is a decade now since he moved into Gray‘s Inn, and of where
he had been he would say nothing till the night young Williams bought the Necronomicon.
Williams was a dreamer, and only twenty-three, and when he moved into the ancient house
he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next
room. He forced his friendship where old friends dared not force theirs, and marvelled at the
fright that sat upon this gaunt, haggard watcher and listener. For that the man always watched
and listened no one could doubt. He watched and listened with his mind more than with his
eyes and ears, and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over
gay, insipid novels. And when the church bells rang he would stop his ears and scream, and
the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison till the last peal died reverberantly away.
But try as Williams would, he could not make his neighbour speak of anything profound or
hidden. The old man would not live up to his aspect and manner, but would feign a smile and
a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles; his voice every moment
rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto. That his
learning was deep and thorough, his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear; and
Williams was not surprised to hear that he had been to Harrow and Oxford. Later it developed
that he was none other than Lord Northam, of whose ancient hereditary castle on the
Yorkshire coast so many odd things were told; but when Williams tried to talk of the castle,
and of its reputed Roman origin, he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it.
He even tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed under crypts, hewn out of the solid
crag that frowns on the North Sea, was brought up.
So matters went till that night when Williams brought home the infamous Necronomicon of the
mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. He had known of the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year,
when his dawning love of the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old
bookseller in Chandos Street; and he had always wondered why men paled when they spoke
of it. The old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the
shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with
frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful black-letter.
But now, at last, he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a
ludicrously low figure. It was at a Jew‘s shop in the squalid precincts of Clare Market, where
he had often bought strange things before, and he almost fancied the gnarled old Levite
smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made. The bulky leather cover with
the brass clasp had been so prominently visible, and the price was so absurdly slight.
The one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports, and some of
the diagrams set in the vague Latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections
in his brain. He felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin
deciphering it, and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old Jew
chuckled disturbingly behind him. But when at last it was safe in his room he found the
combination of black-letter and debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist, and
reluctantly called on his strange, frightened friend for help with the twisted, mediaeval Latin.
Lord Northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat, and started violently when the
young man entered. Then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly, and fainted altogether
when Williams uttered the title. It was when he regained his senses that he told his story; told
his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers, lest his friend be not quick to burn the
accursed book and give wide scattering to its ashes.
* * *
There must, Lord Northam whispered, have been something wrong at the start; but it would
never have come to a head if he had not explored too far. He was the nineteenth Baron of a
line whose beginnings went uncomfortably far back into the past—unbelievably far, if vague
tradition could be heeded, for there were family tales of a descent from pre-Saxon times,
when a certain Cnaeus Gabinius Capito, military tribune in the Third Augustan Legion then
stationed at Lindum in Roman Britain, had been summarily expelled from his command for
participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion. Gabinius had, the rumour
ran, come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met together and made the Elder Sign in
the dark; strange folk whom the Britons knew not save in fear, and who were the last to
survive from a great land in the west that had sunk, leaving only the islands with the raths and
circles and shrines of which Stonehenge was the greatest. There was no certainty, of course,
in the legend that Gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and
founded a line which Pict and Saxon, Dane and Norman were powerless to obliterate; or in
the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the bold companion and lieutenant of the Black
Prince whom Edward Third created Baron of Northam. These things were not certain, yet they
were often told; and in truth the stonework of Northam Keep did look alarmingly like the
masonry of Hadrian‘s Wall. As a child Lord Northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping
in the older parts of the castle, and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his
memory for half-amorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his
waking experience. He became a dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying; a searcher
for strange realms and relationships once familiar, yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of
earth.
Filled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in a fabric vast and ominous, and
that unknown demesnes press on and permeate the sphere of the known at every point,
Northam in youth and young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult
mystery. Nowhere, however, could he find ease and content; and as he grew older the
staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him. During the
‘nineties he dabbled in Satanism, and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory
which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying
laws of Nature. Books like Ignatius Donnelly‘s chimerical account of Atlantis he absorbed with
zest, and a dozen obscure precursors of Charles Fort enthralled him with their vagaries. He
would travel leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder, and once went into
the desert of Araby to seek a Nameless City of faint report, which no man has ever beheld.
There rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed, which if one
found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled so dimly at the back
of his memory. It might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul.
Perhaps he held within his own half-explored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him
to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions; which would bind him to the stars, and to the
infinities and eternities beyond them.

Cool Air
(1926)
You ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draught of cool air; why I shiver more than others
upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening
creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day. There are those who say I respond to cold as
others do to a bad odour, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will do is to relate
the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered, and leave it to you to judge whether or not
this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarity.
It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness, silence, and
solitude. I found it in the glare of mid-afternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the
teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady and two
stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured some dreary and unprofitable
magazine work in the city of New York; and being unable to pay any substantial rent, began
drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might
combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and very reasonable price.
It soon developed that I had only a choice between different evils, but after a time I came
upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had
sampled.
The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently from the late forties,
and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent
from high levels of tasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with
impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing
mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular,
and the hot water not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a
bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again. The landlady, a slatternly, almost
bearded Spanish woman named Herrero, did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of
the late-burning electric light in my third-floor front hall room; and my fellow-lodgers were as
quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire, being mostly Spaniards a little above the
coarsest and crudest grade. Only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a
serious annoyance.
I had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred. One evening at
about eight I heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that I had been
smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time. Looking about, I saw that the ceiling
was wet and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward
the street. Anxious to stop the matter at its source, I hastened to the basement to tell the
landlady; and was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set right.
―Doctair Muñoz,‖ she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, ―he have speel hees
chemicals. He ees too seeck for doctair heemself—seecker and seecker all the time—but he
weel not have no othair for help. He ees vairy queer in hees seeckness—all day he take
funnee-smelling baths, and he cannot get excite or warm. All hees own housework he do—
hees leetle room are full of bottles and machines, and he do not work as doctair. But he was
great once—my fathair in Barcelona have hear of heem—and only joost now he feex a arm of
the plumber that get hurt of sudden. He nevair go out, only on roof, and my boy Esteban he
breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals. My Gawd, the sal-
ammoniac that man use for keep heem cool!‖
Mrs. Herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor, and I returned to my room. The
ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air,
I heard the landlady‘s heavy footsteps above me. Dr. Muñoz I had never heard, save for
certain sounds as of some gasoline-driven mechanism; since his step was soft and gentle. I
wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his
obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity. There is, I
reflected tritely, an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who has come
down in the world.
I might never have known Dr. Muñoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized
me one forenoon as I sat writing in my room. Physicians had told me of the danger of those
spells, and I knew there was no time to be lost; so remembering what the landlady had said
about the invalid‘s help of the injured workman, I dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly
at the door above mine. My knock was answered in good English by a curious voice some
distance to the right, asking my name and business; and these things being stated, there
came an opening of the door next to the one I had sought.
A rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the hottest of late June, I
shivered as I crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration
surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness. A folding couch now filled its diurnal role
of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous hangings, old paintings, and mellow
bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman‘s study rather than a boarding-house bedroom. I now
saw that the hall room above mine—the ―leetle room‖ of bottles and machines which Mrs.
Herrero had mentioned—was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living
quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous
bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices. Dr. Muñoz, most
certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination.
The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad in somewhat formal
dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was
adorned by a short iron-grey full beard, and an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark
eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy
otherwise dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a
barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking
intelligence and superior blood and breeding.
Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Muñoz in that blast of cool air, I felt a repugnance which nothing in
his aspect could justify. Only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have
afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable
considering the man‘s known invalidism. It might, too, have been the singular cold that
alienated me; for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always
excites aversion, distrust, and fear.
But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician‘s extreme skill at
once became manifest despite the ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking
hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master‘s
deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless
voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost
all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation.
Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him, and he rambled on almost
garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the
smaller laboratory room. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty in
this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days
surged over him.
His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even perceive that he breathed as
the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out. He sought to distract my mind from my own seizure
by speaking of his theories and experiments; and I remember his tactfully consoling me about
my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are stronger than organic life itself, so
that if a bodily frame be but originally healthy and carefully preserved, it may through a
scientific enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation despite the most
serious impairments, defects, or even absences in the battery of specific organs. He might, he
half jestingly said, some day teach me to live—or at least to possess some kind of conscious
existence—without any heart at all! For his part, he was afflicted with a complication of
maladies requiring a very exact regimen which included constant cold. Any marked rise in
temperature might, if prolonged, affect him fatally; and the frigidity of his habitation—some 55
or 56 degrees Fahrenheit—was maintained by an absorption system of ammonia cooling, the
gasoline engine of whose pumps I had often heard in my own room below.
Relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, I left the shivery place a disciple and
devotee of the gifted recluse. After that I paid him frequent overcoated calls; listening while he
told of secret researches and almost ghastly results, and trembling a bit when I examined the
unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves. I was eventually, I may
add, almost cured of my disease for all time by his skilful ministrations. It seems that he did
not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists, since he believed these cryptic formulae to
contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably have singular effects on the
substance of a nervous system from which organic pulsations had fled. I was touched by his
account of the aged Dr. Torres of Valencia, who had shared his earlier experiments with him
through the great illness of eighteen years before, whence his present disorders proceeded.
No sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to
the grim enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too great; for Dr. Muñoz made it
whisperingly clear—though not in detail—that the methods of healing had been most
extraordinary, involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative
Galens.
As the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but
unmistakably losing ground physically, as Mrs. Herrero had suggested. The livid aspect of his
countenance was intensified, his voice became more hollow and indistinct, his muscular
motions were less perfectly coördinated, and his mind and will displayed less resilience and
initiative. Of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware, and little by little his
expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something
of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt.
He developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and Egyptian incense
till his room smelled like the vault of a sepulchred Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings. At the same
time his demands for cold air increased, and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of
his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the
temperature as low as 34° or 40° and finally even 28°; the bathroom and laboratory, of
course, being less chilled, in order that water might not freeze, and that chemical processes
might not be impeded. The tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from around the
connecting door, so I helped him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty. A kind of growing
horror, of outré and morbid cast, seemed to possess him. He talked of death incessantly, but
laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested.
All in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for
his healing I could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust
his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which I bought especially
for the purpose. I likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the
chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses.
An increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment.
The whole house, as I have said, had a musty odour; but the smell in his room was worse—
and in spite of all the spices and incense, and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant
baths which he insisted on taking unaided. I perceived that it must be connected with his
ailment, and shuddered when I reflected on what that ailment might be. Mrs. Herrero crossed
herself when she looked at him, and gave him up unreservedly to me; not even letting her son
Esteban continue to run errands for him. When I suggested other physicians, the sufferer
would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain. He evidently feared the
physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned, and
he refused to be confined to his bed. The lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return
of his fiery purpose, so that he seemed about to hurl defiance at the death-daemon even as
that ancient enemy seized him. The pretence of eating, always curiously like a formality with
him, he virtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from total
collapse.
He acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he carefully sealed and
filled with injunctions that I transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he named—
for the most part lettered East Indians, but including a once celebrated French physician now
generally thought dead, and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered.
As it happened, I burned all these papers undelivered and unopened. His aspect and voice
became utterly frightful, and his presence almost unbearable. One September day an
unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his
electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of
sight. That man, oddly enough, had been through the terrors of the Great War without having
incurred any fright so thorough.
Then, in the middle of October, the horror of horrors came with stupefying suddenness. One
night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down, so that within three
hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible. Dr. Muñoz summoned me by
thumping on the floor, and I worked desperately to repair the injury while my host cursed in a
tone whose lifeless, rattling hollowness surpassed description. My amateur efforts, however,
proved of no use; and when I had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring all-night garage
we learned that nothing could be done till morning, when a new piston would have to be
obtained. The moribund hermit‘s rage and fear, swelling to grotesque proportions, seemed
likely to shatter what remained of his failing physique; and once a spasm caused him to clap
his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom. He groped his way out with face tightly
bandaged, and I never saw his eyes again.
The frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing, and at about 5 a.m. the doctor
retired to the bathroom, commanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice I could obtain at
all-night drug stores and cafeterias. As I would return from my sometimes discouraging trips
and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door, I could hear a restless splashing within,
and a thick voice croaking out the order for ―More—more!‖ At length a warm day broke, and
the shops opened one by one. I asked Esteban either to help with the ice-fetching whilst I
obtained the pump piston, or to order the piston while I continued with the ice; but instructed
by his mother, he absolutely refused.
Finally I hired a seedy-looking loafer whom I encountered on the corner of Eighth Avenue to
keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where I introduced him, and applied
myself diligently to the task of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to
install it. The task seemed interminable, and I raged almost as violently as the hermit when I
saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic
quest from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car. About noon I
encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at approximately 1:30 p.m. arrived at
my boarding-place with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent
mechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time.
Black terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil, and above the
chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep basso. Fiendish things were in the air,
and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the
doctor‘s closed door. The lounger I had hired, it seems, had fled screaming and mad-eyed not
long after his second delivery of ice; perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity. He could not,
of course, have locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the
inside. There was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow, thick dripping.
Briefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost
soul, I advised the breaking down of the door; but the landlady found a way to turn the key
from the outside with some wire device. We had previously opened the doors of all the other
rooms on that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses protected by
handkerchiefs, we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm
sun of early afternoon.
A kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door, and thence to the
desk, where a terrible little pool had accumulated. Something was scrawled there in pencil in
an awful, blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that
traced the hurried last words. Then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterably.
What was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But this is what I
shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before I drew a match and burned it to a
crisp; what I puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from
that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station. The
nauseous words seemed well-nigh incredible in that yellow sunlight, with the clatter of cars
and motor trucks ascending clamorously from crowded Fourteenth Street, yet I confess that I
believed them then. Whether I believe them now I honestly do not know. There are things
about which it is better not to speculate, and all that I can say is that I hate the smell of
ammonia, and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool air.
―The end,‖ ran that noisome scrawl, ―is here. No more ice—the man looked and ran away.
Warmer every minute, and the tissues can‘t last. I fancy you know—what I said about the will
and the nerves and the preserved body after the organs ceased to work. It was good theory,
but couldn‘t keep up indefinitely. There was a gradual deterioration I had not foreseen. Dr.
Torres knew, but the shock killed him. He couldn‘t stand what he had to do—he had to get me
in a strange, dark place when he minded my letter and nursed me back. And the organs never
would work again. It had to be done my way—artificial preservation—for you see I died that
time eighteen years ago.”

I. The Horror in Clay.
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all
its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it
was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction,
have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge
will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a
new dark age.
Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world
and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms
which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that
there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when I think of it and
maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out
from an accidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaper item
and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out;
certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that the
professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have
destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.
My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926–27 with the death of my grand-uncle
George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University,
Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient
inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that
his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified
by the obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from
the Newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-
looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside
which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased‘s home in Williams Street.
Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that
some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a
man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but
latterly I am inclined to wonder—and more than wonder.
As my grand-uncle‘s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected to go
over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files
and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later
published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found
exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had been
locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the
professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but when I did
so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For what could
be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings
which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most superficial
impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent
disturbance of an old man‘s peace of mind.
The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in
area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern in atmosphere
and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do
not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of
some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite
much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this
particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations.
Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent, though its
impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of
monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could
conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of
an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the
thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary
wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.
Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background.
The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings, in Professor
Angell‘s most recent hand; and made no pretence to literary style. What seemed to be the
main document was headed ―CTHULHU CULT‖ in characters painstakingly printed to avoid
the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. The manuscript was divided into two sections,
the first of which was headed ―1925—Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St.,
Providence, R.I.‖, and the second, ―Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville St.,
New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, & Prof. Webb‘s Acct.‖ The other
manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them accounts of the queer dreams of
different persons, some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W.
Scott-Elliot‘s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret
societies and hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and
anthropological source-books as Frazer‘s Golden Bough and Miss Murray‘s Witch-Cult in
Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group
folly or mania in the spring of 1925.
The first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears that on March 1st,
1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell
bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card
bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest
son of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at
the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that
institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had
from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the
habit of relating. He called himself ―psychically hypersensitive‖, but the staid folk of the ancient
commercial city dismissed him as merely ―queer‖. Never mingling much with his kind, he had
dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of
aesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its
conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.
On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor‘s manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for
the benefit of his host‘s archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-
relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy;
and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet
implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcox‘s rejoinder, which impressed my
uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast
which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly
characteristic of him. He said, ―It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange
cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-
girdled Babylon.‖
It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory
and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the
night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox‘s
imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of
great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze
and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some
undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which
only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost
unpronounceable jumble of letters, ―Cthulhu fhtagn‖.
This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor
Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost frantic
intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in
his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old
age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial
design. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which
tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the
repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of
membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell
became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore,
he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for
after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he
related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible
Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting
monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds
most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters ―Cthulhu‖ and ―R’lyeh‖.
On March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his
quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the
home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other
artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness
and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close
watch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to
be in charge. The youth‘s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the
doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of
what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing ―miles high‖ which
walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic
words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the
nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this
object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man‘s subsidence into
lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but his whole
condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.
On April 2nd at about 3 p.m. every trace of Wilcox‘s malady suddenly ceased. He sat upright
in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in
dream or reality since the night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned
to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further assistance. All
traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of
his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual
visions.
Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the scattered notes
gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained scepticism then
forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in
question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period
as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly
instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he
could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates
of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have been
varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man
could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved, but
his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and
business—New England‘s traditional ―salt of the earth‖—gave an almost completely negative
result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and
there, always between March 23d and April 2nd—the period of young Wilcox‘s delirium.
Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest
fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of
something abnormal.
It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that panic would
have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their original
letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited
the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I
continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had
possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told
a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed
very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the
period of the sculptor‘s delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported
scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the
dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One
case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known
architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of
young Wilcox‘s seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be
saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name
instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal
investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however,
bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor‘s
questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach
them.
The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity
during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the
number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here
was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a
shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where
a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California
describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some ―glorious
fulfilment‖ which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native
unrest toward the end of March. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report
ominous mutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about
this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March
22–23. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter
named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous ―Dream Landscape‖ in the Paris spring salon of
1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can
have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified
conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the
callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox
had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.
II. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.
The older matters which had made the sculptor‘s dream and bas-relief so significant to my
uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears,
Professor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the
unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as
―Cthulhu‖; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued
young Wilcox with queries and demands for data.
The earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American
Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one
of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was
one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the
convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.
The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting,
was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way from New
Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was
John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore
the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette
whose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse
had the least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was
prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was,
had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during
a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected
with it, that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally
unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo
circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured
members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any
antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down
the cult to its fountain-head.
Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created. One
sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of
tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive
figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at
unopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible
object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish
surface of unplaceable stone.
The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was
between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship. It
represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose
face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore
feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and
unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a
rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings
touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved
claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of
the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so
that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the
croucher‘s elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more
subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable
age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to
civilisation‘s youth—or indeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material
was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and
striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base
were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world‘s
expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic
kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and
distinct from mankind as we know it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed
cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part.
And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector‘s
problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in
the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle
he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in
Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged,
forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic
inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had
encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form
of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a
faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders,
saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made.
Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals
addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a
careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in
Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which
this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the
ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous
picture and some cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all
essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.
This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members, proved
doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with
questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshippers his men
had arrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken
down amongst the diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of
details, and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the
virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart.
What, in substance, both the Esquimau wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had
chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this—the word-divisions being guessed
at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud:
―Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”
Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his mongrel
prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This
text, as given, ran something like this:
―In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”
And now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related as fully as
possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a story to which I could see my
uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and
theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-
castes and pariahs as might be expected to possess it.
On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons from
the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-
natured descendants of Lafitte‘s men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing
which had stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more
terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had
disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the
black haunted woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing
screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger
added, the people could stand it no more.
So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late
afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable road they
alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day
never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now
and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid
habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to
create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and
hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat
of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent
intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale
undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again,
each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the
scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on
unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before.
The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially
unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by
mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and
squatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it
at midnight. They said it had been there before D‘Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians,
and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and to
see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The
present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location
was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters
more than the shocking sounds and incidents.
Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse‘s men as they
ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tom-toms. There
are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to
hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic licence here
whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and
reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.
Now and then the less organised ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled
chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:
―Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”
Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of
the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry
which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water
on the face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.
In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre‘s extent, clear of
trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human
abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid
spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire; in the
centre of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite
monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous with its diminutiveness,
rested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular
intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the oddly marred
bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of
worshippers jumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to
right in endless Bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.
It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of
the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from
some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This
man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative.
He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining
eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been
hearing too much native superstition.
Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration. Duty came first;
and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the
police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five
minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots
were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-
seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows
of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried
away on improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of
course, was carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse.
Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved
to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and
a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the
Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before
many questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than
negro fetichism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with
surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.
They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any
men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now,
inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to
the first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners
said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places
all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the
mighty city of R‘lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his
sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always
be waiting to liberate him.
Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could not extract.
Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes came out
of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever
seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or not the
others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by
word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud, only
whispered. The chant meant only this: ―In his house at R‘lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.‖
Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest were
committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the
killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial
meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could
ever be gained. What the police did extract, came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo
named Castro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of
the cult in the mountains of China.
Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists
and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when
other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the
deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in
the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which
could revive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of
eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with
Them.
These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh and blood.
They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that shape was not
made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the
sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived,
They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R‘lyeh,
preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the
earth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must
serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them
from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst
uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, but
Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When,
after infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among
them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of
mammals.
Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small idols which the Great
Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars. That cult would never die till
the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to
revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then
mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil,
with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then
the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy
themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.
Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways
and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.
In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams, but then
something had happened. The great stone city R‘lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchres, had
sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which
not even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and
high-priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of
the earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up in
caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut
himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this
direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said
that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of
Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was
virtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the
deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad
Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-
discussed couplet:
That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.‖
Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning the
historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when he said that it was
wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon either cult or
image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with
no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb.
The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse‘s tale, corroborated as it was by the
statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended; although scant
mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. Caution is the first care of those
accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the
image to Professor Webb, but at the latter‘s death it was returned to him and remains in his
possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to
the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.
That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts must
arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive
young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found
image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the
precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans?
Professor Angell‘s instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently
natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect
way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my
uncle‘s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of
course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the
whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after
thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and
anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see
the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned
and aged man.
Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian
imitation of seventeenth-century Breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst
the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest
Georgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from
the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I
believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in
clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen
evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.
Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me
my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest; for my
uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the
reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some
subtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he
spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum
had influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost
made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the
original of this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed
themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in
delirium. That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle‘s relentless
catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which
he could possibly have received the weird impressions.
He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible vividness
the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry, he oddly said, was all
wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from
underground: ―Cthulhu fhtagn‖, ―Cthulhu fhtagn‖. These words had formed part of that dread
ritual which told of dead Cthulhu‘s dream-vigil in his stone vault at R‘lyeh, and I felt deeply
moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual
way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining.
Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams,
in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle
had been a very innocent one. The youth was of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly
ill-mannered, which I could never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius
and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent
promises.
The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of personal
fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New Orleans, talked with
Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even
questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had
been dead for some years. What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really
no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt
sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose
discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute
materialism, as I wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the
coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell.
One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle‘s death was far
from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming
with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed
blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to
learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic
rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in Norway a certain
seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after
encountering the sculptor‘s data have come to sinister ears? I think Professor Angell died
because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go
as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.
III. The Madness from the Sea.
If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere
chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I
would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an
Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting
bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle‘s
research.
I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the ―Cthulhu Cult‖, and
was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a
mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage
shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old
papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend
has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a
hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.
Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was
disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous
significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as
follows:
MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA. Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New
Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of
Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of
Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.
The Morrison Co.‘s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf
in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert
of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21', W. Longitude 152° 17'
with one living and one dead man aboard.
The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven considerably south of her
course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was
sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in
a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week.
The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height,
regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum
in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the
cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.
This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and
slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second
mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th
with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south
of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49° 51', W.
Longitude 128° 34', encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of
Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;
whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner
with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht‘s equipment. The
Emma‘s men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink from
shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her,
grappling with the savage crew on the yacht‘s deck, and being forced to kill them all, the
number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though
rather clumsy mode of fighting.
Three of the Emma‘s men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, were killed; and the
remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht,
going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed.
The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to
exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is
queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm.
Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her, but were
beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time till his rescue on the 12th the man
remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion, died.
Briden‘s death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure.
Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader,
and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-
castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity; and it
had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st. Our Auckland
correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Johansen is
described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole
matter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak
more freely than he has done hitherto.
This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of ideas it started
in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had
strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order
back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on
which six of the Emma‘s crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so
secretive? What had the vice-admiralty‘s investigation brought out, and what was known of
the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural
linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various
turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?
March 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—the earthquake and
storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if
imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to
dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the
form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23d the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island
and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened
vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster‘s malign pursuit, whilst an architect had
gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this storm of April
2nd—the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed
from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those hints of old Castro about
the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and their mastery of
dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man‘s power to bear? If so,
they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April had put a stop to
whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind‘s soul.
That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a
train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that
little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns.
Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about
one inland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were
noted on the distant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair
turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter
sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring
experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all
they could do was to give me his Oslo address.
After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the vice-
admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney
Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttlefish
head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at
Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship,
and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of material
which I had noted in Legrasse‘s smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator told me, had found
it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a
shudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones: ―They had come
from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.‖
Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to visit
Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for the Norwegian capital;
and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen‘s
address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the
name of Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as ―Christiana‖. I
made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and
ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons,
and I was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf
Johansen was no more.
He had not survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in 1925 had broken him. He
had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of ―technical
matters‖ as he said—written in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of
casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of
papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped
him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians found no
adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution.
I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I, too, am at rest;
―accidentally‖ or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connexion with her husband‘s
―technical matters‖ was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away
and began to read it on the London boat. It was a simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor‘s
effort at a post-facto diary—and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot
attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist
enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessel‘s sides became so
unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.
Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and the Thing, but I
shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in
time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream
beneath the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on
the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the
sun and air.
Johansen‘s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast,
had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born
tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men‘s
dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the
Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate‘s regret as he wrote of her bombardment and
sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was
some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a
duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against
his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their
captured yacht under Johansen‘s command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of
the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9', W. Longitude 126° 43' come upon a coast-line of mingled
mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible
substance of earth‘s supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R‘lyeh, that was built in
measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the
dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending
out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the
sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and
restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!
I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel whereon
great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent of all
that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men
were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must have
guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the
unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven
monolith, and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer
image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate‘s
frightened description.
Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he
spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on
broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces—surfaces too great to belong to any
thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I
mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful
dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-
Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an
unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.
Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and
clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase. The
very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out
from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those
crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first
shewed convexity.
Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than
rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the
others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for some
portable souvenir to bear away.
It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what
he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with
the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and
they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it,
though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside
cellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could
not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of
everything else seemed phantasmally variable.
Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt over it
delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed
interminably along the grotesque stone moulding—that is, one would call it climbing if the
thing was not after all horizontal—and the men wondered how any door in the universe could
be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top;
and they saw that it was balanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along
the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the
monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a
diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.
The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a
positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed,
and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun
as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The
odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared
Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and
everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed
Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that
poison city of madness.
Poor Johansen‘s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who
never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The
Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and
immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A
mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went
mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the
green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again,
and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by
accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.
Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest them, if there
be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Ångstrom. Parker slipped as
the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat,
and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn‘t have
been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and
Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous
monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water.
Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the
shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between
wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that
indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that
charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like
Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great
Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of
cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at
intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.
But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert
until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full
speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and
foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave
Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean
froth like the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came
nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a
bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of
a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an
instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a
venomous seething astern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless
sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened
every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.
That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a
few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate
after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the
storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of
spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a
comet‘s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again
to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the
green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.
Out of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin,
and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tell—they
would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must
not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.
That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief
and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine—this test of my own
sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I
have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and
the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be
long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult
still lives.
Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since
the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the
spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around
idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst
within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy.
Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness
waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will
come—but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript,
my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.

Pickman's Model
(1926)
You needn‘t think I‘m crazy, Eliot—plenty of others have queerer prejudices than this. Why
don‘t you laugh at Oliver‘s grandfather, who won‘t ride in a motor? If I don‘t like that damned
subway, it‘s my own business; and we got here more quickly anyhow in the taxi. We‘d have
had to walk up the hill from Park Street if we‘d taken the car.
I know I‘m more nervous than I was when you saw me last year, but you don‘t need to hold a
clinic over it. There‘s plenty of reason, God knows, and I fancy I‘m lucky to be sane at all. Why
the third degree? You didn‘t use to be so inquisitive.
Well, if you must hear it, I don‘t know why you shouldn‘t. Maybe you ought to, anyhow, for you
kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard I‘d begun to cut the Art Club and keep
away from Pickman. Now that he‘s disappeared I go around to the club once in a while, but
my nerves aren‘t what they were.
No, I don‘t know what‘s become of Pickman, and I don‘t like to guess. You might have
surmised I had some inside information when I dropped him—and that‘s why I don‘t want to
think where he‘s gone. Let the police find what they can—it won‘t be much, judging from the
fact that they don‘t know yet of the old North End place he hired under the name of Peters.
I‘m not sure that I could find it again myself—not that I‘d ever try, even in broad daylight! Yes, I
do know, or am afraid I know, why he maintained it. I‘m coming to that. And I think you‘ll
understand before I‘m through why I don‘t tell the police. They would ask me to guide them,
but I couldn‘t go back there even if I knew the way. There was something there—and now I
can‘t use the subway or (and you may as well have your laugh at this, too) go down into
cellars any more.
I should think you‘d have known I didn‘t drop Pickman for the same silly reasons that fussy
old women like Dr. Reid or Joe Minot or Bosworth did. Morbid art doesn‘t shock me, and when
a man has the genius Pickman had I feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction
his work takes. Boston never had a greater painter than Richard Upton Pickman. I said it at
first and I say it still, and I never swerved an inch, either, when he shewed that ―Ghoul
Feeding‖. That, you remember, was when Minot cut him.
You know, it takes profound art and profound insight into Nature to turn out stuff like
Pickman‘s. Any magazine-cover hack can splash paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or
a Witches‘ Sabbath or a portrait of the devil, but only a great painter can make such a thing
really scare or ring true. That‘s because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the
terrible or the physiology of fear—the exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with
latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting
effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness. I don‘t have to tell you why a Fuseli really
brings a shiver while a cheap ghost-story frontispiece merely makes us laugh. There‘s
something those fellows catch—beyond life—that they‘re able to make us catch for a second.
Doré had it. Sime has it. Angarola of Chicago has it. And Pickman had it as no man ever had
it before or—I hope to heaven—ever will again.
Don‘t ask me what it is they see. You know, in ordinary art, there‘s all the difference in the
world between the vital, breathing things drawn from Nature or models and the artificial truck
that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule. Well, I should say that the really
weird artist has a kind of vision which makes models, or summons up what amounts to actual
scenes from the spectral world he lives in. Anyhow, he manages to turn out results that differ
from the pretender‘s mince-pie dreams in just about the same way that the life painter‘s
results differ from the concoctions of a correspondence-school cartoonist. If I had ever seen
what Pickman saw—but no! Here, let‘s have a drink before we get any deeper. Gad, I
wouldn‘t be alive if I‘d ever seen what that man—if he was a man—saw!
You recall that Pickman‘s forte was faces. I don‘t believe anybody since Goya could put so
much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression. And before Goya you have to
go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and
Mont Saint-Michel. They believed all sorts of things—and maybe they saw all sorts of things,
too, for the Middle Ages had some curious phases. I remember your asking Pickman yourself
once, the year before you went away, wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions.
Wasn‘t that a nasty laugh he gave you? It was partly because of that laugh that Reid dropped
him. Reid, you know, had just taken up comparative pathology, and was full of pompous
―inside stuff‖ about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical
symptom. He said Pickman repelled him more and more every day, and almost frightened him
toward the last—that the fellow‘s features and expression were slowly developing in a way he
didn‘t like; in a way that wasn‘t human. He had a lot of talk about diet, and said Pickman must
be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree. I suppose you told Reid, if you and he had any
correspondence over it, that he‘d let Pickman‘s paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his
imagination. I know I told him that myself—then.
But keep in mind that I didn‘t drop Pickman for anything like this. On the contrary, my
admiration for him kept growing; for that ―Ghoul Feeding‖ was a tremendous achievement. As
you know, the club wouldn‘t exhibit it, and the Museum of Fine Arts wouldn‘t accept it as a gift;
and I can add that nobody would buy it, so Pickman had it right in his house till he went. Now
his father has it in Salem—you know Pickman comes of old Salem stock, and had a witch
ancestor hanged in 1692.
I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often, especially after I began making notes for
a monograph on weird art. Probably it was his work which put the idea into my head, and
anyhow, I found him a mine of data and suggestions when I came to develop it. He shewed
me all the paintings and drawings he had about; including some pen-and-ink sketches that
would, I verily believe, have got him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen
them. Before long I was pretty nearly a devotee, and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to
art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the Danvers asylum.
My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less
and less to do with him, made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted
that if I were fairly close-mouthed and none too squeamish, he might shew me something
rather unusual—something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house.
―You know,‖ he said, ―there are things that won‘t do for Newbury Street—things that are out of
place here, and that can‘t be conceived here, anyhow. It‘s my business to catch the overtones
of the soul, and you won‘t find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets on made land. Back
Bay isn‘t Boston—it isn‘t anything yet, because it‘s had no time to pick up memories and
attract local spirits. If there are any ghosts here, they‘re the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a
shallow cove; and I want human ghosts—the ghosts of beings highly organised enough to
have looked on hell and known the meaning of what they saw.
―The place for an artist to live is the North End. If any aesthete were sincere, he‘d put up with
the slums for the sake of the massed traditions. God, man! Don‘t you realise that places like
that weren‘t merely made, but actually grew? Generation after generation lived and felt and
died there, and in days when people weren‘t afraid to live and feel and die. Don‘t you know
there was a mill on Copp‘s Hill in 1632, and that half the present streets were laid out by
1650? I can shew you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and more; houses that
have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble into powder. What do moderns
know of life and the forces behind it? You call the Salem witchcraft a delusion, but I‘ll wage my
four-times-great-grandmother could have told you things. They hanged her on Gallows Hill,
with Cotton Mather looking sanctimoniously on. Mather, damn him, was afraid somebody
might succeed in kicking free of this accursed cage of monotony—I wish someone had laid a
spell on him or sucked his blood in the night!
―I can shew you a house he lived in, and I can shew you another one he was afraid to enter in
spite of all his fine bold talk. He knew things he didn‘t dare put into that stupid Magnalia or
that puerile Wonders of the Invisible World. Look here, do you know the whole North End
once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each other‘s houses, and the
burying-ground, and the sea? Let them prosecute and persecute above ground—things went
on every day that they couldn‘t reach, and voices laughed at night that they couldn‘t place!
―Why, man, out of ten surviving houses built before 1700 and not moved since I‘ll wager that
in eight I can shew you something queer in the cellar. There‘s hardly a month that you don‘t
read of workmen finding bricked-up arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old place
as it comes down—you could see one near Henchman Street from the elevated last year.
There were witches and what their spells summoned; pirates and what they brought in from
the sea; smugglers; privateers—and I tell you, people knew how to live, and how to enlarge
the bounds of life, in the old times! This wasn‘t the only world a bold and wise man could
know—faugh! And to think of today in contrast, with such pale-pink brains that even a club of
supposed artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes beyond the feelings of a
Beacon Street tea-table!
―The only saving grace of the present is that it‘s too damned stupid to question the past very
closely. What do maps and records and guide-books really tell of the North End? Bah! At a
guess I‘ll guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of Prince
Street that aren‘t suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them.
And what do those Dagoes know of their meaning? No, Thurber, these ancient places are
dreaming gorgeously and overflowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the
commonplace, and yet there‘s not a living soul to understand or profit by them. Or rather,
there‘s only one living soul—for I haven‘t been digging around in the past for nothing!
―See here, you‘re interested in this sort of thing. What if I told you that I‘ve got another studio
up there, where I can catch the night-spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn‘t
even think of in Newbury Street? Naturally I don‘t tell those cursed old maids at the club—with
Reid, damn him, whispering even as it is that I‘m a sort of monster bound down the toboggan
of reverse evolution. Yes, Thurber, I decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as
beauty from life, so I did some exploring in places where I had reason to know terror lives.
―I‘ve got a place that I don‘t believe three living Nordic men besides myself have ever seen. It
isn‘t so very far from the elevated as distance goes, but it‘s centuries away as the soul goes. I
took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar—one of the sort I told you about. The
shack‘s almost tumbling down, so that nobody else would live there, and I‘d hate to tell you
how little I pay for it. The windows are boarded up, but I like that all the better, since I don‘t
want daylight for what I do. I paint in the cellar, where the inspiration is thickest, but I‘ve other
rooms furnished on the ground floor. A Sicilian owns it, and I‘ve hired it under the name of
Peters.
―Now if you‘re game, I‘ll take you there tonight. I think you‘d enjoy the pictures, for as I said,
I‘ve let myself go a bit there. It‘s no vast tour—I sometimes do it on foot, for I don‘t want to
attract attention with a taxi in such a place. We can take the shuttle at the South Station for
Battery Street, and after that the walk isn‘t much.‖
Well, Eliot, there wasn‘t much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from
running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight. We changed to the elevated
at the South Station, and at about twelve o‘clock had climbed down the steps at Battery Street
and struck along the old waterfront past Constitution Wharf. I didn‘t keep track of the cross
streets, and can‘t tell you yet which it was we turned up, but I know it wasn‘t Greenough Lane.
When we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley I
ever saw in my life, with crumbling-looking gables, broken small-paned windows, and archaic
chimneys that stood out half-disintegrated against the moonlit sky. I don‘t believe there were
three houses in sight that hadn‘t been standing in Cotton Mather‘s time—certainly I glimpsed
at least two with an overhang, and once I thought I saw a peaked roof-line of the almost
forgotten pre-gambrel type, though antiquarians tell us there are none left in Boston.
From that alley, which had a dim light, we turned to the left into an equally silent and still
narrower alley with no light at all; and in a minute made what I think was an obtuse-angled
bend toward the right in the dark. Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight and
revealed an antediluvian ten-panelled door that looked damnably worm-eaten. Unlocking it,
he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid dark-oak panelling—
simple, of course, but thrillingly suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the
Witchcraft. Then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to
make myself at home.
Now, Eliot, I‘m what the man in the street would call fairly ―hard-boiled‖, but I‘ll confess that
what I saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn. They were his pictures, you know—
the ones he couldn‘t paint or even shew in Newbury Street—and he was right when he said
he had ―let himself go‖. Here—have another drink—I need one anyhow!
There‘s no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the awful, the
blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple
touches quite beyond the power of words to classify. There was none of the exotic technique
you see in Sidney Sime, none of the trans-Saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that Clark
Ashton Smith uses to freeze the blood. The backgrounds were mostly old churchyards, deep
woods, cliffs by the sea, brick tunnels, ancient panelled rooms, or simple vaults of masonry.
Copp‘s Hill Burying Ground, which could not be many blocks away from this very house, was
a favourite scene.
The madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground—for Pickman‘s morbid art
was preëminently one of daemoniac portraiture. These figures were seldom completely
human, but often approached humanity in varying degree. Most of the bodies, while roughly
bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a vaguely canine cast. The texture of the majority was a
kind of unpleasant rubberiness. Ugh! I can see them now! Their occupations—well, don‘t ask
me to be too precise. They were usually feeding—I won‘t say on what. They were sometimes
shewn in groups in cemeteries or underground passages, and often appeared to be in battle
over their prey—or rather, their treasure-trove. And what damnable expressiveness Pickman
sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty! Occasionally the things were shewn
leaping through open windows at night, or squatting on the chests of sleepers, worrying at
their throats. One canvas shewed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on Gallows Hill,
whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs.
But don‘t get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck
me faint. I‘m not a three-year-old kid, and I‘d seen much like this before. It was the faces,
Eliot, those accursed faces, that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of
life! By God, man, I verily believe they were alive! That nauseous wizard had waked the fires
of hell in pigment, and his brush had been a nightmare-spawning wand. Give me that
decanter, Eliot!
There was one thing called ―The Lesson‖—heaven pity me, that I ever saw it! Listen—can you
fancy a squatting circle of nameless dog-like things in a churchyard teaching a small child
how to feed like themselves? The price of a changeling, I suppose—you know the old myth
about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes
they steal. Pickman was shewing what happens to those stolen babes—how they grow up—
and then I began to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and non-human
figures. He was, in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly non-human and the
degradedly human, establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution. The dog-things were
developed from mortals!
And no sooner had I wondered what he made of their own young as left with mankind in the
form of changelings, than my eye caught a picture embodying that very thought. It was that of
an ancient Puritan interior—a heavily beamed room with lattice windows, a settle, and clumsy
seventeenth-century furniture, with the family sitting about while the father read from the
Scriptures. Every face but one shewed nobility and reverence, but that one reflected the
mockery of the pit. It was that of a young man in years, and no doubt belonged to a supposed
son of that pious father, but in essence it was the kin of the unclean things. It was their
changeling—and in a spirit of supreme irony Pickman had given the features a very
perceptible resemblance to his own.
By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open
the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his ―modern studies‖. I hadn‘t been able to
give him much of my opinions—I was too speechless with fright and loathing—but I think he
fully understood and felt highly complimented. And now I want to assure you again, Eliot, that
I‘m no mollycoddle to scream at anything which shews a bit of departure from the usual. I‘m
middle-aged and decently sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough of me in France to
know I‘m not easily knocked out. Remember, too, that I‘d just about recovered my wind and
gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial New England into a kind of annex
of hell. Well, in spite of all this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to
clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over. The other chamber had shewn a pack of
ghouls and witches overrunning the world of our forefathers, but this one brought the horror
right into our own daily life!
Gad, how that man could paint! There was a study called ―Subway Accident‖, in which a flock
of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown catacomb through a crack in the
floor of the Boylston Street subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform. Another
shewed a dance on Copp‘s Hill among the tombs with the background of today. Then there
were any number of cellar views, with monsters creeping in through holes and rifts in the
masonry and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first
victim to descend the stairs.
One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross-section of Beacon Hill, with ant-like
armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed
the ground. Dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured, and another conception
somehow shocked me more than all the rest—a scene in an unknown vault, where scores of
the beasts crowded about one who held a well-known Boston guide-book and was evidently
reading aloud. All were pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted
with epileptic and reverberant laughter that I almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes. The
title of the picture was, ―Holmes, Lowell, and Longfellow Lie Buried in Mount Auburn‖.
As I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and
morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing. In the first place, I
said to myself, these things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous cruelty they
shewed in Pickman. The fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in
the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement. In the second place,
they terrified because of their very greatness. Their art was the art that convinced—when we
saw the pictures we saw the daemons themselves and were afraid of them. And the queer
part was, that Pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie.
Nothing was blurred, distorted, or conventionalised; outlines were sharp and life-like, and
details were almost painfully defined. And the faces!
It was not any mere artist‘s interpretation that we saw; it was pandemonium itself, crystal clear
in stark objectivity. That was it, by heaven! The man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at
all—he did not even try to give us the churning, prismatic ephemera of dreams, but coldly and
sardonically reflected some stable, mechanistic, and well-established horror-world which he
saw fully, brilliantly, squarely, and unfalteringly. God knows what that world can have been, or
where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through
it; but whatever the baffling source of his images, one thing was plain. Pickman was in every
sense—in conception and in execution—a thorough, painstaking, and almost scientific realist.
My host was now leading the way down cellar to his actual studio, and I braced myself for
some hellish effects among the unfinished canvases. As we reached the bottom of the damp
stairs he turned his flashlight to a corner of the large open space at hand, revealing the
circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor. We walked nearer,
and I saw that it must be five feet across, with walls a good foot thick and some six inches
above the ground level—solid work of the seventeenth century, or I was much mistaken. That,
Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking about—an aperture of the network of
tunnels that used to undermine the hill. I noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up, and
that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover. Thinking of the things this well must
have been connected with if Pickman‘s wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered
slightly; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size,
provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio. An acetylene gas outfit gave the light
necessary for work.
The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the
finished ones upstairs, and shewed the painstaking methods of the artist. Scenes were
blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which
Pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions. The man was great—I say it
even now, knowing as much as I do. A large camera on a table excited my notice, and
Pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them
from photographs in the studio instead of carting his outfit around the town for this or that
view. He thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work,
and declared he employed them regularly.
There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished
monstrosities that leered around from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly
unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a
loud scream—the second I had emitted that night. It echoed and echoed through the dim
vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction that
threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter. Merciful Creator! Eliot, but I don‘t know how
much was real and how much was feverish fancy. It doesn‘t seem to me that earth can hold a
dream like that!
It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a
thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy. Its
position was a kind of crouch, and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its
present prey and seek a juicier morsel. But damn it all, it wasn‘t even the fiendish subject that
made it such an immortal fountain-head of all panic—not that, nor the dog face with its
pointed ears, bloodshot eyes, flat nose, and drooling lips. It wasn‘t the scaly claws nor the
mould-caked body nor the half-hooved feet—none of these, though any one of them might
well have driven an excitable man to madness.
It was the technique, Eliot—the cursed, the impious, the unnatural technique! As I am a living
being, I never elsewhere saw the actual breath of life so fused into a canvas. The monster
was there—it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared—and I knew that only a suspension
of Nature‘s laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model—without some
glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the Fiend has ever had.
Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly
curled up—probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman meant to paint a
background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance. I reached out to uncurl and look
at it, when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if shot. He had been listening with peculiar
intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar,
and now he seemed struck with a fright which, though not comparable to my own, had in it
more of the physical than of the spiritual. He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence,
then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him.
I think I was paralysed for an instant. Imitating Pickman‘s listening, I fancied I heard a faint
scurrying sound somewhere, and a series of squeals or bleats in a direction I couldn‘t
determine. I thought of huge rats and shuddered. Then there came a subdued sort of clatter
which somehow set me all in gooseflesh—a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though I can‘t
attempt to convey what I mean in words. It was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick—
wood on brick—what did that make me think of?
It came again, and louder. There was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had
fallen before. After that followed a sharp grating noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and
the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion-tamer
might fire in the air for effect. A muffled squeal or squawk, and a thud. Then more wood and
brick grating, a pause, and the opening of the door—at which I‘ll confess I started violently.
Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that infested the
ancient well.
―The deuce knows what they eat, Thurber,‖ he grinned, ―for those archaic tunnels touched
graveyard and witch-den and sea-coast. But whatever it is, they must have run short, for they
were devilish anxious to get out. Your yelling stirred them up, I fancy. Better be cautious in
these old places—our rodent friends are the one drawback, though I sometimes think they‘re
a positive asset by way of atmosphere and colour.‖
Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night‘s adventure. Pickman had promised to shew me the
place, and heaven knows he had done it. He led me out of that tangle of alleys in another
direction, it seems, for when we sighted a lamp post we were in a half-familiar street with
monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses. Charter Street, it turned out to
be, but I was too flustered to notice just where we hit it. We were too late for the elevated, and
walked back downtown through Hanover Street. I remember that walk. We switched from
Tremont up Beacon, and Pickman left me at the corner of Joy, where I turned off. I never
spoke to him again.
Why did I drop him? Don‘t be impatient. Wait till I ring for coffee. We‘ve had enough of the
other stuff, but I for one need something. No—it wasn‘t the paintings I saw in that place;
though I‘ll swear they were enough to get him ostracised in nine-tenths of the homes and
clubs of Boston, and I guess you won‘t wonder now why I have to steer clear of subways and
cellars. It was—something I found in my coat the next morning. You know, the curled-up
paper tacked to that frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of
some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster. That last scare had come
while I was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems I had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket. But
here‘s the coffee—take it black, Eliot, if you‘re wise.
Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton Pickman, the greatest
artist I have ever known—and the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the
pits of myth and madness. Eliot—old Reid was right. He wasn‘t strictly human. Either he was
born in strange shadow, or he‘d found a way to unlock the forbidden gate. It‘s all the same
now, for he‘s gone—back into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt. Here, let‘s have the
chandelier going.
Don‘t ask me to explain or even conjecture about what I burned. Don‘t ask me, either, what
lay behind that mole-like scrambling Pickman was so keen to pass off as rats. There are
secrets, you know, which might have come down from old Salem times, and Cotton Mather
tells even stranger things. You know how damned life-like Pickman‘s paintings were—how we
all wondered where he got those faces.
Well—that paper wasn‘t a photograph of any background, after all. What it shewed was
simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas. It was the model he was
using—and its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail. But by
God, Eliot, it was a photograph from life.

The Silver Key
(1926)
When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams. Prior to that time he
had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to strange and ancient cities
beyond space, and lovely, unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age
hardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by little, until at last he was cut
off altogether. No more could his galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of
Thran, or his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where forgotten
palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon.
He had read much of things as they are, and talked with too many people. Well-meaning
philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things, and analyse the
processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies. Wonder had gone away, and he had
forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no difference
betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings, and no cause to value
the one above the other. Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that
which tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in visions.
Wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and childish, and he believed it because he
could see that they might easily be so. What he failed to recall was that the deeds of reality
are just as inane and childish, and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying
them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly on from nothing to
something and from something back to nothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the
wishes or existence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness.
They had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained the workings of those
things till mystery had gone out of the world. When he complained, and longed to escape into
twilight realms where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of
his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight, they turned him
instead toward the new-found prodigies of science, bidding him find wonder in the atom‘s
vortex and mystery in the sky‘s dimensions. And when he had failed to find these boons in
things whose laws are known and measurable, they told him he lacked imagination, and was
immature because he preferred dream-illusions to the illusions of our physical creation.
So Carter had tried to do as others did, and pretended that the common events and emotions
of earthy minds were more important than the fantasies of rare and delicate souls. He did not
dissent when they told him that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic ploughman in real
life is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of Narath with its hundred carven gates and
domes of chalcedony, which he dimly remembered from his dreams; and under their guidance
he cultivated a painstaking sense of pity and tragedy.
Once in a while, though, he could not help seeing how shallow, fickle, and meaningless all
human aspirations are, and how emptily our real impulses contrast with those pompous ideals
we profess to hold. Then he would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to
use against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw that the daily life of our
world is every inch as extravagant and artificial, and far less worthy of respect because of its
poverty in beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and purpose. In this
way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see that even humour is empty in a
mindless universe devoid of any true standard of consistency or inconsistency.
In the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith endeared to him by
the naive trust of his fathers, for thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise
escape from life. Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and
prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned
boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the
awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses
of a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly people tried
to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted,
and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient
creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true
guise of ethereal fantasy.
But when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths, he found them even
more ugly than those who had not. They did not know that beauty lies in harmony, and that
loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the
dreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of
the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only
ornamental fruits of perspective, whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made
our fathers think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race and culture.
Instead, they either denied these things altogether or transferred them to the crude, vague
instincts which they shared with the beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged
malodorously out in pain, ugliness, and disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous pride at
having escaped from something no more unsound than that which still held them. They had
traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of licence and anarchy.
Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their cheapness and squalor
sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which
their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had
discarded. He saw that most of them, in common with their cast-off priestcraft, could not
escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and
could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even
when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their
scientific discoveries. Warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and
consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped
to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and
judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims
or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial settings, their lives grew void of
direction and dramatic interest; till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and
pretended usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal sensation. When
these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous through revulsion, they cultivated irony
and bitterness, and found fault with the social order. Never could they realise that their brute
foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders, and that the
satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream,
and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the
secrets of childhood and innocence.
Amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen
thought and good heritage. With his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not
believe in anything, but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and
station. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed because no vista seemed
fully real; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded
plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known,
and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find. Travel was only
a mockery; and even the Great War stirred him but little, though he served from the first in the
Foreign Legion of France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the
crudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their visions. He felt
vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him, for they could not
have understood his mental life. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher
could, and they were long dead.
Then he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off when dreams first failed
him. But here, too, was there no satisfaction or fulfilment; for the touch of earth was upon his
mind, and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore. Ironic humour dragged
down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the
delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens. The convention of assumed pity spilt
mawkishness on his characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant human
events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled allegory and cheap social
satire. His new novels were successful as his old ones had never been; and because he
knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his
writing. They were very graceful novels, in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he lightly
sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all their life away.
It was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre
and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace. Most of these, however, soon shewed
their poverty and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry
and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem
them. Gross stupidity, falsehood, and muddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape
from life to a mind trained above their level. So Carter bought stranger books and sought out
deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving into arcana of consciousness that
few have trod, and learning things about the secret pits of life, legend, and immemorial
antiquity which disturbed him ever afterward. He decided to live on a rarer plane, and
furnished his Boston home to suit his changing moods; one room for each, hung in
appropriate colours, furnished with befitting books and objects, and provided with sources of
the proper sensations of light, heat, sound, taste, and odour.
Once he heard of a man in the South who was shunned and feared for the blasphemous
things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from India and Arabia. Him he
visited, living with him and sharing his studies for seven years, till horror overtook them one
midnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard, and only one emerged where two had
entered. Then he went back to Arkham, the terrible witch-haunted old town of his forefathers
in New England, and had experiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering
gambrel roofs, which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a wild-minded
ancestor. But these horrors took him only to the edge of reality, and were not of the true
dream country he had known in youth; so that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment
in a world grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dream.
Having perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things, Carter spent his days in
retirement, and in wistful disjointed memories of his dream-filled youth. He thought it rather
silly that he bothered to keep on living at all, and got from a South American acquaintance a
very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without suffering. Inertia and force of habit, however,
caused him to defer action; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times, taking
down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in his early
boyhood—purple panes, Victorian furniture, and all.
With the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered, for his relics of youth and
his cleavage from the world made life and sophistication seem very distant and unreal; so
much so that a touch of magic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers. For years
those slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of every-day things as the
commonest slumbers know, but now there returned a flicker of something stranger and wilder;
something of vaguely awesome immanence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from
his childhood days, and made him think of little inconsequential things he had long forgotten.
He would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather, both in their graves a quarter of
a century.
Then one night his grandfather reminded him of a key. The grey old scholar, as vivid as in life,
spoke long and earnestly of their ancient line, and of the strange visions of the delicate and
sensitive men who composed it. He spoke of the flame-eyed Crusader who learnt wild secrets
of the Saracens that held him captive; and of the first Sir Randolph Carter who studied magic
when Elizabeth was queen. He spoke, too, of that Edmund Carter who had just escaped
hanging in the Salem witchcraft, and who had placed in an antique box a great silver key
handed down from his ancestors. Before Carter awaked, the gentle visitant had told him
where to find that box; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand
had raised for two centuries.
In the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it, remote and forgotten at the back of a
drawer in a tall chest. It was about a foot square, and its Gothic carvings were so fearful that
he did not marvel no person since Edmund Carter had dared to open it. It gave forth no noise
when shaken, but was mystic with the scent of unremembered spices. That it held a key was
indeed only a dim legend, and Randolph Carter‘s father had never known such a box existed.
It was bound in rusty iron, and no means was provided for working the formidable lock. Carter
vaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost gate of dreams, but of
where and how to use it his grandfather had told him nothing.
An old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the hideous faces leering from
the blackened wood, and at some unplaced familiarity. Inside, wrapped in a discoloured
parchment, was a huge key of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques; but of any
legible explanation there was none. The parchment was voluminous, and held only the
strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an antique reed. Carter recognised the
characters as those he had seen on a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar
of the South who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery. The man had always
shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now.
But he cleaned the key, and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box of ancient oak. His
dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and though shewing him none of the strange
cities and incredible gardens of the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose
could not be mistaken. They were calling him back along the years, and with the mingled wills
of all his fathers were pulling him toward some hidden and ancestral source. Then he knew
he must go into the past and merge himself with old things, and day after day he thought of
the hills to the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing Miskatonic and the lonely rustic
homestead of his people lay.
In the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way past graceful lines of
rolling hill and stone-walled meadow, distant vale and hanging woodland, curving road and
nestling farmstead, and the crystal windings of the Miskatonic, crossed here and there by
rustic bridges of wood or stone. At one bend he saw the group of giant elms among which an
ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before, and shuddered as the wind blew
meaningly through them. Then there was the crumbling farmhouse of old Goody Fowler the
witch, with its little evil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north side.
He speeded up his car as he passed it, and did not slacken till he had mounted the hill where
his mother and her fathers before her were born, and where the old white house still looked
proudly across the road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant valley,
with the distant spires of Kingsport on the horizon, and hints of the archaic, dream-laden sea
in the farthest background.
Then came the steeper slope that held the old Carter place he had not seen in over forty
years. Afternoon was far gone when he reached the foot, and at the bend half way up he
paused to scan the outspread countryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic
poured out by a western sun. All the strangeness and expectancy of his recent dreams
seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape, and he thought of the unknown
solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced out the velvet and deserted lawns shining
undulant between their tumbled walls, the clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of purple
hills beyond hills, and the spectral wooded valley dipping down in shadow to dank hollows
where trickling waters crooned and gurgled among swollen and distorted roots.
Something made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was seeking, so he left
his car at the edge of the forest, and putting the great key in his coat pocket walked on up the
hill. Woods now engulfed him utterly, though he knew the house was on a high knoll that
cleared the trees except to the north. He wondered how it would look, for it had been left
vacant and untended through his neglect since the death of his strange great-uncle
Christopher thirty years before. In his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there, and
had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard.
Shadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap in the trees opened up to
the right, so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and spied the old
Congregational steeple on Central Hill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes
of the little round windows blazing with reflected fire. Then, when he was in deep shadow
again, he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have come from childish memory alone,
since the old white church had long been torn down to make room for the Congregational
Hospital. He had read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange burrows or
passages found in the rocky hill beneath.
Through his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its familiarity after long years.
Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle Christopher‘s hired man, and was aged even in those
far-off times of his boyhood visits. Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping voice
could come from no one else. He could distinguish no words, yet the tone was haunting and
unmistakable. To think that ―Old Benijy‖ should still be alive!
―Mister Randy! Mister Randy! Whar be ye? D‘ye want to skeer yer Aunt Marthy plumb to
death? Hain‘t she tuld ye to keep nigh the place in the arternoon an‘ git back afur dark?
Randy! Ran . . . dee! . . . He‘s the beatin‘est boy fer runnin‘ off in the woods I ever see; haff
the time a-settin‘ moonin‘ raound that snake-den in the upper timber-lot! . . . Hey, yew, Ran . .
. dee!‖
Randolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his eyes.
Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought not to be; had strayed very far
away to places where he had not belonged, and was now inexcusably late. He had not
noticed the time on the Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with his
pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very strange and unprecedented.
He was not sure he had his little telescope with him, and put his hand in his blouse pocket to
see. No, it was not there, but there was the big silver key he had found in a box somewhere.
Uncle Chris had told him something odd once about an old unopened box with a key in it, but
Aunt Martha had stopped the story abruptly, saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose
head was already too full of queer fancies. He tried to recall just where he had found the key,
but something seemed very confused. He guessed it was in the attic at home in Boston, and
dimly remembered bribing Parks with half his week‘s allowance to help him open the box and
keep quiet about it; but when he remembered this, the face of Parks came up very strangely,
as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk little Cockney.
―Ran . . . dee! Ran . . . dee! Hi! Hi! Randy!‖
A swaying lantern came around the black bend, and old Benijah pounced on the silent and
bewildered form of the pilgrim.
―Durn ye, boy, so thar ye be! Ain‘t ye got a tongue in yer head, that ye can‘t answer a body? I
ben callin‘ this haff hour, an‘ ye must a heerd me long ago! Dun‘t ye know yer Aunt Marthy‘s
all a-fidget over yer bein‘ off arter dark? Wait till I tell yer Uncle Chris when he gits hum! Ye‘d
orta know these here woods ain‘t no fitten place to be traipsin‘ this hour! They‘s things abroad
what dun‘t do nobody no good, as my gran‘sir‘ knowed afur me. Come, Mister Randy, or
Hannah wun‘t keep supper no longer!‖
So Randolph Carter was marched up the road where wondering stars glimmered through high
autumn boughs. And dogs barked as the yellow light of small-paned windows shone out at the
farther turn, and the Pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood
black against the dim west. Aunt Martha was in the doorway, and did not scold too hard when
Benijah shoved the truant in. She knew Uncle Chris well enough to expect such things of the
Carter blood. Randolph did not shew his key, but ate his supper in silence and protested only
when bedtime came. He sometimes dreamed better when awake, and he wanted to use that
key.
In the morning Randolph was up early, and would have run off to the upper timber-lot if Uncle
Chris had not caught him and forced him into his chair by the breakfast table. He looked
impatiently around the low-pitched room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and corner-
posts, and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the leaded panes of the rear
window. The trees and the hills were close to him, and formed the gates of that timeless realm
which was his true country.
Then, when he was free, he felt in his blouse pocket for the key; and being reassured,
skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond, where the wooded hill climbed again to
heights above even the treeless knoll. The floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious, and
great lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like Druid monoliths among
the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove. Once in his ascent Randolph crossed a
rushing stream whose falls a little way off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and
aegipans and dryads.
Then he came to the strange cave in the forest slope, the dreaded ―snake-den‖ which country
folk shunned, and away from which Benijah had warned him again and again. It was deep; far
deeper than anyone but Randolph suspected, for the boy had found a fissure in the
farthermost black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond—a haunting sepulchral place
whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious artifice. On this occasion he crawled
in as usual, lighting his way with matches filched from the sitting-room match-safe, and
edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to himself. He could
not tell why he approached the farther wall so confidently, or why he instinctively drew forth
the great silver key as he did so. But on he went, and when he danced back to the house that
night he offered no excuses for his lateness, nor heeded in the least the reproofs he gained
for ignoring the noontide dinner-horn altogether.
—
Now it is agreed by all the distant relatives of Randolph Carter that something occurred to
heighten his imagination in his tenth year. His cousin, Ernest B. Aspinwall, Esq., of Chicago, is
fully ten years his senior; and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn of 1883.
Randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can ever have beheld, and
stranger still were some of the qualities which he shewed in relation to very mundane things.
He seemed, in fine, to have picked up an odd gift of prophecy; and reacted unusually to
things which, though at the time without meaning, were later found to justify the singular
impressions. In subsequent decades as new inventions, new names, and new events
appeared one by one in the book of history, people would now and then recall wonderingly
how Carter had years before let fall some careless word of undoubted connexion with what
was then far in the future. He did not himself understand these words, or know why certain
things made him feel certain emotions; but fancied that some unremembered dream must be
responsible. It was as early as 1897 that he turned pale when some traveller mentioned the
French town of Belloy-en-Santerre, and friends remembered it when he was almost mortally
wounded there in 1916, while serving with the Foreign Legion in the Great War.
Carter‘s relatives talk much of these things because he has lately disappeared. His little old
servant Parks, who for years bore patiently with his vagaries, last saw him on the morning he
drove off alone in his car with a key he had recently found. Parks had helped him get the key
from the old box containing it, and had felt strangely affected by the grotesque carvings on the
box, and by some other odd quality he could not name. When Carter left, he had said he was
going to visit his old ancestral country around Arkham.
Half way up Elm Mountain, on the way to the ruins of the old Carter place, they found his
motor set carefully by the roadside; and in it was a box of fragrant wood with carvings that
frightened the countrymen who stumbled on it. The box held only a queer parchment whose
characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher or identify. Rain had long
effaced any possible footprints, though Boston investigators had something to say about
evidences of disturbances among the fallen timbers of the Carter place. It was, they averred,
as though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant period. A common white
handkerchief found among forest rocks on the hillside beyond cannot be identified as
belonging to the missing man.
There is talk of apportioning Randolph Carter‘s estate among his heirs, but I shall stand firmly
against this course because I do not believe he is dead. There are twists of time and space, of
vision and reality, which only a dreamer can divine; and from what I know of Carter I think he
has merely found a way to traverse these mazes. Whether or not he will ever come back, I
cannot say. He wanted the lands of dream he had lost, and yearned for the days of his
childhood. Then he found a key, and I somehow believe he was able to use it to strange
advantage.
I shall ask him when I see him, for I expect to meet him shortly in a certain dream-city we both
used to haunt. It is rumoured in Ulthar, beyond the river Skai, that a new king reigns on the
opal throne in Ilek-Vad, that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking
the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny Gnorri build their singular labyrinths, and I
believe I know how to interpret this rumour. Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the sight of
that great silver key, for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolised all the aims
and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos.

The Strange High House in the Mist
(1926)
In the morning mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond Kingsport. White and feathery
it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds, full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of
leviathan. And later, in still summer rains on the steep roofs of poets, the clouds scatter bits of
those dreams, that men shall not live without rumour of old, strange secrets, and wonders that
planets tell planets alone in the night. When tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and
conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager
mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic
whiteness, as if the cliff‘s rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled
free in the aether of faery.
Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious, terrace on terrace, till the
northernmost hangs in the sky like a grey frozen wind-cloud. Alone it is, a bleak point jutting in
limitless space, for there the coast turns sharp where the great Miskatonic pours out of the
plains past Arkham, bringing woodland legends and little quaint memories of New England‘s
hills. The sea-folk in Kingsport look up at that cliff as other sea-folk look up at the pole-star,
and time the night‘s watches by the way it hides or shews the Great Bear, Cassiopeia, and
the Dragon. Among them it is one with the firmament, and truly, it is hidden from them when
the mist hides the stars or the sun. Some of the cliffs they love, as that whose grotesque
profile they call Father Neptune, or that whose pillared steps they term The Causeway; but
this one they fear because it is so near the sky. The Portuguese sailors coming in from a
voyage cross themselves when they first see it, and the old Yankees believe it would be much
graver matter than death to climb it, if indeed that were possible. Nevertheless there is an
ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the small-paned windows.
The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells therein who talks with
the morning mists that come up from the deep, and perhaps sees singular things oceanward
at those times when the cliff‘s rim becomes the rim of all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in
the white aether of faery. This they tell from hearsay, for that forbidding crag is always
unvisited, and natives dislike to train telescopes on it. Summer boarders have indeed
scanned it with jaunty binoculars, but have never seen more than the grey primeval roof,
peaked and shingled, whose eaves come nearly to the grey foundations, and the dim yellow
light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the dusk. These summer
people do not believe that the same One has lived in the ancient house for hundreds of years,
but cannot prove their heresy to any real Kingsporter. Even the Terrible Old Man who talks to
leaden pendulums in bottles, buys groceries with centuried Spanish gold, and keeps stone
idols in the yard of his antediluvian cottage in Water Street can only say these things were the
same when his grandfather was a boy, and that must have been inconceivable ages ago,
when Belcher or Shirley or Pownall or Bernard was Governor of His Majesty‘s Province of the
Massachusetts-Bay.
Then one summer there came a philosopher into Kingsport. His name was Thomas Olney,
and he taught ponderous things in a college by Narragansett Bay. With stout wife and
romping children he came, and his eyes were weary with seeing the same things for many
years, and thinking the same well-disciplined thoughts. He looked at the mists from the
diadem of Father Neptune, and tried to walk into their white world of mystery along the titan
steps of The Causeway. Morning after morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the
world‘s rim at the cryptical aether beyond, listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what
might have been gulls. Then, when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the
smoke of steamers, he would sigh and descend to the town, where he loved to thread the
narrow olden lanes up and down hill, and study the crazy tottering gables and odd pillared
doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy sea-folk. And he even talked
with the Terrible Old Man, who was not fond of strangers, and was invited into his fearsomely
archaic cottage where low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting
soliloquies in the dark small hours.
Of course it was inevitable that Olney should mark the grey unvisited cottage in the sky, on
that sinister northward crag which is one with the mists and the firmament. Always over
Kingsport it hung, and always its mystery sounded in whispers through Kingsport‘s crooked
alleys. The Terrible Old Man wheezed a tale that his father had told him, of lightning that shot
one night up from that peaked cottage to the clouds of higher heaven; and Granny Orne,
whose tiny gambrel-roofed abode in Ship Street is all covered with moss and ivy, croaked
over something her grandmother had heard at second-hand, about shapes that flapped out of
the eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that unreachable place—for the door
is set close to the edge of the crag toward the ocean, and glimpsed only from ships at sea.
At length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the Kingsporter‘s fear
nor the summer boarder‘s usual indolence, Olney made a very terrible resolve. Despite a
conservative training—or because of it, for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the
unknown—he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally
antique grey cottage in the sky. Very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be
tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic‘s
estuary. Probably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked their habitation, or
perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked out along
the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things,
and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling
southern slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet vertically from the water, so only the
western side, inland and toward Arkham, remained.
One early morning in August Olney set out to find a path to the inaccessible pinnacle. He
worked northwest along pleasant back roads, past Hooper‘s Pond and the old brick powder-
house to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the Miskatonic and give a lovely
vista of Arkham‘s white Georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow. Here he
found a shady road to Arkham, but no trail at all in the seaward direction he wished. Woods
and fields crowded up to the high bank of the river‘s mouth, and bore not a sign of man‘s
presence; not even a stone wall or a straying cow, but only the tall grass and giant trees and
tangles of briers that the first Indian might have seen. As he climbed slowly east, higher and
higher above the estuary on his left and nearer and nearer the sea, he found the way growing
in difficulty; till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed to reach the
world outside, and whether they came often to market in Arkham.
Then the trees thinned, and far below him on his right he saw the hills and antique roofs and
spires of Kingsport. Even Central Hill was a dwarf from this height, and he could just make out
the ancient graveyard by the Congregational Hospital, beneath which rumour said some
terrible caves or burrows lurked. Ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and
beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage. Now
the ridge narrowed, and Olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky. South of him the frightful
precipice above Kingsport, north of him the vertical drop of nearly a mile to the river‘s mouth.
Suddenly a great chasm opened before him, ten feet deep, so that he had to let himself down
by his hands and drop to a slanting floor, and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the
opposite wall. So this was the way the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and
sky!
When he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering, but he clearly saw the lofty
and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as grey as the rock, and high peak standing bold
against the milky white of the seaward vapours. And he perceived that there was no door on
this landward end, but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy bull‘s-eye panes
leaded in seventeenth-century fashion. All around him was cloud and chaos, and he could
see nothing below but the whiteness of illimitable space. He was alone in the sky with this
queer and very disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the wall
stood flush with the cliff‘s edge, so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save
from the empty aether, he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain. And it was
very odd that shingles so worm-eaten could survive, or bricks so crumbled still form a
standing chimney.
As the mist thickened, Olney crept around to the windows on the north and west and south
sides, trying them but finding them all locked. He was vaguely glad they were locked,
because the more he saw of that house the less he wished to get in. Then a sound halted
him. He heard a lock rattle and bolt shoot, and a long creaking follow as if a heavy door were
slowly and cautiously opened. This was on the oceanward side that he could not see, where
the narrow portal opened on blank space thousands of feet in the misty sky above the waves.
Then there was heavy, deliberate tramping in the cottage, and Olney heard the windows
opening, first on the north side opposite him, and then on the west just around the corner.
Next would come the south windows, under the great low eaves on the side where he stood;
and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable
house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other. When a fumbling came in the
nearer casements he crept around to the west again, flattening himself against the wall
beside the now opened windows. It was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not
come from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined. Steps sounded
again, and Olney edged round to the north; but before he could find a haven a voice called
softly, and he knew he must confront his host.
Stuck out of a west window was a great black-bearded face whose eyes shone
phosphorescently with the imprint of unheard-of sights. But the voice was gentle, and of a
quaint olden kind, so that Olney did not shudder when a brown hand reached out to help him
over the sill and into that low room of black oak wainscots and carved Tudor furnishings. The
man was clad in very ancient garments, and had about him an unplaceable nimbus of sea-
lore and dreams of tall galleons. Olney does not recall many of the wonders he told, or even
who he was; but says that he was strange and kindly, and filled with the magic of unfathomed
voids of time and space. The small room seemed green with a dim aqueous light, and Olney
saw that the far windows to the east were not open, but shut against the misty aether with dull
thick panes like the bottoms of old bottles.
That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder mysteries; and
from the tales of marvellous ancient things he related, it must be guessed that the village folk
were right in saying he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky
ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below. And the
day wore on, and still Olney listened to rumours of old times and far places, and heard how
the Kings of Atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean‘s
floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost
ships, who know by its sight that they are lost. Years of the Titans were recalled, but the host
grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the Elder
Ones were born, and when only the other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kla in
the stony desert near Ulthar, beyond the river Skai.
It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that ancient door of nail-studded
oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud. Olney started in fright, but the bearded
man motioned him to be still, and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small peep-
hole. What he saw he did not like, so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut
and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle beside his guest. Then Olney
saw lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a
queer black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his
host had not answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the great abyss, and the
seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the wrong ones.
Then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the table, and then bolder
ones in the dark panelled corners. And the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of
prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks. Frequently he would
glance at the door as if he expected someone, and at length his glance seemed answered by
a singular rapping which must have followed some very ancient and secret code. This time he
did not even glance through the peep-hole, but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt,
unlatching the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mist.
And then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room from the deep all the
dreams and memories of earth‘s sunken Mighty Ones. And golden flames played about
weedy locks, so that Olney was dazzled as he did them homage. Trident-bearing Neptune
was there, and sportive tritons and fantastic nereids, and upon dolphins‘ backs was balanced
a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the grey and awful form of primal Nodens, Lord of the
Great Abyss. And the conches of the tritons gave weird blasts, and the nereids made strange
sounds by striking on the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers in black sea-caves.
Then hoary Nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped Olney and his host into the
vast shell, whereat the conches and the gongs set up a wild and awesome clamour. And out
into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous train, the noise of whose shouting was lost in the
echoes of thunder.
All night in Kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and the mists gave them
glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the little dim windows went dark they
whispered of dread and disaster. And Olney‘s children and stout wife prayed to the bland
proper god of Baptists, and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and rubbers
unless the rain stopped by morning. Then dawn swam dripping and mist-wreathed out of the
sea, and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether. And at noon elfin horns rang over
the ocean as Olney, dry and light-footed, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport
with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he had dreamed in the sky-
perched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed
by other feet. Nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who
afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came
down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere under that
grey peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist, there lingered
still the lost spirit of him who was Thomas Olney.
And ever since that hour, through dull dragging years of greyness and weariness, the
philosopher has laboured and eaten and slept and done uncomplaining the suitable deeds of
a citizen. Not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer
like green reefs from a bottomless sea. The sameness of his days no longer gives him
sorrow, and well-disciplined thoughts have grown enough for his imagination. His good wife
waxes stouter and his children older and prosier and more useful, and he never fails to smile
correctly with pride when the occasion calls for it. In his glance there is not any restless light,
and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are
wandering. He has never seen Kingsport again, for his family disliked the funny old houses,
and complained that the drains were impossibly bad. They have a trim bungalow now at
Bristol Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the neighbours are urban and modern.
But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old Man admits a thing
untold by his grandfather. For now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the
high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous
brooding silence ever before the bane of Kingsport‘s maritime cotters. And old folk tell of
pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth‘s joys;
and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly. They say, too, that
the fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot, shining blue in the north with visions of frozen
worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against wild coruscations. And
the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled
seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys.
Worst of all, though, is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of Kingsport‘s young men, who
grow prone to listen at night to the north wind‘s faint distant sounds. They swear no harm or
pain can inhabit that high peaked cottage, for in the new voices gladness beats, and with
them the tinkle of laughter and music. What tales the sea-mists may bring to that haunted and
northernmost pinnacle they do not know, but they long to extract some hint of the wonders
that knock at the cliff-yawning door when clouds are thickest. And patriarchs dread lest some
day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky, and learn what centuried
secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof which is part of the rocks and the stars and the
ancient fears of Kingsport. That those venturesome youths will come back they do not doubt,
but they think a light may be gone from their eyes, and a will from their hearts. And they do
not wish quaint Kingsport with its climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the
years while voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that unknown and
terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to rest on their way from the sea to the
skies.
They do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant hearths and gambrel-
roofed taverns of old Kingsport, nor do they wish the laughter and song in that high rocky
place to grow louder. For as the voice which has come has brought fresh mists from the sea
and from the north fresh lights, so do they say that still other voices will bring more mists and
more lights, till perhaps the olden gods (whose existence they hint only in whispers for fear
the Congregational parson shall hear) may come out of the deep and from unknown Kadath
in the cold waste and make their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag so close to the gentle
hills and valleys of quiet simple fisherfolk. This they do not wish, for to plain people things not
of earth are unwelcome; and besides, the Terrible Old Man often recalls what Olney said
about a knock that the lone dweller feared, and a shape seen black and inquisitive against the
mist through those queer translucent windows of leaded bull‘s-eyes.
All these things, however, the Elder Ones only may decide; and meanwhile the morning mist
still comes up by that lonely vertiginous peak with the steep ancient house, that grey low-
eaved house where none is seen but where evening brings furtive lights while the north wind
tells of strange revels. White and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds,
full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And when tales fly thick in the grottoes
of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then
great eager vapours flock to heaven laden with lore; and Kingsport, nestling uneasy on its
lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock, sees oceanward only a mystic
whiteness, as if the cliff‘s rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled
free in the aether of faery.

The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath
(1927)
Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvellous city, and three times was he
snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it. All golden and lovely it
blazed in the sunset, with walls, temples, colonnades, and arched bridges of veined marble,
silver-basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and wide
streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in
gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked
gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles. It was a fever of the gods; a fanfare of
supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as clouds about a
fabulous unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood breathless and expectant on that
balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost-vanished
memory, the pain of lost things, and the maddening need to place again what once had an
awesome and momentous place.
He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in what cycle or
incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in waking, he could not tell. Vaguely it
called up glimpses of a far, forgotten first youth, when wonder and pleasure lay in all the
mystery of days, and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetick to the eager sound of lutes
and song; unclosing faery gates toward further and surprising marvels. But each night as he
stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over
that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence, he felt the bondage of dream‘s
tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot, or descend the wide marmoreal
flights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and
beckoning.
When for the third time he awaked with those flights still undescended and those hushed
sunset streets still untraversed, he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream
that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold waste where no man
treads. But the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting, nor did they give any
favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream, and invoked them sacrificially through the
bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not
far from the gates of the waking world. It seemed, however, that his prayers must have been
adversely heard, for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous
city; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights, and against
some hidden plan or wish of the gods.
At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among
ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind, Carter resolved to
go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before, and dare the icy deserts through the
dark to where unknown Kadath, veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars, holds
secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the Great Ones.
In light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this
design to the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah. And the priests shook their pshent-
bearing heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul. They pointed out that the Great
Ones had shewn already their wish, and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by
insistent pleas. They reminded him, too, that not only had no man ever been to unknown
Kadath, but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie; whether it be in the
dreamlands around our world, or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of
Fomalhaut or Aldebaran. If in our dreamland, it might conceivably be reached; but only three
fully human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs
to other dreamlands, and of that three two had come back quite mad. There were, in such
voyages, incalculable local dangers; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers
unmentionably outside the ordered universe, where no dreams reach; that last amorphous
blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity—the
boundless daemon-sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws
hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled, maddening
beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes; to which detestable
pounding and piping dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods, the
blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other Gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling
chaos Nyarlathotep.
Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of
flame, but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown Kadath in the cold waste, wherever
that might be, and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous
sunset city. He knew that his journey would be strange and long, and that the Great Ones
would be against it; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories
and devices to aid him. So asking a farewell blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on
his course, he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and
set out through the enchanted wood.
In the tunnels of that twisted wood, whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and
shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi, dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs;
who know many obscure secrets of the dream-world and a few of the waking world, since the
wood at two places touches the lands of men, though it would be disastrous to say where.
Certain unexplained rumours, events, and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs
have access, and it is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dream. But over the
nearer parts of the dream-world they pass freely, flitting small and brown and unseen and
bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love.
Most of them live in burrows, but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees; and although they
live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat, either physical or
spiritual, for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out. Carter,
however, had no fear; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and
made many a treaty with them; having found through their help the splendid city of Celephaïs
in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills, where reigns half the year the great King Kuranes,
a man he had known by another name in life. Kuranes was the one soul who had been to the
star-gulfs and returned free from madness.
Threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks, Carter made
fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs, and listened now and then for responses. He
remembered one particular village of the creatures near the centre of the wood, where a circle
of great mossy stones in what was once a clearing tells of older and more terrible dwellers
long forgotten, and toward this spot he hastened. He traced his way by the grotesque fungi,
which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings
danced and sacrificed. Finally the greater light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green
and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight. This was the
nearest of the great ring of stones, and Carter knew he was close to the zoog village.
Renewing his fluttering sound, he waited patiently; and was at length rewarded by an
impression of many eyes watching him. It was the zoogs, for one sees their weird eyes long
before one can discern their small, slippery brown outlines.
Out they swarmed, from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree, till the whole dim-litten region
was alive with them. Some of the wilder ones brushed Carter unpleasantly, and one even
nipped loathsomely at his ear; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders.
The Council of Sages, recognising the visitor, offered a gourd of fermented sap from a
haunted tree unlike the others, which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the
moon; and as Carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began. The zoogs did
not, unfortunately, know where the peak of Kadath lies, nor could they even say whether the
cold waste is in our dream-world or in another. Rumours of the Great Ones came equally from
all points; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks
than in valleys, since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and
the clouds beneath.
Then one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others; and said that in Ulthar,
beyond the river Skai, there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old Pnakotic
Manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of
dreams when the hairy cannibal Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olathoë and slew all
the heroes of the land of Lomar. Those manuscripts, he said, told much of the gods; and
besides, in Ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods, and even one old
priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight. He had failed,
though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly.
So Randolph Carter thanked the zoogs, who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd
of moon-tree wine to take with him, and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the
other side, where the rushing Skai flows down from the slopes of Lerion, and Hatheg and Nir
and Ulthar dot the plain. Behind him, furtive and unseen, crept several of the curious zoogs;
for they wished to learn what might befall him, and bear back the legend to their people. The
vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village, and he looked sharply for a
certain spot where they would thin somewhat, standing quite dead or dying among the
unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers. There
he would turn sharply aside, for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor;
and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide.
Remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks, and what it was possibly set up for, the
zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring; for they realise that all which
is forgotten need not necessarily be dead, and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly
and deliberately.
Carter detoured at the proper place, and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of
the more timid zoogs. He had known they would follow him, so he was not disturbed; for one
grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures. It was twilight when he came
to the edge of the wood, and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning.
Over fertile plains rolling down to the Skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys, and on
every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land. Once
he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water, and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the
inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind. At another house, where people
were stirring, he asked questions about the gods, and whether they danced often upon
Lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the Elder Sign and tell him the way to Nir
and Ulthar.
At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he had once visited and
which marked his farthest former travels in this direction; and soon afterward he came to the
great stone bridge across the Skai, into whose central pier the masons had sealed a living
human sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before. Once on the other side, the
frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs) revealed the near
neighbourhood of Ulthar; for in Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man
may kill a cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green cottages and
neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself, with its old peaked roofs
and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where
one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the cats
being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen zoogs, picked his way directly to the modest
Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and old records were said to be; and once within
that venerable circular tower of ivied stone—which crowns Ulthar‘s highest hill—he sought out
the patriarch Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kla in the stony desert and
had come down again alive.
Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple, was fully three
centuries old; but still very keen of mind and memory. From him Carter learned many things
about the gods, but mainly that they are indeed only earth‘s gods, ruling feebly our own
dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said, heed a man‘s
prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop
Kadath in the cold waste. It was lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of
ascending it would be very grave. Atal‘s companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn
screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kla. With unknown
Kadath, if ever found, matters would be much worse; for although earth‘s gods may
sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal, they are protected by the Other Gods from
Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. At least twice in the world‘s history the Other Gods
set their seal upon earth‘s primal granite; once in antediluvian times, as guessed from a
drawing in those parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts too ancient to be read, and once on
Hatheg-Kla when Barzai the Wise tried to see earth‘s gods dancing by moonlight. So, Atal
said, it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers.
Carter, though disappointed by Atal‘s discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found
in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan, did not wholly despair.
First he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed
terrace, thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods‘ aid; but Atal could tell him
nothing. Probably, Atal said, the place belonged to his especial dream-world and not to the
general land of vision that many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet. In that
case earth‘s gods could not guide him if they would. But this was not likely, since the stopping
of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the Great Ones wished to hide from
him.
Then Carter did a wicked thing, offering his guileless host so many draughts of the moon-wine
which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative. Robbed of his
reserve, poor Atal babbled freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported by
travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain Ngranek, on the isle of Oriab in the
Southern Sea, and hinting that it may be a likeness which earth‘s gods once wrought of their
own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain. And he
hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange, so that one might easily
recognise them, and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the gods.
Now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to Carter. It is known that
in disguise the younger among the Great Ones often espouse the daughters of men, so that
around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their
blood. This being so, the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on Ngranek
and mark the features; then, having noted them with care, to search for such features among
living men. Where they are plainest and thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and
whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands
Kadath.
Much of the Great Ones might be learnt in such regions, and those with their blood might
inherit little memories very useful to a seeker. They might not know their parentage, for the
gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces
wittingly; a thing which Carter realised even as he sought to scale Kadath. But they would
have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows, and would sing of far places and
gardens so unlike any known even in dreamland that common folk would call them fools; and
from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of Kadath, or gain hints of the marvellous
sunset city which the gods held secret. And more, one might in certain cases seize some well-
loved child of a god as hostage; or even capture some young god himself, disguised and
dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his bride.
Atal, however, did not know how to find Ngranek on its isle of Oriab; and recommended that
Carter follow the singing Skai under its bridges down to the Southern Sea; where no burgess
of Ulthar has ever been, but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of
mules and two-wheeled carts. There is a great city there, Dylath-Leen, but in Ulthar its
reputation is bad because of the black three-banked galleys that sail to it with rubies from no
clearly named shore. The traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are
human, or nearly so, but the rowers are never beheld; and it is not thought wholesome in
Ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers
cannot be exhibited.
By the time he had given this information Atal was very drowsy, and Carter laid him gently on
a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest. As he turned to
go, he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him, and wondered why the zoogs had
become so lax in their curious pursuit. Then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of Ulthar
licking their chops with unusual gusto, and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had
faintly heard in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest‘s conversation. He
recalled, too, the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded
a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside. And because he loved nothing on earth
more than small black kittens, he stooped and petted the sleek cats of Ulthar as they licked
their chops, and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no farther.
It was sunset now, so Carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the
lower town. And as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red
tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond, all mellow and magical in the
slanted light, he swore that Ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always, were not the
memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one on toward unknown perils. Then twilight
fell, and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic, and little yellow lights
floated up one by one from old lattice windows. And sweet bells pealed in the temple tower
above, and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the Skai. With the night
came song, and Carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed
balconies and tessellated courts of simple Ulthar. And there might have been sweetness even
in the voices of Ulthar‘s many cats, but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange
feasting. Some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and
which villagers say are on the moon‘s dark side, whither the cats leap from tall housetops, but
one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in Carter‘s lap to purr and play, and curled up
near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with
fragrant, drowsy herbs.
In the morning Carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for Dylath-Leen with the spun
wool of Ulthar and the cabbages of Ulthar‘s busy farms. And for six days they rode with
tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the Skai; stopping some nights at the inns of little
quaint fishing towns, and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of
boatmen‘s songs came from the placid river. The country was very beautiful, with green
hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills.
On the seventh day a blur of smoke arose on the horizon ahead, and then the tall black
towers of Dylath-Leen, which is built mostly of basalt. Dylath-Leen with its thin angular towers
looks in the distance like a bit of the Giants‘ Causeway, and its streets are dark and uninviting.
There are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves, and all the town is thronged
with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on
earth. Carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of Ngranek on the
isle of Oriab, and found that they knew of it well. Ships came from Baharna on that island, one
being due to return thither in only a month, and Ngranek is but two days‘ zebra-ride from that
port. But few had seen the stone face of the god, because it is on a very difficult side of
Ngranek, which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava. Once the gods were
angered with men on that side, and spoke of the matter to the Other Gods.
It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in Dylath-Leen‘s sea-taverns,
because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys. One of them was due in a
week with rubies from its unknown shore, and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock. The
mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide, and the way their turbans were
humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste. And their shoes
were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the Six Kingdoms. But worst of all was the matter
of the unseen rowers. Those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and
vigorously to be comfortable, and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the
merchants traded, yet to give no glimpse of its crew. It was not fair to the tavern-keepers of
Dylath-Leen, or to the grocers and butchers, either; for not a scrap of provisions was ever
sent aboard. The merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from Parg across the river.
That was all they ever took, those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers;
never anything from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and the fat black men of Parg
whom they bought by the pound. And the odours from those galleys which the south wind
blew in from the wharves are not to be described. Only by constantly smoking strong
thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them. Dylath-Leen
would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere, but
no mine in all earth‘s dreamland was known to produce their like.
Of these things Dylath-Leen‘s cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst Carter waited patiently
for the ship from Baharna, which might bear him to the isle whereon carven Ngranek towers
lofty and barren. Meanwhile he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any
tales they might have concerning Kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble
walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset. Of these things, however, he
learned nothing; though he once thought that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked
queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of. This man was reputed to trade with
the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng, which no healthy folk visit and
whose evil fires are seen at night from afar. He was even rumoured to have dealt with that
high-priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all
alone in a prehistoric stone monastery. That such a person might well have had nibbling
traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted,
but Carter soon found that it was no use questioning him.
Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt mole and the tall lighthouse,
silent and alien, and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town.
Uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront, and after a while the dark wide-
mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped stealthily ashore to seek the
bazaars of the jewellers. Carter observed them closely, and disliked them more the longer he
looked at them. Then he saw them drive the stout black men of Parg up the gangplank
grunting and sweating into that singular galley, and wondered in what lands—or if in any lands
at all—those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve.
And on the third evening of that galley‘s stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to
him, smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of Carter‘s quest. He
appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling; and though the sound of his voice
was unbearably hateful, Carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked.
He bade him therefore be his own guest in locked chambers above, and drew out the last of
the zoogs‘ moon-wine to loosen his tongue. The strange merchant drank heavily, but smirked
unchanged by the draught. Then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own, and
Carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby, grotesquely carved in patterns too
fabulous to be comprehended. He offered his wine to his host, and though Carter took only
the least sip, he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles. All the while
the guest had been smiling more and more broadly, and as Carter slipped into blankness the
last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter, and something quite
unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become
disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth.
Carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent-like awning on the deck
of a ship, with the marvellous coasts of the Southern Sea flying by in unnatural swiftness. He
was not chained, but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby, and the
sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered
up through the sinister hatches. He saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a
fellow-dreamer of earth—a lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport—had often discoursed in
the old days, and recognised the templed terraces of Zar, abode of forgotten dreams; the
spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of a thousand wonders where the eidolon Lathi
reigns; the charnal gardens of Xura, land of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of
crystal, meeting above in a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl, blessed
land of fancy.
Past all these gorgeous lands the malodorous ship flew unwholesomely, urged by the
abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before the day was done Carter saw
that the steersman could have no other goal than the Basalt Pillars of the West, beyond which
simple folk say splendid Cathuria lies, but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a
monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth‘s dreamland drop wholly to abysmal
nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the
awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon-sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily
in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods, blind,
voiceless, tenebrous, and mindless, with their soul and messenger Nyarlathotep.
Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent, though Carter
well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest. It is
understood in the land of dream that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men;
and all these agents, whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to work
the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and
messenger, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. So Carter inferred that the merchants of the
humped turbans, hearing of his daring search for the Great Ones in their castle on Kadath,
had decided to take him away and deliver him to Nyarlathothep for whatever nameless bounty
might be offered for such a prize. What might be the land of those merchants, in our known
universe or in the eldritch spaces outside, Carter could not guess; nor could he imagine at
what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their
reward. He knew, however, that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach
the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon Azathoth in the formless central void.
At the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily, and one
of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket
of plates. Then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat
that was passed around. But when they gave Carter a portion, he found something very
terrible in the size and shape of it; so that he turned even paler than before and cast that
portion into the sea when no eye was on him. And again he thought of those unseen rowers
beneath, and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was
derived.
It was dark when the galley passed betwixt the Basalt Pillars of the West and the sound of the
ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead. And the spray of that cataract rose to
obscure the stars, and the deck grew damp, and the vessel reeled in the surging current of
the brink. Then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken, and Carter felt the terrors
of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and comet-like into planetary
space. Never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder
all through the aether, leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass, and sometimes
feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity. These are the
nameless larvae of the Other Gods, and like them are blind and without mind, and possessed
of singular hungers and thirsts.
But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared, for he soon saw that the
helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon. The moon was a crescent, shining
larger and larger as they approached it, and shewing its singular craters and peaks
uncomfortably. The ship made for the edge, and it soon became clear that its destination was
that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from the earth, and which no
fully human person, save perhaps the dreamer Snireth-Ko, has ever beheld. The close aspect
of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to Carter, and he did not like the
size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there. The dead temples on the
mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no wholesome or suitable gods, and
in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to lurk some dark and inner meaning
which did not invite solution. And what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers
could have been, Carter steadily refused to conjecture.
When the ship rounded the edge, and sailed over those lands unseen by man, there
appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life, and Carter saw many low, broad, round
cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi. He noticed that these cottages had no windows,
and thought that their shape suggested the huts of Esquimaux. Then he glimpsed the oily
waves of a sluggish sea, and knew that the voyage was once more to be by water—or at
least through some liquid. The galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound, and the odd
elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to Carter. They now slid along at great
speed, once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form, but generally seeing nothing
but that curious sea and a sky that was black and star-strown even though the sun shone
scorchingly in it.
There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast, and Carter saw the
thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they leaned and bent, the manner in which
they were clustered, and the fact that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the
prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that
merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer, and the hideous stench of that
city grew stronger, he saw upon the jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he
recognised as akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap
the small brown zoogs ferment their peculiar wine.
Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead, and the better
he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them. For they were not men at all, or
even approximately men, but great greyish-white slippery things which could expand and
contract at will, and whose principal shape—though it often changed—was that of a sort of
toad without any eyes, but with a curiously vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end
of its blunt, vague snout. These objects were waddling busily about the wharves, moving
bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or off
some anchored galley with long oars in their fore paws. And now and then one would appear
driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed were approximate human beings with wide
mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath-Leen; only these herds, being without
turbans or shoes or clothing, did not seem so very human after all. Some of these slaves—the
fatter ones, whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally—were unloaded from ships
and nailed in crates which workers pushed into low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering
vans.
Once a van was hitched up and driven off, and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that
Carter gasped, even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place. Now and
then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven
aboard a galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toad-things as officers,
navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for
the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength, such as steering and
cooking, fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where
they traded. These creatures must have been convenient on earth, for they were truly not
unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned, and could haggle in the shops of
men without embarrassment or curious explanations. But most of them, unless lean and ill-
favoured, were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous
things. Occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated; some very like these semi-
humans, some not so similar, and some not similar at all. And he wondered if any of the poor
stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those
obnoxious drays.
When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toad-
things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of them seized Carter and dragged him ashore.
The smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling, and Carter held only scattered images of
the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without
windows. At length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in
pitch blackness. It was, apparently, all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark. The
odour of the place was intolerable, and when Carter was locked into a chamber and left alone
he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions. It was
circular, and about twenty feet across.
From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but Carter would not
touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but he felt that he was held for the coming
of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity‘s Other Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.
Finally, after an unguessed span of hours or days, the great stone door swung wide again and
Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets of that fearsome city. It
was night on the moon, and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches.
In a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the toad-things and twenty-four
almost-human torch-bearers, eleven on either side, and one each before and behind. Carter
was placed in the middle of the line; five toad-things ahead and five behind, and one almost-
human torch-bearer on each side of him. Certain of the toad-things produced disgustingly
carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds. To that hellish piping the column
advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi, soon commencing
to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city. That on some frightful
slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited, Carter could not doubt; and he
wished that the suspense might soon be over. The whining of those impious flutes was
shocking, and he would have given worlds for some even half-normal sound; but these toad-
things had no voices, and the slaves did not talk.
Then through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound. It rolled from the
higher hills, and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling
pandaemoniac chorus. It was the midnight yell of the cat, and Carter knew at last that the old
village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are
known only to cats, and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally, springing
from high housetops. Verily, it is to the moon‘s dark side that they go to leap and gambol on
the hills and converse with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of foetid things
Carter heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and
little lighted windows of home.
Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in this far, terrible place
he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he need not have done, for even as his lips
opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars
as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan had
been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of
smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The
flutes stopped, and there were shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans screamed, and cats
spit and yowled and roared, but the toad-things made never a sound as their stinking green
ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi.
It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had never before seen so
many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and mixed; common, Persian, and Manx;
Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over
them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the
temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the
pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain, where
myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a
divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave, but was soon overborne by
the surging waves of his loyal defenders. Then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the
clangour of war and the shouts of the victors, and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they
rushed to and fro over him in the fray.
At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was upon a
strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth, thirteen times greater than that of the
moon as we see it, had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across
all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in
orderly array. Circle on circle they reached, and two or three leaders out of the ranks were
licking his face and purring to him consolingly. Of the dead slaves and toad-things there were
not many signs, but Carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space
between him and the beginning of the solid circles of the warriors.
Carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats, and learned that his ancient
friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats
congregate. He had not been unmarked in Ulthar when he passed through, and the sleek old
cats had remembered how he petted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who
looked evilly at a small black kitten. And they recalled, too, how he had welcomed the very
little kitten who came to see him at the inn, and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in
the morning before he left. The grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army
now assembled, for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognised the
prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dream.
A yowl now came from a farther peak, and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation.
It was one of the army‘s outposts, stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one
foe which earth‘s cats fear; the very large and peculiar cats from Saturn, who for some reason
have not been oblivious of the charm of our moon‘s dark side. They are leagued by treaty with
the evil toad-things, and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a
meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter.
After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a closer formation, crowding
protectingly around Carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the
housetops of our earth and its dreamland. The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself
be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers, and told him
how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed. He also offered
to deposit him in any spot he desired, and Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence
the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab and the carven crest of
Ngranek, and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys, if
indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off. Then, upon a signal, the cats
all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst; while in a black cave on a
far unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos
Nyarlathotep.
The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded by his companions,
Carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder
in the abyss. Before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at
the inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, friendly cats were pouring out of the window in
streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave, and as Carter shook his paw he
said he would be able to get home by cockcrow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs
and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still nearly a
fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during that time he said what he could
against the black galleys and their infamous ways. Most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so
fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking
with the wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through such
traffick, it will not be his fault.
In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black mole and tall lighthouse, and Carter
was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men, with painted sides and yellow
lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes. Her cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriab‘s
inner groves, and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of Baharna, and the strange little
figures carved from Ngranek‘s ancient lava. For this they were paid in the wool of Ulthar and
the iridescent textiles of Hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in
Parg. Carter made arrangements with the captain to go to Baharna and was told that the
voyage would take ten days. And during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain
of Ngranek, and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon; but that most
travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lava-gatherers and image-
makers in Baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it. The
captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face, for the
wrong side of Ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister, and there are rumours of caves
near the peak wherein dwell the night-gaunts. But the captain did not wish to say just what a
night-gaunt might be like, since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams
of those who think too often of them. Then Carter asked that captain about unknown Kadath
in the cold waste, and the marvellous sunset city, but of these the good man could truly tell
nothing.
Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide turned, and saw the first
rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town. And for two days they
sailed eastward in sight of green coasts, and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that
climbed up steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves and
beaches where nets lay drying. But on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll
of the water was stronger, and soon passed from sight of any land. On the fifth day the sailors
were nervous, but the captain apologised for their fears, saying that the ship was about to
pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory, and that
when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that
simple folk disliked it. He admitted, moreover, that many ships had been lost in that part of the
sea; having been hailed when quite close to it, but never seen again.
That night the moon was very bright, and one could see a great way down in the water. There
was so little wind that the ship could not move much, and the ocean was very calm. Looking
over the rail Carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of a great temple, and in front of it an
avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square. Dolphins sported
merrily in and out of the ruins, and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there, sometimes
coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea. As the ship drifted on a little the floor
of the ocean rose in hills, and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and
the washed-down walls of myriad little houses.
Then the suburbs appeared, and finally a great lone building on a hill, of simpler architecture
than the other structures, and in much better repair. It was dark and low and covered four
sides of a square, with a tower at each corner, a paved court in the centre, and small curious
round windows all over it. Probably it was of basalt, though weeds draped the greater part;
and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or
monastery. Some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of
shining, and Carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears. Then by the watery
moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court, and saw that
something was tied to it. And when after getting a telescope from the captain‘s cabin he saw
that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of Oriab, head downward and without any
eyes, he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the
sea.
The next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for Zar, in the land of forgotten
dreams, with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo. And on the evening of the eleventh day
they came in sight of the isle of Oriab, with Ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the
distance. Oriab is a very great isle, and its port of Baharna a mighty city. The wharves of
Baharna are of porphyry, and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them, having streets
of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings. There
is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to
the inland lake of Yath, on whose farther shore are the vast clay-brick ruins of a primal city
whose name is not remembered. As the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin
beacons Thon and Thal gleamed a welcome, and in all the million windows of Baharna‘s
terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the
dusk, till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the
stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour.
The captain, after landing, made Carter a guest in his own small house on the shore of Yath
where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and his wife and servants brought strange
toothsome foods for the traveller‘s delight. And in the days after that Carter asked for rumours
and legends of Ngranek in all the taverns and public places where lava-gatherers and image-
makers meet, but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven
face. Ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it, and besides, one
could never depend on the certainty that night-gaunts are altogether fabulous.
When the captain sailed back to Dylath-Leen Carter took quarters in an ancient tavern
opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town, which is built of brick and
resembles the ruins of Yath‘s farther shore. Here he laid his plans for the ascent of Ngranek,
and correlated all that he had learned from the lava-gatherers about the roads thither. The
keeper of the tavern was a very old man, and had heard so many legends that he was a great
help. He even took Carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude
picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the olden days when men were
bolder and less reluctant to visit Ngranek‘s higher slopes. The old tavern-keeper‘s great-
grandfather had heard from his great-grandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture
had climbed Ngranek and seen the carven face, here drawing it for others to behold; but
Carter had very great doubts, since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and
careless, and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst
possible taste, with horns and wings and claws and curling tails.
At last, having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places
of Baharna, Carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by Yath‘s shore for
those inland parts wherein towers stony Ngranek. On his right were rolling hills and pleasant
orchards and neat little stone farmhouses, and he was much reminded of those fertile fields
that flank the Skai. By evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on Yath‘s farther
shore, and though old lava-gatherers had warned him not to camp there at night, he tethered
his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner
beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher. Around him he wrapped
another blanket, for the nights are cold in Oriab; and when upon awaking once he thought he
felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in
peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin groves.
The sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations
and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the
shore of Yath, and Carter looked about for his tethered zebra. Great was his dismay to see
that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied, and
still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead, with its blood all sucked
away through a singular wound in its throat. His pack had been disturbed, and several shiny
knick-knacks taken away, and all around on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for
which he could not in any way account. The legends and warnings of lava-gatherers occurred
to him and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night. Then he shouldered his pack
and strode on toward Ngranek, though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the
highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple, with
steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peer.
His course now led uphill through wilder and partly wooded country, and he saw only the huts
of charcoal-burners and the camps of those who gathered resin from the groves. The whole
air was fragrant with balsam, and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven
colours in the sun. Near sunset he came on a new camp of lava-gatherers returning with
laden sacks from Ngranek‘s lower slopes; and here he also camped, listening to the songs
and tales of the men, and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost.
He had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him, and at nightfall did not return to
his fellows. When they looked for him the next day they found only his turban, nor was there
any sign on the crags below that he had fallen. They did not search any more, because the
old men among them said it would be of no use. No one ever found what the night-gaunts
took, though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous. Carter
asked them if night-gaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints, but
they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry.
When he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more, but went to sleep in his
blanket.
The next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as they rode west and
he rode east on a zebra he had bought of them. Their older men gave him blessings and
warnings, and told him he had better not climb too high on Ngranek, but while he thanked
them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded. For still did he feel that he must find the gods on
unknown Kadath, and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset.
By noon, after a long uphill ride, he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hill-
people who had once dwelt thus close to Ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava.
Here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavern-keeper‘s grandfather, but about that time
they felt that their presence was disliked. Their homes had crept even up the mountain‘s
slope, and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose. At last
they decided it would be better to leave altogether, since things were sometimes glimpsed in
the darkness which no one could interpret favourably; so in the end all of them went down to
the sea and dwelt in Baharna, inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art
of image-making which to this day they carry on. It was from these children of the exiled hill-
people that Carter had heard the best tales about Ngranek when searching through
Baharna‘s ancient taverns.
All this time the great gaunt side of Ngranek was looming up higher and higher as Carter
approached it. There were sparse trees on the lower slope, and feeble shrubs above them,
and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky to mix with frost and ice and eternal
snow. Carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone, and did not welcome
the prospect of climbing it. In places there were solid streams of lava, and scoriac heaps that
littered slopes and ledges. Ninety aeons ago, before even the gods had danced upon its
pointed peak, that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner
thunders. Now it towered all silent and sinister, bearing on the hidden side that secret titan
image whereof rumour told. And there were caves in that mountain, which might be empty
and alone with elder darkness, or might—if legend spoke truly—hold horrors of a form not to
be surmised.
The ground sloped upward to the foot of Ngranek, thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash
trees, and strown with bits of rock, lava, and ancient cinder. There were the charred embers of
many camps, where the lava-gatherers were wont to stop, and several rude altars which they
had built either to propitiate the Great Ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in Ngranek‘s
high passes and labyrinthine caves. At evening Carter reached the farthermost pile of embers
and camped for the night, tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his
blanket before going to sleep. And all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the
shore of some hidden pool, but Carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror, since he had
been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slopes of Ngranek.
In the clear sunshine of morning Carter began the long ascent, taking his zebra as far as that
useful beast could go, but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin road became
too steep. Thereafter he scrambled up alone; first through the forest with its ruins of old
villages in overgrown clearings, and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew
here and there. He regretted coming clear of the trees, since the slope was very precipitous
and the whole thing rather dizzying. At length he began to discern all the countryside spread
out beneath him whenever he looked around; the deserted huts of the image-makers, the
groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them, the woods where
prismatic magahs nest and sing, and even a hint very far away of the shores of Yath and of
those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten. He found it best not to look around,
and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often
nothing but the tough grass to cling to.
Then the soil became meagre, with great patches of bare rock cropping out, and now and
then the nest of a condor in a crevice. Finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock, and
had it not been very rough and weathered, he could scarcely have ascended farther. Knobs,
ledges, and pinnacles, however, helped greatly; and it was cheering to see occasionally the
sign of some lava-gatherer scratched clumsily in the friable stone, and know that wholesome
human creatures had been there before him. After a certain height the presence of man was
further shewn by hand-holds and foot-holds hewn where they were needed, and by little
quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found. In one
place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right
of the main line of ascent. Once or twice Carter dared to look around, and was almost
stunned by the spread of landscape below. All the island betwixt him and the coast lay open
to his sight, with Baharna‘s stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the
distance. And beyond that the illimitable Southern Sea with all its curious secrets.
Thus far there had been much winding around the mountain, so that the farther and carven
side was still hidden. Carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to
head the way he wished, and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous.
After ten minutes he saw it was indeed no cul-de-sac, but that it led steeply on in an arc which
would, unless suddenly interrupted or deflected, bring him after a few hours‘ climbing to that
unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava. As
new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those
seaward lands he had traversed. The mountain‘s side, too, was somewhat different; being
here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left. Some
of these were above him and some beneath him, all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs
and wholly unreachable by the feet of man. The air was very cold now, but so hard was the
climbing that he did not mind it. Only the increasing rarity bothered him, and he thought that
perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd
tales of night-gaunts whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these
perilous paths. He was not much impressed by travellers‘ tales, but had a good curved
scimitar in case of any trouble. All lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face
which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown Kadath.
At last, in the fearsome iciness of upper space, he came round fully to the hidden side of
Ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which
marked the olden wrath of the Great Ones. There was unfolded, too, a vast expanse of
country to the south; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys, and
seemed to have no ending. No trace of the sea was visible on this side, for Oriab is a great
island. Black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs, but
none of them was accessible to a climber. There now loomed aloft a great beetling mass
which hampered the upward view, and Carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it
prove impassable. Poised in windy insecurity miles above earth, with only space and death on
one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other, he knew for a moment the fear that
makes men shun Ngranek‘s hidden side. He could not turn round, yet the sun was already
low. If there were no way aloft, the night would find him crouching there still, and the dawn
would not find him at all.
But there was a way, and he saw it in due season. Only a very expert dreamer could have
used those imperceptible foot-holds, yet to Carter they were sufficient. Surmounting now the
outward-hanging rock, he found the slope above much easier than that below, since a great
glacier‘s melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges. To the left a precipice
dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths, with a cave‘s dark mouth just out
of reach above him. Elsewhere, however, the mountain slanted back strongly, and even gave
him space to lean and rest.
He felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line, and looked up to see what glittering
pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight. Surely enough, there was the snow
uncounted thousands of feet above, and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just
climbed; hanging there forever in bold outline, black against the white of the frozen peak. And
when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud, and clutched at the jagged rock in
awe; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earth‘s dawn had shaped it, but gleamed red and
stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a god.
Stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire. How vast it was no mind can
ever measure, but Carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it. It was a god
chiselled by the hands of the gods, and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker.
Rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken, and Carter saw that it was indeed so;
for those long narrow eyes and long-lobed ears, and that thin nose and pointed chin, all spoke
of a race that is not of men but of gods. He clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie,
even though it was this which he had expected and come to find; for there is in a god‘s face
more of marvel than prediction can tell, and when that face is vaster than a great temple and
seen looking down at sunset in the cryptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it
was divinely hewn of old, the marvel is so strong that none may escape it.
Here, too, was the added marvel of recognition; for although he had planned to search all
dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the gods‘ children,
he now knew that he need not do so. Certainly, the great face carven on that mountain was of
no strange sort, but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport
Celephaïs which lies in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills and is ruled over by that King
Kuranes whom Carter once knew in waking life. Every year sailors with such a face came in
dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red
singing birds of Celephaïs, and it was clear that these could be no others than the half-gods
he sought. Where they dwelt, there must the cold waste lie close, and within it unknown
Kadath and its onyx castle for the Great Ones. So to Celephaïs he must go, far distant from
the isle of Oriab, and in such parts as would take him back to Dylath-Leen and up the Skai to
the bridge by Nir, and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs, whence the way would
bend northward through the garden lands by Oukranos to the gilded spires of Thran, where
he might find a galleon bound over the Cerenerian Sea.
But dusk was now thick, and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow.
Perched on that ledge night found the seeker; and in the blackness he might neither go down
nor go up, but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came, praying
to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags
and sharp rocks of the accursed valley. The stars came out, but save for them there was only
black nothingness in his eyes; nothingness leagued with death, against whose beckoning he
might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink. The last
thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward
precipice beside him, and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth
yawned just out of reach.
Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark, Carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily
out of his belt by some unseen hand. Then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below. And
between him and the Milky Way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something
noxiously thin and horned and tailed and bat-winged. Other things, too, had begun to blot out
patches of stars west of him, as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently
out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice. Then a sort of cold rubbery arm
seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he was lifted inconsiderately up and
swung about in space. Another minute and the stars were gone, and Carter knew that the
night-gaunts had got him.
They bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond.
When he struggled, as at first he did by instinct, they tickled him with deliberation. They made
no sound at all themselves, and even their membraneous wings were silent. They were
frightfully cold and damp and slippery, and their paws kneaded one detestably. Soon they
were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling, giddying,
sickening rush of dank, tomb-like air; and Carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate
vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness. He screamed again and again, but whenever he
did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety. Then he saw a sort of grey
phosphorescence about, and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of
subterrene horror of which dim legends tell, and which is litten only by the pale death-fire
wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earth‘s core.
At last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be
the fabled Peaks of Thok. Awful and sinister they stand in the haunted dusk of sunless and
eternal depths; higher than man may reckon, and guarding terrible valleys where the bholes
crawl and burrow nastily. But Carter preferred to look at them than at his captors, which were
indeed shocking and uncouth black beings with smooth, oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant
horns that curved inward toward each other, bat-wings whose beating made no sound, ugly
prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly. And worst of all,
they never spoke or laughed, and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with,
but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be. All they ever did was clutch and fly
and tickle; that was the way of night-gaunts.
As the band flew lower the Peaks of Thok rose grey and towering on all sides, and one saw
clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impassive granite of the endless twilight. At still
lower levels the death-fires in the air gave out, and one met only the primal blackness of the
void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblin-like. Soon the peaks were very far away,
and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them.
Then in the end the night-gaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of
bones, and left Carter all alone in that black valley. To bring him thither was the duty of the
night-gaunts that guard Ngranek; and this done, they flapped away silently. When Carter tried
to trace their flight he found he could not, since even the Peaks of Thok had faded out of
sight. There was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bones.
Now Carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of Pnath, where crawl and
burrow the enormous bholes; but he did not know what to expect, because no one has ever
seen a bhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like. Bholes are known only by dim
rumour, from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they
have when they wriggle past one. They cannot be seen because they creep only in the dark.
Carter did not wish to meet a bhole, so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths
of bones about him. Even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective, for whispers
of Pnath and its approaches were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the
old days. In brief, it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the
waking world cast the refuse of their feastings; and that if he but had good luck he might
stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than Thok‘s peaks which marks the edge of their
domain. Showers of bones would tell him where to look, and once found he could call to a
ghoul to let down a ladder; for strange to say, he had a very singular link with these terrible
creatures.
A man he had known in Boston—a painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an
ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard—had actually made friends with the ghouls
and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering.
This man had vanished at last, and Carter was not sure but that he might find him now, and
use for the first time in dreamland that far-away English of his dim waking life. In any case, he
felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of Pnath; and it would be better to meet a
ghoul, which one can see, than a bhole, which one cannot see.
So Carter walked in the dark, and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones
underfoot. Once he bumped into a stony slope, and knew it must be the base of one of Thok‘s
peaks. Then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air,
and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls. He was not sure he could be
heard from this valley miles below, but realised that the inner world has strange laws. As he
pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull, and
therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping
cry which is the call of the ghoul.
Sound travels slowly, so that it was some time before he heard an answering glibber. But it
came at last, and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered. The wait for
this was very tense, since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among
those bones by his shouting. Indeed, it was not long before he actually did hear a vague
rustling afar off. As this thoughtfully approached, he became more and more uncomfortable;
for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come. Finally the
tension grew almost unbearable, and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of
something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound. It was
the ladder, and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands. But the other sound did
not cease, and followed him even as he climbed. He had gone fully five feet from the ground
when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic, and was a good ten feet up when something
swayed the ladder from below. At a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt
his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave
with wriggling, and thereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of
that loathsome and overfed bhole whose form no man might see.
For hours he climbed with aching arms and blistered hands, seeing again the grey death-fire
and Thok‘s uncomfortable pinnacles. At last he discerned above him the projecting edge of
the great crag of the ghouls, whose vertical side he could not glimpse; and hours later he saw
a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of Notre Dame. This almost
made him lose his hold through faintness, but a moment later he was himself again; for his
vanished friend Richard Pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul, and he knew well their
canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies. So he had himself well
under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of
the crag, and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the
squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously.
He was now on a dim-litten plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and
the entrances of burrows. The ghouls were in general respectful, even if one did attempt to
pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively. Through patient glibbering he
made inquiries regarding his vanished friend, and found he had become a ghoul of some
prominence in abysses nearer the waking world. A greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct
him to Pickman‘s present habitation, so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature
into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould. They
emerged on a dim plain strown with singular relics of earth—old gravestones, broken urns,
and grotesque fragments of monuments—and Carter realised with some emotion that he was
probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven
hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the Gate of Deeper Slumber.
There, on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the Granary Burying Ground in Boston, sat the
ghoul which was once the artist Richard Upton Pickman. It was naked and rubbery, and had
acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure.
But it still remembered a little English, and was able to converse with Carter in grunts and
monosyllables, helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls. When it learned that
Carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city Celephaïs in Ooth-
Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills, it seemed rather doubtful; for these ghouls of the waking
world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland (leaving that to the web-footed
wamps that are spawned in dead cities), and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the
enchanted wood, including the terrible kingdom of the gugs.
The gugs, hairy and gigantic, once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange
sacrifices to the Other Gods and the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep, until one night an
abomination of theirs reached the ears of earth‘s gods and they were banished to caverns
below. Only a great trap-door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the earth-ghouls
with the enchanted wood, and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse. That a
mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable; for
mortal dreamers were their former food, and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such
dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts, those repulsive
beings which die in the light, and which live in the vaults of Zin and leap on long hind legs like
kangaroos.
So the ghoul that was Pickman advised Carter either to leave the abyss at Sarkomand, that
deserted city in the valley below Leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged
diorite lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs, or to return through a churchyard to
the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the
cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the
enchanted wood. This, however, did not suit the seeker; for he knew nothing of the way from
Leng to Ooth-Nargai, and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far
gained in this dream. It were disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of
those seamen from the north who traded onyx in Celephaïs, and who, being the sons of gods,
must point the way to the cold waste and Kadath where the Great Ones dwell.
After much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the
gugs‘ kingdom. There was one chance that Carter might be able to steal through that twilight
realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring
indoors, and reach the central tower with the sign of Koth upon it, which has the stairs leading
up to that stone trap-door in the enchanted wood. Pickman even consented to lend three
ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door; for of ghouls the gugs are
somewhat afraid, and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see
feasting there.
He also advised Carter to disguise as a ghoul himself; shaving the beard he had allowed to
grow (for ghouls have none), wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface, and
loping in the usual slumping way, with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice
morsel from a tomb. They would reach the city of the gugs—which is coterminous with the
whole kingdom—through the proper burrows, emerging in a cemetery not far from the stair-
containing Tower of Koth. They must beware, however, of a large cave near the cemetery; for
this is the mouth of the vaults of Zin, and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there
murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them. The ghasts
try to come out when the gugs sleep, and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs, for they
cannot discriminate. They are very primitive, and eat one another. The gugs have a sentry at
a narrow place in the vaults of Zin, but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a
party of ghasts. Though ghasts cannot live in real light, they can endure the grey twilight of
the abyss for hours.
So at length Carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the
slate gravestone of Col. Nehemiah Derby, obiit 1719, from the Charter Street Burying Ground
in Salem. When they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened
monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones
of the gugs. On the right of the hole out of which they wriggled, and seen through aisles of
monoliths, was a stupendous vista of Cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the
grey air of inner earth. This was the great city of the gugs, whose doorways are thirty feet
high. Ghouls come here often, for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year, and
even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men.
Carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of
Pnath.
Straight ahead, and just outside the cemetery, rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base
an immense and forbidding cavern yawned. This the ghouls told Carter to avoid as much as
possible, since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in
the darkness. And truly, that warning was soon well justified; for the moment a ghoul began to
creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs‘ resting had been rightly timed, there
glowed in the gloom of that great cavern‘s mouth first one pair of yellowish-red eyes and then
another, implying that the gugs were one sentry less, and that ghasts have indeed an
excellent sharpness of smell. So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his
companions to be silent. It was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices, and there was a
possibility that they might soon withdraw, since they must naturally be rather tired after coping
with a gug sentry in the black vaults. After a moment something about the size of a small
horse hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous
and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose, a
forehead, and other important particulars.
Presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow, and a ghoul glibbered softly at
Carter that their absence of battle-scars was a bad sign. It proved that they had not fought the
gug sentry at all, but merely slipped past him as he slept, so that their strength and savagery
were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim. It was
very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals, which soon numbered about
fifteen, grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers
and monoliths arose, but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in
the coughing gutturals of ghasts. And yet, horrible as they were, they were not so horrible as
what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness.
It was a paw, fully two feet and a half across, and equipped with formidable talons. After it
came another paw, and after that a great black-furred arm to which both of the paws were
attached by short forearms. Then two pink eyes shone, and the head of the awakened gug
sentry, large as a barrel, wobbled into view. The eyes jutted two inches from each side,
shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs. But the head was chiefly terrible
because of the mouth. That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom
of the head, opening vertically instead of horizontally.
But before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet,
the vindictive ghasts were upon him. Carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm
and arouse all his kin, till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice, but talk by means
of facial expression. The battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one. From all sides the
venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug, nipp
– Não tanto – disse Prior. – Não estamos buscando a

Gerald olhou para ela. – E nem vai conseguir. – Prendeu
os óculos sobre as orelhas e apertou
alguma coisa; uma luz veio por trás da lente direita. –
Mas há graus de aproximação. – A luz oscilou na direção
dela.– Está falando de cosmética, Gerald.
– Onde está Eddy? – perguntou ela, enquanto Gerald se
aproximava.
– No bar. Devo chamá-lo? – Prior pegou o fone, mas
colocou-o de volta sem usá-lo.
– O que é isto? – Afastando-se de Gerald.
– Um exame médico – disse Gerald. – Não vai doer. – Ele

Ela tomou algum estimulante – disse a Prior, num tom de
voz diferente.
– Tente não piscar, Mona. – A luz passou para o seu olho

– Wiz. – Desviando-se da luz.
Pegou-a pelo queixo com seus dedos frios e realinhou a
cabeça dela. – Quanto?
– Um cristal...
A luz se apagou. Sua face lisa estava muito próxima, os
óculos de proteção cheios de lentes e fendas, pequenas
cavidades de malha metálica negra. – Não há como
julgar a pureza – disse ele.
– É realmente pura – disse ela, e deu uma risadinha.Gerald soltou o queixo dela e sorriu. – Isso não será um
problema – disse ele. – Você poderia
abrir a boca, por favor?
– A boca?
– Quero ver seus dentes.
Ela olhou para Prior.
– Deu com sorte nesta – disse Gerald para Prior, quando
ligou a luz para olhar sua boca. –
Condições muito boas e próximas da configuração-alvo.
Amálgamas, obturações.
– Sabíamos que poderíamos contar com você, Gerald.
Gerald tirou os óculos e olhou para Prior. Voltou à valise
preta e guardou os óculos. – Teve sorte com os olhos,
também. Muito próximos. Basta mudar o matiz. – Tirou
um envelope metálico da
valise e abriu-o, colocando a luva cirúrgica na mão
direita. – Tire a toalha, Mona. Fique à vontade.
Ela olhou para Prior, para Gerald. – Vocês querem ver
meus papéis, os exames de sangue e todo
resto?
– Não – disse Gerald–, está tudo bem.
Ela olhou para a janela, esperando ver o carneiro, mas
ele tinha desaparecido e o céu parecia bem mais escuro.Tirou a toalha, deixando-a cair sobre o chão, depois se
deitou, virada para cima, na cama bege.
Não era muito diferente daquilo que ela fazia por
dinheiro; nem mesmo levava tanto tempo.
***
Sentada no banheiro com a frasqueira aberta sobre os
joelhos, esmagando outro cristal, decidiu
que tinha o direito de estar furiosa.
Primeiro, Eddy cai fora sem ela; depois, Prior aparece
com o médico esquisitão, então diz que
Eddy está dormindo em outro quarto. Lá na Flórida, ela
bem que poderia aproveitar um tempo sem
Eddy, mas ali era diferente. Não queria estar ali sozinha e
tinha ficado com medo de pedir uma chave para o Prior.
O sacana tinha uma, contudo, então podia entrar a
qualquer hora com seus amigos horripilantes. Que tipo
de acordo era aquele?
E o lance com a capa de chuva, de plástico, aquilo
também a deixava puta da vida. Uma merda de
uma capa de chuva de plástico descartável.
Amassou o pó de wiz entre as grades de nylon, socando-
o cuidadosamente no inalador, expirou
profundamente, colocou o bocal em seus lábios e
disparou. A nuvem de poeira amarela envolveu as
membranas de sua garganta; provavelmente deve ter
chegado um pouco até os pulmões. Tinha ouvido dizerque aquilo fazia mal.
Não tinha planejado nada quando foi ao banheiro tomar a
dose mas, assim que a parte de trás do
pescoço começou a formigar, ficou pensando sobre as
ruas ao redor do hotel, sobre o que tinha visto no
caminho até ali. Havia clubes, bares, lojas com roupas
nas vitrines. Música. Música seria ótimo agora, isso e
uma multidão. O jeito como é possível enlouquecer no
meio de uma multidão, esquecer-se de si mesmo, apenas
estar lá. A porta não estava trancada, ela sabia; já tinha
testado. Iria se trancar atrás dela, contudo, e não tinha
uma chave. Mas estava hospedada, então Prior
provavelmente tinha registrado seu nome na recepção.
Pensou em descer e pedir uma chave à mulher
do balcão, porém se sentia mal com a ideia. Conhecia
esse pessoal de uniforme atrás dos balcões, e o jeito que
têm de olhar as pessoas. Não, decidiu, a melhor coisa era
ficar no quarto e colocar, no stim, os novos da Angie.
Dez minutos depois, ela estava a caminho de uma porta
lateral distante do vestíbulo principal, o
wiz cantando em sua cabeça.
Estava chuviscando lá fora, talvez fosse condensação do
domo. Tinha vestido a capa branca para
ir até o vestíbulo, pensando que, no final das contas,
talvez Prior soubesse o que estava fazendo, e agora
estava feliz por estar com ela. Pegou umas folhas de fax
em uma lixeira e segurou sobre a cabeça para manter
seu cabelo seco. Não estava tão frio quanto antes, o que
era outra coisa boa.Nenhuma de suas roupas novas era o que alguém
chamaria de quentes.
Olhando para cima e para baixo na avenida, decidindo
qual caminho tomar, viu meia dúzia de
fachadas de hotel praticamente idênticas, uma fila de
tricitáxis, o brilho de pequenas lojas difuso pela chuva. E
pessoas, muitas delas, como no centro de Cleveland,
mas todos bem vestidos e todos se movendo como se
estivessem no controle de tudo, todos com algum lugar
para ir. Apenas siga o movimento, pensou, o wiz dando-
lhe uma segunda onda que a levou para a correnteza de
pessoas bonitas, sem ter que pensar sobre isso. Batendo
os calcanhares em seus sapatos novos, segurando o fax
sobre sua cabeça até que percebeu – mais sorte – que a
chuva havia parado.
Ela não teria se importado em dar uma olhadinha nas
vitrines, enquanto a multidão passava por
ela, mas o fluxo lhe dava prazer e ninguém mais estava
parando. Contentou-se com relances de cada vitrine. As
roupas eram como as roupas num stim, e algumas delas
tinham estilos que nunca havia visto antes.
Eu deveria ter estado aqui, pensou, deveria ter estado
aqui este tempo todo. Não numa criação de bagres, não
em Cleveland, não na Flórida. É um lugar, um lugar real,
qualquer um pode chegar aqui, você não tem que chegar
aqui por meio de um stim. O fato era que ela nunca tinha
visto esta parte em um stim, a parte das pessoas
comuns. Esta não era a parte de uma estrela como
Angie. Angie estaria longe, em castelos altos com outras
estrelas de stim, não aqui embaixo. Mas Deus, como era
bonito, a noite tão brilhante, a multidão se agitando aoredor dela, diante de todas as coisas boas que você teria
se, ao menos, tivesse sorte.
Eddy não gostava daquilo. De qualquer modo, ele
sempre dizia como era uma merda, muito movimentado,
aluguel muito alto, muita polícia, competição demais.
Não que ele tivesse hesitado sequer dois segundos
quando Prior fez a proposta, lembrou. E, de qualquer
maneira, ela tinha suas próprias ideias sobre por que
Eddy falava tão mal daquele lugar. Foi aqui que ele
estragou tudo, pensou, fez alguma merda bem grande,
deu uma de wilson. Ou ele não queria se lembrar disso
ou haveria pessoas que, certamente, o lembrariam se
voltasse. Estava presente no jeito irritado com que falava
daquele lugar, do mesmo jeito com que falaria de
qualquer um que dissesse que suas armações não
dariam certo. O novo colega, tão esperto na primeira
noite, era apenas um bobalhão na noite seguinte,
estúpido, sem visão.
Passando por uma grande loja exibindo um equipamento
de stim fantástico na vitrine, todo preto
e fino, apresentado por um maravilhoso holograma de
Angie, que observava todos os passantes com
seu sorriso meio triste. Rainha da noite, isso aí.
O rio de pessoas correu para um tipo de praça em
círculo, um lugar onde quatro ruas se encontravam e
rodeavam uma fonte. E porque Mona não estava
realmente indo para nenhum lugar específico, foi parar
lá, pois as pessoas ao seu redor se dispersaram em
direções diferentes, sem parar. Bem, havia pessoas no
círculo também, algumas delas sentadas no concreto
com rachaduras que margeava a fonte. Havia umaestátua no centro, mármore, desgastada e lisa. Era um
bebê montado num peixe, um golfinho. Parecia que a
boca do golfinho espirraria água se o chafariz estivesse
funcionando, mas não estava. Por sobre as cabeças das
pessoas sentadas, conseguia ver papel de fax enrugado
e encharcado e copos de isopor branco na água.
Depois pareceu que a multidão se fundiu atrás dela, uma
parede curvada de corpos em movimento e os três que
estavam à sua frente, à beira da fonte, saltaram como
uma gravura. Uma garota gorda com cabelo pintado de
preto, a boca entreaberta como se fosse sempre assim,
os seios saltando para fora de um corselete de borracha
vermelha; uma loira com um rosto comprido e um
traço azul fino de batom, a mão como a garra de um
pássaro segurando um cigarro; um homem com
braços recobertos de óleo expostos ao frio, músculos
enxertados protuberantes como rocha debaixo
de bronzeado sintético e tatuagens de prisão...
– Ei, sua vagabunda – gritou a garota gorda, meio que se
divertindo –, você não acha que vai
faturar unzinho neste pedaço, não é?
A loira olhou para Mona com seus olhos cansados e deu
um sorriso murcho para ela, um sorriso do tipo não-é-
culpa-minha, depois olhou para o outro lado.
O cafetão pulou do seu lugar como alguma coisa
impulsionada por molas, mas Mona já estava
se movendo, tendo entendido a expressão da loira. O
homem pegou-a pelo braço, mas a costura dacapa de chuva cedeu e ela se acotovelou de volta para
dentro da multidão. O wiz tomou o controle e a próxima
coisa de que se deu conta foi de que estava a cerca de
um quarteirão dali, apoiada em um
poste de metal, tossindo e hiperventilando.
Àquela altura, o wiz tinha virado do avesso, como fazia
às vezes, e tudo era horrível. Os rostos
na multidão pareciam tensos e famintos, como se todos
tivessem suas tarefas pessoais desesperadas para dar
conta e a luz das vitrines das lojas era fria e maligna, e
todas as coisas atrás do vidro estavam lá apenas para
dizer a ela que não poderia tê-las. Havia uma voz em
algum lugar, uma voz de criança brava juntando
obscenidades numa infindável corrente sem propósito;
quando se deu conta de quem era, parou com isso.
Seu braço esquerdo estava frio. Olhou para baixo e viu
que a manga tinha desaparecido, a costura lateral aberta
até a cintura. Tirou o casaco e enrolou-o sobre os ombros
como uma capa; talvez isso a tornasse mais difícil de
notar.
Apoiou suas costas contra o poste enquanto o wiz rolava
por cima dela numa onda de adrenalina
tardia; seus joelhos começaram a ceder e pensou que iria
desmaiar, mas então o wiz fez uma das suas e ela estava
agachada na luz do pôr do sol de verão no pátio do
velho, a terra cinzenta e arenosa riscada com as linhas
de um jogo que a tinha entretido, mas agora estava
apenas acocorada lá, largada, olhando para além dos
volumosos tanques, para onde vaga-lumes pulsavam
num arbusto deamoras sobre um velho chassis retorcido. Atrás dela
havia luz vinda da casa e podia sentir o cheiro do pão de
milho sendo assado e do café que ele fervia e
requentava várias vezes lá dentro, até que uma colher
pudesse se sustentar dentro dele, dizia ele, e ele estaria
lá lendo um de seus livros, folhas marrons quebradiças,
nunca uma página com um canto, ele os mantinha em
sacos de plástico esgarçados e, às vezes, se
transformavam em pó em suas mãos, mas se
encontrasse alguma coisa que
queria guardar, tirava uma copiadora de bolso da gaveta,
encaixava as pilhas e passava na página. Ela gostava de
ver as cópias saírem, novinhas, com seu cheiro especial
que sumia com o tempo, mas ele nunca a deixava usar a
copiadora. Às vezes ele lia em voz alta, uma certa
hesitação na voz, como alguém tentando tocar um
instrumento depois de um longo tempo sem praticar. Não
eram histórias o
que ele lia, não do tipo que tinha um final ou uma piada.
Eram como janelas para algo muito estranho; ele nunca
tentava explicar nada daquilo, provavelmente nem ele
entendia, talvez ninguém entendesse...
Então a rua voltou, dura e brilhante.
Ela esfregou os olhos e tossiu.

ANTÁRTICA COMEÇA AQUI
– Já estou pronta – disse Piper Hill, olhos fechados,
sentada no carpete numa vaga aproximaçãoda posição de lótus. – Toque a colcha com sua mão
esquerda. – Oito cabos finos saíam dos soquetes atrás
das orelhas de Piper, encaixando-se no instrumento que
estava atravessado sobre suas coxas bronzeadas.
Angie, enrolada num roupão branco, encarou a técnica
loira do canto da cama, a unidade de teste preta
cobrindo sua testa como uma venda erguida. Seguiu as
instruções, correndo as pontas dos dedos levemente
através da seda e do linho crus da colcha da cama.
– Bom – disse Piper, mais para ela mesma do que para
Angie, tocando alguma coisa no painel. –
De novo. – Angie sentiu o tecido engrossar sob seus
dedos.
– De novo. – Outro ajuste.
Podia distinguir as fibras individualmente agora, separar
a seda do linho...
– De novo.
Seus nervos gritavam enquanto as pontas esfoladas de
seus dedos arranhavam palha de aço, vidro moído...
– Ótimo – disse Piper, abrindo seus olhos azuis. Tirou um
frasquinho de marfim da manga de
seu quimono, retirou a rolha, passou o frasco para Angie.
Fechando os olhos, Angie aspirou cautelosamente. Nada.
– De novo.
Algo floral. Violetas?– De novo.
Sua cabeça foi inundada por um odor nauseante de
estufa.
– Olfato ok – disse Piper, enquanto o cheiro sufocante
desaparecia.
– Não notei. – Abriu os olhos. Piper estava oferecendo
para ela um pequeno disco de papel branco. – Contanto
que não seja peixe – disse Angie, lambendo a ponta do
dedo. Tocou o pedaço de
papel, ergueu o dedo em direção à língua. Um dos testes
de Piper tinha feito Angie ficar longe de frutos do mar por
um mês.
– Não é peixe – disse Piper, sorrindo. Mantinha o cabelo
curto, um capacete pequeno e conciso,
que acentuava o brilho do grafite dos soquetes inseridos
atrás de cada orelha. Joana D’Arc de silício, disse
Porphyre, e a verdadeira paixão de Piper parecia ser seu
trabalho. Era a técnica pessoal de Angie, reconhecida
como a melhor da Net.
Caramelo...
***
– Quem mais está aqui, Piper? – Tendo terminado o
Usher, Piper estava fechando seu
equipamento numa valise de nylon.
Angie tinha ouvido um helicóptero chegar uma hora
antes; havia ouvido risadas, passos no terraço, enquantoo sonho retrocedia. Tinha abandonado sua tentativa
usual de inventariar seu sonho
– se é que podia chamar aquilo de sono, as memórias
dos outros entrando, preenchendo-a, depois se esvaindo
para níveis que não podia alcançar, deixando essas
imagens residuais...
– Raebel – disse Piper –, Lomas, Hickman, Ng, Porphyre, o
Pope.
– Robin?
– Não.
***
– Continuidade – disse ela, no chuveiro.
– Bom dia, Angie.
– O toroide de Freeside. Quem é o dono?
– O toroide foi rebatizado de Mustique II pelos novos
donos, Julianna Group e Carribbana Orbital.
– Quem era o dono quando Tally gravou lá?
– Tessier-Ashpool S.A.
– Quero saber mais sobre a Tessier-Ashpool.
– Antártica começa aqui.
Ela olhou fixamente, através do vapor, para o círculo
branco do alto-falante. – O que você disse?– Antártica começa aqui é um videoanálise em duas
horas da família Tessier-Ashpool, dirigido por Hans
Becker, Angie.
– Você tem?
– Claro. David Pope acessou-o recentemente. Ficou
bastante impressionado.
– Mesmo? E quando foi isso?
– Na última segunda-feira.
– Vou assistir hoje à noite, então.
– Feito. Isso é tudo?
– Sim.
– Tchau, Angie.
David Pope. Seu diretor. Porphyre disse que Robin estava
contando às pessoas que ela ouvia vozes. Será que tinha
falado com o Pope? Tocou o painel de cerâmica, o jato
ficou mais quente. Por que Pope estava interessado na
Tessier-Ashpool? Tocou o painel novamente e ficou sem
fôlego debaixo de agulhas de uma água repentinamente
gelada.
De dentro para fora, de fora para dentro, as formas
daquela outra paisagem chegavam cedo, cedo demais...
***
Porphyre estava postado perto da janela quando ela
entrou na sala, um guerreiro masai numsarongue de couro e crepe de seda negros, com
enchimento nos ombros, e um sarongue de couro preto.
Os outros comemoraram quando a viram e Porphyre
virou-se, sorrindo.
– Pegou-nos de surpresa – disse Rick Raebel, espalhado
no sofá claro. Ele cuidava de efeitos e
edição. – Hilton achou que você iria querer mais tempo
de folga.
– Nos trouxeram de toda parte, querida – complementou
Kelly Hickman. – Eu estava em Bremen
e o Pope estava literalmente em órbita, em total modo
artístico, não é, David? – Ele olhou para o diretor,
buscando uma confirmação.
Pope, que estava sentado numa das cadeiras Luís xvi
virada de costas, seus braços cruzados no
topo frágil da cadeira, deu um sorriso cansado, o cabelo
escuro pendendo sobre seu rosto magro.
Quando a agenda de Angie permitia, Pope fazia
documentários para Net/Knowledge. Logo depois de
assinar com a Net, Angie participara anonimamente de
uma das peças de arte minimalistas de Pope,
um passeio interminável através de dunas de cetim rosa
e manchado, sob um céu de aço ornamentado.
Três meses depois, com sua carreira em plena ascensão,
uma versão pirata da fita tornou-se um clássico
underground.Karen Lomas, que fazia os retoques de Angie, sorriu da
cadeira à esquerda de Pope. À sua direita, Kelly Hickman,
figurino, sentada no chão claro ao lado de Brian Ng, o
contínuo e aprendiz de Piper.
– Bem – disse Angie –, estou de volta. Sinto muito ter
deixado todos esperando, mas era algo
que tinha de ser feito.
Houve um silêncio. Pequenos estalidos das cadeiras
douradas. Brian Ng tossiu.
– Estamos felizes por você estar de volta – disse Piper,
vindo da cozinha com uma xícara de café
em cada mão.
Comemoraram novamente, mais retraídos desta vez,
depois riram.
– Onde está Robin? – perguntou Angie.
– Mistah Lanier está em Londres. – disse Porphyre, as
mãos nos quadris envoltos em couro.
– Deve chegar dentro em pouco – disse Pope secamente,
levantando-se e aceitando um café de
Piper.
– O que você estava fazendo em órbita, David? –
perguntou Angie, pegando a outra xícara.
– Caçando solitários.
– Solidão?– Solitários. Eremitas.
– Angie – disse Hickman, intrometendo-se –, você precisa
ver a roupa de festa de cetim que Devicq mandou
semana passada! E tenho todos os modelos da coleção
de praia de Nakamura...
– Sim, Kelly, mas...
Pope, contudo, já tinha se virado para conversar com
Raebel.
– Ei! – disse Hickman, irradiando entusiasmo. – Vamos lá!
Vamos experimentar!
***
Pope passou a maior parte do dia com Piper, Karen
Lomas e Raebel, discutindo os resultados do
Usher e os intermináveis pormenores do que eles
chamavam de reinserção de Angie. Depois do almoço,
Brian Ng foi com ela ao exame físico, realizado numa
clínica particular, num prédio espelhado em Beverly
Boulevard.
Durante a espera, muito breve, na área de recepção
branca e cheia de plantas – certamente uma
espécie de ritual, como se uma consulta médica que não
envolvesse
espera
parecesse
incompleta,
sem
autenticidade – Angie se pegou questionando, como
tinha feito muitas vezes antes, por que o misterioso
legado de seu pai, os veves que tinha desenhado em sua
cabeça, nunca haviam sido detectados nesta ou em
qualquer outra clínica.Seu pai, Christopher Mitchell, tinha liderado o projeto
hibridoma, que havia conferido à Maas
Biolabs um verdadeiro monopólio na produção dos
primeiros biochips. Turner, o homem que havia
levado Angie para Nova York, tinha dado a ela uma
espécie de dossiê sobre seu pai, um biosoft
compilado por uma inteligência artificial de segurança da
Maas. Ela acessou o dossiê quatro vezes ao longo de
quatro ou cinco anos. Finalmente, numa noite de muita
bebedeira na Grécia, atirou-o no mar, da balaustrada do
iate de um industrial irlandês, após uma discussão com
Bobby. Não se lembrava mais do motivo da briga, mas se
lembrava muito bem da sensação mista de perda e de
alívio quando o pequeno pedaço de memória bateu na
água.
Talvez seu pai houvesse projetado seu trabalho artesanal
de modo que ficasse invisível às varreduras dos
neurotécnicos. Bobby tinha a sua própria teoria, uma que
ela suspeitava estar mais próxima da verdade. Talvez
Legba, o loa que Beauvior dizia ter um acesso
praticamente ilimitado à matrix do ciberespaço, pudesse
alterar o fluxo de dados enquanto era coletado pelos
scanners, tornando os veves transparentes... Legba
tinha, afinal, orquestrado sua estreia na indústria e a
ascensão subsequente que a levou a eclipsar a carreira
de quinze anos de Tally Isham como uma megaestrela da
Net.
Contudo, já fazia tanto tempo desde que o loa a tinha
cavalgado, e agora, Brigitte dissera, os veves tinham sido
redesenhados...– Hilton fez com que a Continuidade preparasse uma
matéria para você hoje –, disse-lhe Ng, enquanto ela
esperava.
– É?
– Sua declaração pública sobre a decisão de ir para a
Jamaica, enaltecendo os métodos da clínica, falando
sobre o perigo das drogas, seu entusiasmo renovado pelo
trabalho, gratidão pelos seus fãs, imagens de arquivo da
casa em Malibu...
A Continuidade era capaz de gerar imagens de vídeo de
Angie, animá-las com padrões
compilados a partir de seus stims. Assistir àquilo levava a
uma leve vertigem, não completamente desagradável,
uma das raras vezes em que ela foi capaz de
compreender diretamente a sua fama.
Uma campainha soou por trás das plantas.
***
Retornando da cidade, ela encontrou um bufê contratado
que estava preparando um churrasco no terraço.
Deitou-se no sofá, debaixo do Valmier, e ouviu o barulho
do mar. Da cozinha, podia escutar Piper explicando os
resultados do exame físico para Pope. Não havia
necessidade, na verdade – ela tinha recebido o atestado
de saúde mais limpo possível –, mas tanto Pope quanto
Piper gostavam de detalhes.
Quando Piper e Raebel colocaram agasalhos e saíram
para o terraço, onde permaneceramaquecendo as mãos sobre o carvão, Angie se encontrou
sozinha na sala, com o diretor.
– Você ia me contar, David, o que você estava fazendo lá
em cima, em órbita...
– Procurando por eremitas convictos. – Passou a mão
pelos cabelos ondulados. – Tem a ver com algo que eu
queria fazer ano passado, com comunidades voluntárias
na África. O problema foi
que, quando cheguei lá em cima, aprendi que qualquer
um que vai tão longe, que verdadeiramente vive sozinho
em órbita, em geral, quer permanecer assim.
– Você estava gravando, sozinho? Entrevistas?
– Não. Queria encontrar pessoas como aquelas e
convencê-las a gravar segmentos próprios.
– Conseguiu?
– Não. Ouvi algumas histórias, contudo. Histórias ótimas.
Um piloto de rebocador alega que havia crianças
selvagens vivendo numa fábrica de remédios japonesa
abandonada. Há todo um novo
conjunto de relatos apócrifos por lá, na verdade – navios
fantasmas, cidades perdidas... Há um pathos, uma
qualidade única nisso, pensando bem. Quero dizer, cada
pequeno pedaço está preso em órbita.
Tudo aquilo foi feito pelo homem, conhecido, apropriado,
mapeado. É como observar mitos se desenvolverem em
um estacionamento. Mas creio que as pessoas precisam
disso, não é?– Sim – disse ela, pensando em Legba, em Mamman
Brigitte, as mil velas...
– O que eu queria mesmo – disse ele – era ter conseguido
chegar a Lady Jane. Uma história tão
fantástica. Gótico puro.
– Lady Jane?
– Tessier-Ashpool. A família dela construiu o toroide de
Freeside. Pioneiros na alta órbita. A Continuidade tem um
vídeo maravilhoso... Dizem que ela matou o pai. É a
última da linhagem. O
dinheiro terminou anos atrás. Ela vendeu tudo, fez com
que cortassem o lugar onde morava da ponta do eixo do
fuso e o rebocassem para uma nova órbita.
Ela se sentou no sofá, os joelhos unidos, os dedos presos
ao redor deles. O suor corria por sobre suas costelas.
– Você não conhece a história?
– Não – respondeu.
– Isto é um fato interessante em si mesmo, porque
mostra o quão aptos eles eram em se manter
na obscuridade. Usavam seu dinheiro para ficar fora dos
noticiários. A mãe era Tessier, o pai Ashpool. Construíram
Freeside quando não havia nada similar. Ficaram
absurdamente ricos no processo. Provavelmente a
segunda maior fortuna, bem perto de Josef Virek, quando
Ashpool morreu. E, naturalmente, se tornaram
fantasticamente esquisitos neste meio-tempo, tendo
clonado seus filhos a torto e a direito...– Isso soa... terrível. E você tentou, de fato tentou
encontrá-la?
– Bem, fiz algumas investigações. A Continuidade
conseguiu para mim este vídeo de Becker, e
claro que sua órbita está registrada, mas não é bom
aparecer se você não foi convidado, não é? Então Hilton
me achou e me disse para voltar para cá, para o
trabalho... Você não está se sentindo bem?
– Sim, eu... acho que vou me trocar agora, colocar um
agasalho.
***
Depois que comeram, quando o café estava sendo
servido, ela pediu licença e disse boa-noite.
Porphyre seguiu-a até a base da escada. Tinha ficado
perto dela durante a refeição, como se percebesse sua
nova inquietação. Não, pensou ela, nada de novo; a
velha, a constante, a mesma que sempre foi. Todas as
coisas que a droga havia bloqueado.
– Se cuida, mocinha – disse, baixo demais para os outros
ouvirem.
– Estou bem – respondeu. – Gente demais. Ainda não
estou acostumada com isso.
Ele ficou quieto, olhando para ela, o brilho de brasas
morrendo por trás de seu crânio elegantemente
trabalhado e sutilmente inumano, até que ela se virou e
subiu as escadas.
Ouviu o helicóptero vir buscá-los uma hora mais tarde.– Casa – disse ela –, vou ver o vídeo da Continuidade
agora.
Enquanto o telão descia, abriu a porta do quarto e ficou,
por um momento, ao pé da escada, ouvindo os sons da
casa vazia. Barulho do mar, o zunido da máquina de
lavar louça, o vento batendo nas janelas que ficavam em
frente ao terraço.
Ela se virou para a tela e tremeu diante do rosto que viu
numa imagem congelada, uma tomada
granulada em close: sobrancelhas arqueadas sobre olhos
escuros, maçã do rosto alta e frágil e uma boca larga e
determinada. A imagem se expandiu continuamente,
para dentro da escuridão de um olho, tela negra, um
ponto branco, crescendo, se ampliando, tornando-se o
estreito fuso de Freeside.
Os créditos começaram a aparecer em alemão.
– Hans Becker – a casa começou, recitando a crítica
introdutória da biblioteca da Net –, um artista de vídeo
austríaco cuja marca registrada é uma obsessiva
interrogação de campos rigidamente delimitados de
informação visual. Suas abordagens vão da montagem
clássica a técnicas emprestadas da espionagem
industrial, imagens de espaço profundo e kino-
arqueologia. Antártica começa aqui, seu exame das
imagens da família Tessier-Ashpool, continua sendo o
ponto mais alto de sua carreira.
O clã de industriais patologicamente avessos à mídia,
operando da privacidade total de seu lar orbital, era um
desafio notável.O branco do fuso preencheu a tela enquanto o crédito
final sumia. Uma imagem foi deslocada
até o centro da tela, um instantâneo de uma jovem em
roupas escuras e largas, o plano de fundo indistinto.
MARIE-FRANCE TESSIER, MARROCOS.
Este não era o rosto na tomada de abertura, o rosto de
memória invasiva, ainda assim parecia
prometer isso, como se uma imagem larval se ocultasse
sob a superfície.
A trilha sonora tecia filamentos atonais, em meio a
camadas de estática e vozes indistintas, enquanto a
imagem de Marie-France era substituída por um retrato
monocromático de um jovem num colarinho engomado.
Tinha um rosto bonito, finamente proporcional, mas
muito duro em algum aspecto; em seus olhos, tédio
infinito. JOHN HARNESS ASHPOOL, OXFORD.
Sim, pensou ela, e encontrei você muitas vezes. Conheço
sua história, apesar de não me permitirem tocar nela.
Mas eu realmente acho que não gosto nem um
pouquinho de você, não é, mister Ashpool?

PASSARELA
A passarela vergou e oscilou. A maca era larga demais
para o corrimão da passagem; tiveram
que levantá-la à altura do peito enquanto avançavam
lentamente. Gentry ia na frente, suas mãos enfiadas emluvas segurando firme as braçadeiras de cada lado dos
pés do adormecido. Slick ficou
com a extremidade mais pesada, a cabeça, com as
baterias e todo o equipamento; podia sentir Cherry logo
atrás dele. Queria dizer para ela voltar, que era melhor
não sobrecarregar a passarela com o peso dela, mas não
conseguia.
Entregar a Gentry o pacote de drogas de Kid Afrika tinha
sido um erro. Não sabia o que havia
no derma que Gentry havia aplicado; não sabia o que já
estava fluindo pela corrente sanguínea de Gentry, para
começar. Seja lá o que fosse, Gentry tinha pirado
completamente e agora estavam ali, na porra da
passarela, vinte metros acima do chão de concreto da
Fábrica, e Slick estava prestes a chorar de frustração,
prestes a gritar; queria quebrar alguma coisa, qualquer
coisa, mas não podia soltar a maca.
E o sorriso do Gentry, iluminado pelo brilho do
bioindicador grudado no pé da maca, enquanto Gentry
dava outro passo para trás na passarela...
– Ei, cara – disse Cherry, com uma voz de garotinha –,
isto aqui é uma grande ideia de merda...
Gentry deu um puxão repentino e impaciente na maca e
Slick quase soltou o seu lado.
***
– Gentry – disse Slick – é melhor você pensar bem sobre
isso.Gentry havia tirado as luvas. Segurava um par de
conectores ópticos em cada mão e Slick podia
ver os encaixes do splitter vibrarem.
– Cara, Kid Afrika é barra-pesada, Gentry. Você não sabe
no que está se metendo, está se metendo no caminho
dele. – Aquilo não era estritamente verdade, já que Kid,
até onde Slick sabia, era esperto demais para valorizar a
vingança. Mas quem, diabos, sabia o que Gentry iria
fazer?
– Não estou me metendo com nada – disse Gentry, se
aproximando da maca com os conectores.
– Escuta, cara – disse Cherry –, se interromper o input
dele, talvez você o mate; o sistema nervoso autônomo
do cara vai pro espaço. Por que você não para isso? –
perguntou para Slick. – Por que não dá um chute no cara?
Slick esfregou os olhos. – Porque... não sei. Porque ele...
Olha, Gentry, ela está dizendo que isso pode até matar
esse pobre coitado, se você tentar se conectar. Está
ouvindo?
– “LF” – disse Gentry – foi o que ouvi. – Colocou os
conectores entre os dentes e começou a mexer em uma
das conexões na placa sem marcas, que ficava sobre a
cabeça do adormecido. Suas mãos tinham parado de
tremer.
– Merda – disse Cherry, se mordendo de nervoso. Gentry
pegou a conexão com a mão. Enfiou
um conector no lugar com a outra mão e começou a
apertar. Sorriu, olhando para o outro conector. –Ah, foda-se – disse Cherry – estou fora dessa – mas não
se moveu.
O homem na maca gemeu, uma vez, suavemente. O som
fez com que os pelos dos braços de Slick se eriçassem.
A segunda conexão se soltou. Gentry inseriu o outro
splitter e começou a firmar o encaixe.
Cherry foi rapidamente até o pé da maca, ajoelhou-se
para checar o indicador. – Ele sentiu isso
– disse ela, olhando para Gentry –, mas seus sinais
parecem ok...
Gentry virou-se para seus consoles. Slick observou
enquanto ele plugava os conectores no lugar. Talvez,
pensou, aquilo fosse funcionar; Gentry iria chapar logo e
teriam que deixar a maca lá em cima até que Little Bird e
Cherry o ajudassem a levá-la de volta pela passarela.
Gentry estava tão doidão que talvez ele devesse tentar
pegar as drogas de volta, algumas delas ao menos, ver
se as coisas voltavam ao normal...
– Só posso acreditar – disse Gentry – que isto estava
predeterminado. Prefigurado pela forma
do meu trabalho preliminar. Eu não seria tolo de achar
que entendo como isso ocorreu, mas não é nosso papel
questionarmos as razões, não é, Slick Henry? – Digitou
uma sequência num de seus teclados. – Alguma vez já
considerou a relação entre paranoia clínica e o fenômeno
da conversão religiosa?
– Do que ele está falando? – perguntou Cherry.Slick sacudiu a cabeça, de mau humor. Se dissesse
alguma coisa, só iria piorar a loucura de Gentry.
Gentry se dirigiu à enorme unidade de visualização, a
mesa de projeção. – Há mundos dentro dos mundos –
disse ele. – Macrocosmo, microcosmo. Esta noite,
carregamos um universo inteiro através de uma ponte e
o que está acima é como o que está abaixo... Era óbvio, é
claro, que tais coisas devessem existir, mas jamais ousei
ter qualquer esperança...
Deu uma olhada tímida para eles por sobre o ombro. – E
agora – disse ele –, veremos a forma
deste pequeno universo pelo qual nosso hóspede está
viajando. E nessa forma, Slick Henry, eu verei...
Ele apertou o botão de força no canto da mesa
holográfica. E gritou.

BRINQUEDOS
– Aqui está uma coisa adorável – disse Petal, tocando um
cubo de madeira do tamanho da cabeça
de Kumiko. – Batalha da Inglaterra. – Uma luz cintilava
sobre o objeto e, quando Kumiko se inclinou para a
frente, viu aquela pequena aeronave fazer um loop e
mergulhar, em câmera lenta, sobre uma
mancha acinzentada de Londres. – Eles as reconstituíram
a partir dos filmes de guerra – disse ele –, câmeras sobre
as metralhadoras. – Ela espiou e viu flashes,
praticamente microscópicos, do fogo antiaéreo do
estuário do Tâmisa. – Foi feito para o Centenário.Estavam na sala de bilhar de Swain, no térreo do número
16, nos fundos. Havia um fraco odor
de mofo, um eco de cheiro de pub. A arrumação e a
limpeza de toda a propriedade de Swain eram
temperadas, aqui, por uma requintada deterioração:
havia poltronas cobertas com couro arranhado,
peças de mobília pesada e escura, o verde opaco da
mesa de bilhar... As estantes de aço preto, cheias de
equipamento para entretenimento, tinham feito que Petal
a levasse até lá, antes do chá, em seus chinelos de pano
com as costuras aparecendo, para mostrar os brinquedos
disponíveis.
– Que guerra foi esta?
– A penúltima – disse ele, movendo-se para uma unidade
semelhante, porém maior, que
mostrava hologramas de duas garotas lutando boxe
tailandês. A sola calejada do pé de uma, contra a barriga
magra da outra, tensionada para levar o golpe. Ele tocou
um botão e a projeção sumiu.
Kumiko olhou novamente para a Batalha da Inglaterra e
seus mosquitos em chamas.
– Todos os tipos de arquivos de jogos – disse Petal,
abrindo uma valise de couro que guardava
centenas de gravações.
Mostrou meia dúzia de equipamentos; depois, coçou sua
cabeça lisa enquanto procurava por umcanal de notícias japonês. Encontrou-o, finalmente, mas
não pôde cortar a tradução automática do programa.
Assistiu com ela, enquanto um grupo de estagiários
executivos da Ono-Sendai escondia seus rostos numa
emotiva cerimônia de graduação. – Por que estão
fazendo isso? – perguntou ele.
– Estão demonstrando lealdade a seu zaibatsu.
– Certo – disse ele. Espanou a unidade de vídeo com um
espanador de penas. – É quase hora do
chá. – Saiu da sala. Kumiko desligou o áudio. Sally Shears
não tinha aparecido no café da manhã, nem Swain.
Cortinas verde-musgo escondiam outro conjunto de
janelas altas, que davam para o mesmo jardim. Olhou
para fora, para um relógio de sol coberto pela neve,
depois deixou a cortina fechar-se.
(O telão silencioso mostrava imagens de um acidente em
Tóquio, médicos com roupas metálicas serravam vítimas
apáticas de um amontoado de aço retorcido.) Um
armário vitoriano estava encostado na parede oposta,
com pés esculpidos que lembravam abacaxis. O buraco
da fechadura, enfeitado por marfim amarelado em forma
de diamante, estava vazio, e quando mexeu nas portas,
elas se abriram, exalando um odor químico de cera
antiga. Olhou fixamente para a mandala branca e preta
no fundo do armário até que ela se tornou o que era, um
alvo de dardos. A madeira lustrosa atrás dele estava
marcada e esburacada; alguns jogadores erravam
completamente o alvo, concluiu. A metade mais baixa do
armário tinha algumas gavetas, cada uma com um
pequeno puxador de bronzee um buraco de fechadura em miniatura ornado por
marfim. Ajoelhou-se em frente a eles, deu uma
espiada na direção da porta (o telão mostrando os lábios
de uma cantora de cabaré de Shinjuku) e abriu a gaveta
mais alta à direita, tão silenciosamente quanto possível.
Estava cheia de dardos, soltos ou em estojos de couro.
Fechou a gaveta e abriu outra à esquerda. Uma mariposa
morta e um parafuso enferrujado. Havia uma única
gaveta larga abaixo dessas duas primeiras; travou
quando tentou abri-la e fez um barulho. Olhou para trás
novamente (imagens de arquivo do logo da Fuji Electric
iluminando a baía de Tóquio), mas nenhum sinal de Petal.
Passou
vários
minutos
folheando
uma
revista
pornográfica, com texto em japonês, que parecia
ter a ver, sobretudo, com a arte dos nós. Debaixo disso
estava uma jaqueta empoeirada, feita de algodão preto
lustroso, assim como um estojo de plástico com a palavra
WALTER em alto-relevo ao
redor de sua tampa. A pistola era fria e pesada; Kumiko
podia ver seu rosto no metal azulado quando a ergueu de
seu suporte em espuma cortada sob medida. Nunca
havia segurado uma arma antes. A coronha de plástico
cinza parecia enorme. Colocou-a de volta no estojo e leu,
na diagonal, a seção japonesa de um folheto com
instruções em várias línguas. Era uma arma de ar
comprimido; bombeava-se a alavanca abaixo do cabo da
arma. Disparava bolinhas muito pequenas de chumbo.
Outro brinquedo. Recolocou os conteúdos na gaveta e
fechou-a.
As outras gavetas estavam vazias. Fechou a porta do
armário e voltou para a Batalha da Inglaterra.***
– Não – disse Petal –, desculpe, mas não dá.
Estava espalhando creme Devon num bolinho, a faca
pesada vitoriana como um brinquedo de criança em seus
dedos grossos. – Experimente o creme – disse ele,
abaixando sua enorme cabeça e
dirigindo-se a ela, candidamente, por sobre seus óculos.
Kumiko limpou um pouco de marmelada de seu lábio
superior com um guardanapo de linho. –
Você imagina que eu vá tentar fugir?
– Fugir? Está pensando nisso, em fugir? – Ele comeu o
bolinho, mastigou calmamente e deu uma olhada para o
jardim, onde neve fresca estava caindo.
– Não – disse ela. – Não tenho intenção de fugir.
– Bom – respondeu, dando outra mordida.
– Estou em perigo, na rua?
– Deus, não – disse ele, com uma espécie de jovialidade
intencional –, você está completamente
segura.
– Eu quero sair.
– Não.
– Mas saio com a Sally.
– Sim, ela é da pesada, sua Sally.– Não entendo essa expressão.
– Nada de sair sozinha. Está em nosso acordo com seu
pai, entende? Você está a salvo lá fora
com a Sally, mas ela não está aqui. Ninguém está
propenso a incomodar você de qualquer jeito, mas por
que arriscar? Eu mesmo ficaria muito feliz, entenda bem,
muito contente em levá-la para passear, só que estou
aqui de plantão, caso Swain receba visitas. Então, não
posso. É uma pena, realmente é. –
Parecia tão genuinamente triste que ela pensou em
desistir. – Quer mais uma torrada? – perguntou,
gesticulando em direção ao prato dela.
– Não, obrigada. – Largou o guardanapo. – Estava muito
bom – acrescentou.
– Da próxima vez você deveria experimentar o creme –
disse ele. – Impossível encontrá-lo depois da guerra. Veio
uma chuva da Alemanha e as vacas nunca mais foram as
mesmas.
– Swain está aqui agora, Petal?
– Não.
– Eu nunca o vejo.
– Tem estado por aí. Negócios. Funciona em ciclos. Logo
estarão todos aqui, e ele estará no comando de novo.
– Quem, Petal?
– Homens de negócios, como você diria.
– Kuromaku – disse ela.– Como?
– Nada – respondeu.
***
Ela passou a tarde sozinha na sala de bilhar, encolhida
numa poltrona de couro, vendo a neve cair sobre o
jardim e o relógio de sol tornar-se uma elevação branca
sem sinais distintivos. Imaginou sua mãe ali, envolta em
peles escuras, sozinha no jardim, enquanto a neve caía,
uma princesa-bailarina que se afogou na noite, nas
águas de Sumida.
Levantou-se, tremeu de frio, contornou a mesa de bilhar
até a lareira de mármore, onde a chama
de gás assobiava debaixo do carvão que nunca seria
consumido.

CAMINHO PRATEADO
Ela teve uma amiga em Cleveland, a Lanette, que lhe
ensinou muitas coisas. Como sair rápido de
um carro se um cliente tentasse trancar as portas, como
agir ao fazer uma compra. Lanette era um pouco mais
velha e usava sobretudo wiz, “para mudar a viagem”, já
que estava frequentemente viajando em várias coisas,
de análogos de endorfina até o velho ópio do Tennessee.
Quando não estava nas drogas, dizia que ficava sentada
doze horas num canto, em frente ao vídeo, assistindo
qualquer porcaria. Quando o wiz adicionava mobilidade à
invulnerabilidade calorosa de uma boa viagem, dizia ela,
você realmente entrava numas. Mas Mona tinhapercebido que as pessoas que estavam seriamente
viciadas passavam muito tempo vomitando e não podia
entender por que alguém
assistiria a um vídeo se havia um stim por perto. (Lanette
disse que simstim era só mais daquilo que ela queria
evitar.)
Pensou em Lanette porque ela lhe dava conselhos de vez
em quando – por exemplo, como virar
do avesso uma noite ruim. Esta noite, pensou, Lanette
lhe diria para procurar um bar e uma boa companhia.
Ainda tinha dinheiro da última noite de trabalho na
Flórida, então era uma questão de encontrar um lugar
que aceitasse dinheiro vivo.
Acertou de primeira. Um bom sinal. Descendo uma
escadaria estreita de concreto, para dentro
de um murmúrio esfumaçado de conversa e para o som
abafado de “White Diamonds”, de Shabu.
Não era um lugar frequentado por figurões, mas também
não era o que os cafetões de Cleveland chamavam de
“ponto”. Não estava nem um pouco interessada em ir
beber num ponto, não naquela noite.
Alguém se levantou do bar e saiu enquanto ela estava
entrando; Mona se apressou e pegou um
banco com o assento ainda quente, um segundo sinal.
O bartender deu um sorriso curto e acenou com a cabeça
quando ela lhe mostrou uma das notas,então pediu uma dose de bourbon e uma cerveja: era o
que Eddy sempre pedia quando ele mesmo pagava. Se
outra pessoa estivesse pagando, pedia coquetéis que o
bartender não saberia fazer, então passava um longo
tempo explicando exatamente como preparar a bebida.
Depois experimentava e reclamava que não estava tão
bom quanto os que faziam em L.A. ou em Cingapura ou
qualquer outro
lugar onde ela sabia que ele nunca havia estado.
O bourbon era estranho, um pouco amargo mas
realmente bom, depois de se acostumar com ele. Disse
isso ao bartender, que lhe perguntou onde costumava
beber. Respondeu Cleveland e ele assentiu. Aquilo era
álcool etílico ou alguma outra porcaria que supostamente
lembrava bourbon, ele disse. Quando disse a ele quanto
dinheiro ainda restava, ela sacou que o bourbon do
Sprawl era algo muito caro. Estava funcionando, contudo,
levando embora a sensação ruim, então ela bebeu o
resto e começou a tomar a cerveja.
Lanette gostava de bares mas nunca bebia, apenas
Coca-Cola ou algo assim. Mona sempre se lembrava de
um dia em que tomou dois cristais ao mesmo tempo, o
que Lanette chamava de dose de
duas pedras, e tinha ouvido uma voz dentro de sua
cabeça, bem nítida, como se alguém estivesse na sala:
Está se movendo tão rápido que está parado. E Lanette,
que tinha dissolvido uma pitada de Memphis negro, uma
hora antes, numa xícara de chá chinês, tomou meio
cristal e daí elas saíram para caminhar, fantasmas
vagando pelas ruas molhadas, juntas no que parecia,
para Mona, como umaharmonia perfeita, em que não era necessário falar. E
aquela voz estava certa, não havia tensão naquele fluxo
rápido, nenhum nervosismo trincado, apenas a sensação
de alguma coisa, talvez a própria Mona, se expandindo a
partir de um centro imóvel. Elas encontraram um parque,
jardins planos encharcados de poças prateadas, e
caminharam por todas as trilhas, e Mona tinha um nome
para esta memória: o Caminho Prateado.
E, pouco tempo depois disso, Lanette simplesmente
sumiu, ninguém mais a viu, e alguns diziam
que tinha ido para a Califórnia, alguns falavam no Japão e
outros diziam que ela teve uma overdose e foi jogada de
uma janela, o que Eddy chamava de mergulho seco, mas
não era o tipo de coisa em que Mona queria pensar,
então sentou-se bem ereta e olhou ao redor, e, sim,
aquele era um lugar legal, pequeno o suficiente para que
as pessoas ficassem meio amontoadas, mas era bom.
Era o que Eddy
chamava de um pessoal artístico, gente que tinha algum
dinheiro mas se vestia como se não tivesse, exceto que
as roupas se ajustavam perfeitamente e estava na cara
que eram novas.
Havia um vídeo atrás do bar, sobre as garrafas, e ela viu
Angie, olhando direto para a câmera e
dizendo alguma coisa, mas o som estava muito baixo
para se ouvir em meio ao barulho das pessoas.
Então apareceu uma cena filmada do alto, mostrando,
embaixo, uma série de casas em frente a uma
praia, daí Angie estava de volta, rindo e sacudindo os
cabelos e dando aquele sorriso meio triste para acâmera.
– Ei – disse ao bartender – é a Angie.
– Quem?
– Angie – disse Mona, apontando para a tela.
– É – respondeu – ela se meteu com alguma droga de
designer e decidiu sair fora; depois, foi
para a América do Sul, ou algum lugar desses, e pagou
alguns milhões para que a deixassem limpa.
– Ela não pode estar se drogando.
O barman olhou para ela. – Se você diz...
– Mas como ela poderia sequer começar a tomar algo?
Quero dizer, é a Angie, certo?
– Isso faz parte.
– Mas olhe pra ela – protestou –, é tão linda... – Mas Angie
desapareceu, substituída por um tenista negro.
– Você acha que aquela é ela? Aquilo é só uma cabeça
falante.
– Cabeça?
– Como uma marionete – disse uma voz atrás dela, e ela
virou-se o bastante para ver um tufo de
cabelo loiro e um grande sorriso branco. – Marionete – e
ergueu a mão, mexendo os dedos –, sabe?Sentiu o bartender largar a conversa, dirigindo-se para o
outro lado do bar. O sorriso branco se
expandiu. – Para ela não ter que fazer tudo aquilo
sozinha, sacou?
Ela retribuiu o sorriso. Bonitinho, olhos espertos e uma
aura secreta que era, justamente, o sinal que queria
receber. Não era um figurão, um cliente. Meio magrinho,
mas poderia ser bom naquela noite, e o jeito sorridente
de sua boca combinava de modo estranho com os olhos
espertos e brilhantes.
– Michael.
– Hã?
– Meu nome. Michael.
– Ah. Mona. Eu sou Mona.
– De onde você é, Mona?
– Flórida.
E Lanette não teria dito para ir fundo?
***
Eddy odiava o povo artístico: não compravam o que ele
tinha para vender. Teria odiado Michael
ainda mais, porque Michael tinha um emprego e um loft
num prédio comercial. Ou pelo menos ele
tinha dito que era um loft, mas quando chegaram lá era
menor do que Mona pensava que um loft deveria ser. O
prédio era velho, uma fábrica ou algo assim; algumas dasparedes eram de tijolos aparentes e o teto era forrado de
madeira. Mas o espaço todo havia sido dividido em
espaços como o de Michael, um quarto não muito maior
do que aquele do hotel, com uma área para dormir num
lado
e uma cozinha e um banheiro no outro. Isto ficava no
andar de cima, contudo, então o teto era basicamente
uma claraboia; talvez isto fizesse do lugar um loft. Havia
uma corrediça horizontal de papel vermelho cobrindo a
claraboia, presa a cordas e roldanas, como uma enorme
pipa. O lugar estava meio bagunçado, porém as coisas
espalhadas eram todas novas: algumas cadeiras de
metal brancas com assentos feitos de trama de plástico
claro, uma pilha de módulos de entretenimento, uma
estação de trabalho e um sofá de couro prateado.
Começaram no sofá, mas ela não gostou do jeito que sua
pele grudava nele, então se mudaram
para a cama, a que ficava na alcova.
Foi quando ela viu o equipamento de gravação para stim;
estava em prateleiras brancas na parede. Mas o wiz tinha
voltado e, de qualquer modo, se você decidiu entrar
nessa, vai até o fim. Ele a colocou no captador, uma
coleira de borracha preta com protuberâncias terminando
em trodos que
pressionavam a base de seu crânio. Sem fio; ela sabia
que aquilo era caro.
Enquanto ele estava instalando seu próprio set e
verificando o equipamento nas paredes, falou
sobre seu emprego, disse que trabalhava para uma
empresa em Memphis que criava nomes para novasempresas. Agora mesmo, ele estava tentando pensar
num nome para uma empresa chamada Cathode Cathay.
Os caras estão precisando mesmo de um novo nome,
disse ele, rindo, mas depois continuou e disse que não
era fácil. Porque já havia empresas demais e todos os
nomes bacanas já tinham sido usados. Ele tinha um
computador que sabia todos os nomes de todas as
empresas e um
outro que criava palavras que podiam ser usadas para
nomes, e um outro que verificava se as palavras
inventadas significavam “cuzão”, ou algo no gênero, em
chinês ou sueco. Mas a empresa para a qual trabalhava
não vendia apenas nomes, vendia o que ele chamou de
imagem, então ele tinha que trabalhar com um monte de
outras pessoas para saber se o nome criado combinava
com o resto
do pacote.
Deitou-se na cama com ela e não foi lá muito bom, como
se a diversão tivesse ido embora e ele
podia muito bem ser um cliente, do jeito que ela ficou
deitada lá pensando que ele estava gravando tudo para
ver de novo quando quisesse, e quantas outras já tinha
gravado?
A seguir, ela se deitou ao lado dele, depois, ouvindo o
cara respirar, até que o wiz começou a
girar em círculos pequenos na base de seu crânio,
passando a mesma sequência de imagens desconexas
repetidamente: a sacola de plástico que tinha usado para
guardar as suas coisas na Flórida, com seu arame torcido
para manter os insetos longe – o velho sentado na mesade compensado, descascando uma batata com uma faca
de açougueiro velha – um restaurante de frutos
do mar em Cleveland que tinha o formato de um
camarão ou algo semelhante, a couraça de suas costas
arqueadas feitas de metal laminado e plástico
transparente, pintada em rosa e laranja – o pregador que
tinha visto quando foi comprar roupas novas, ele e seu
Jesus fora de foco. Cada vez que o pregador retornava,
estava a ponto de dizer algo, mas nunca dizia. Ela sabia
que isso não pararia, a não ser que se levantasse e
fixasse a cabeça em outra coisa. Rastejou para fora da
cama e ficou olhando para Michael no brilho cinzento da
claraboia. O Final dos Tempos. O Final dos Tempos está se
aproximando…
Então se dirigiu à sala e colocou o vestido, porque estava
com frio. Sentou-se no sofá prateado.
A cortina vermelha transformou o cinza da claraboia em
rosa, conforme foi ficando mais claro lá fora. Imaginou
quanto custaria um lugar como aquele.
Agora que não podia vê-lo, era difícil se lembrar de como
se parecia. Bem, pensou, ele não terá problema algum
em se lembrar de mim, mas pensar nisso fez com que se
sentisse abatida ou machucada ou usada, como se
preferisse ter ficado no hotel com os stims da Angie.
A luz cinza e rosa estava preenchendo o lugar,
inundando, começando a tomar conta dos cantos.
Alguma coisa a fez lembrar Lanette e as histórias de que
ela tinha morrido de overdose. Às vezes, as pessoas
morriam de over na casa de alguém, e a maneira mais
fácil de lidar com isso era jogá-laspela janela, porque a polícia não conseguia saber de
onde tinham vindo.
Mas não ia pensar naquilo, então foi para a cozinha e
vasculhou a geladeira e os armários.
Havia um pacote de grãos de café no freezer, mas café
dá uma tremedeira junto com o wiz. Havia vários
pacotinhos laminados com rótulos japoneses, produtos
desidratados e congelados. Encontrou
um pacote de saquinhos de chá e tirou o lacre de uma
das garrafas de água da geladeira. Colocou um pouco
numa panela e remexeu o fogão até conseguir aquecê-la.
Os bocais eram círculos impressos
no balcão negro; era para colocar a panela no centro de
um círculo e tocar um ponto vermelho impresso ao lado.
Quando a água ficou quente, jogou um dos saquinhos de
chá dentro e tirou a panela do fogão.
Debruçou-se sobre a panela, aspirando o vapor com
aroma de ervas.
Nunca se esquecia de como Eddy era, quando ele não
estava por perto. Talvez não fosse grande
coisa, mas fosse como fosse, estava sempre por perto. É
preciso ter um rosto por perto que não mude. Mas pensar
em Eddy talvez não fosse uma boa ideia naquela hora.
Logo daria o estalo, a onda acabaria e antes disso teria
que pensar num jeito de voltar para o hotel e de repente
tudo parecia complicado demais, coisas demais para
fazer, fatos para acertar e aquilo era o estalo, quando
você tinha que começar a se preocupar em colocar o dia
em ordem de novo.Achou que Prior não iria deixar que Eddy batesse nela,
contudo, porque o que ele queria tinha
algo a ver com sua aparência. Virou-se para pegar uma
xícara.
Prior estava lá, usando um casaco preto. Ouviu a própria
garganta fazer um barulhinho estranho
e involuntário.
Já tinha visto muitas coisas antes, sob o efeito do wiz; se
olhasse direito para elas, simplesmente desapareciam.
Tentou fazer isso com Prior, mas não funcionou.
Ele ficou lá, parado, com uma espécie de arma de
plástico nas mãos, sem apontar para ela, apenas
segurando-a. Estava usando luvas como as que Gerald
tinha usado para examiná-la. Não parecia irritado;
porém, daquela vez, não estava sorrindo. E, por um bom
tempo, não disse coisa alguma, nem Mona falou.
– Quem está aqui? – Como quem pergunta ao chegar
