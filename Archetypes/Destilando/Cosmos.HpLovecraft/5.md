ing and tearing with their
muzzles, and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves. All the time they coughed
excitedly, screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one
of their number, so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city
had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the
cavern. As it was, the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness, with only
occasional evil echoes to mark its continuance.
Then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance, and Carter followed the
loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city
whose rounded towers of Cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight. Silently they
shambled over that rough rock pavement, hearing with disgust the abominable muffled
snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs. Apprehensive of
the ending of the rest hour, the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace; but even so the journey
was no brief one, for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale. At last, however,
they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest, above whose
colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in bas-relief which made one shudder
without knowing its meaning. This was the central tower with the sign of Koth, and those huge
stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading
to upper dreamland and the enchanted wood.
There now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness; made almost impossible
by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned for gugs, and were therefore nearly
a yard high. Of their number Carter could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn
out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him. All through the endless climb
there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to
the forest because of the Great Ones‘ curse, there are no such restraints concerning the
tower and the steps, and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top. So sharp are
the ears of gugs, that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the
city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants, accustomed from
their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin to seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and
slower quarry on those Cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect that the silent
pursuing gugs would not be heard at all, but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the
dark upon the climbers. Nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in
that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs. There was also some
peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, which frequently hopped up into the tower during
the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long, and the ghasts returned soon from their
deed in the cavern, the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome
and ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug.
Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness above; and matters
assumed a very grave and unexpected turn. It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more,
had strayed into that tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally
clear that this peril was very close. After a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed Carter
to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way, with the old slate tombstone
raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight. Ghouls can see in the
dark, so the party was not as badly off as Carter would have been alone. In another moment
the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast, and the slab-
bearing ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow. Presently two yellowish-red eyes
flashed into view, and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering. As it
hopped down to the step just above the ghouls, they wielded the ancient gravestone with
prodigious force, so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed
in a noxious heap. There seemed to be only this one animal, and after a moment of listening
the ghouls tapped Carter as a signal to proceed again. As before, they were obliged to aid
him; and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghast‘s uncouth remains
sprawled invisible in the blackness.
At last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt; and feeling above him, Carter realised
that the great stone trap-door was reached at last. To open so vast a thing completely was not
to be thought of, but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as
a prop, and permit Carter to escape through the crack. They themselves planned to descend
again and return through the city of the gugs, since their elusiveness was great, and they did
not know the way overland to spectral Sarkomand with its lion-guarded gate to the abyss.
Mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them, and
Carter helped push with as much strength as he had. They judged the edge next the top of
the staircase to be the right one, and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably
nourished muscles. After a few moments a crack of light appeared; and Carter, to whom that
task had been entrusted, slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture. There now
ensued a mighty heaving; but progress was very slow, and they had of course to return to
their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open.
Suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousandfold by a sound on the steps below
them. It was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghast‘s hooved body as it rolled down
to lower levels; but of all the possible causes of that body‘s dislodgment and rolling, none was
in the least reassuring. Therefore, knowing the ways of gugs, the ghouls set to with something
of a frenzy; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it
still whilst Carter turned the slab and left a generous opening. They now helped Carter
through, letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he
clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside. Another second and they were
through themselves, knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap-door while a
panting became audible beneath. Because of the Great Ones‘ curse no gug might ever
emerge from that portal, so with a deep relief and sense of repose Carter lay quietly on the
thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner
that ghouls rest.
Weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago, it was verily a
haven and a delight after the gulfs he had now left behind. There was no living denizen about,
for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear, and Carter at once consulted with his ghouls
about their future course. To return through the tower they no longer dared, and the waking
world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests Nasht and
Kaman-Thah in the cavern of flame. So at length they decided to return through Sarkomand
and its gate of the abyss, though of how to get there they knew nothing. Carter recalled that it
lies in the valley below Leng, and recalled likewise that he had seen in Dylath-Leen a sinister,
slant-eyed old merchant reputed to trade on Leng. Therefore he advised the ghouls to seek
out Dylath-Leen, crossing the fields to Nir and the Skai and following the river to its mouth.
This they at once resolved to do, and lost no time in loping off, since the thickening of the
dusk promised a full night ahead for travel. And Carter shook the paws of those repulsive
beasts, thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was
Pickman; but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left. For a ghoul is a ghoul, and
at best an unpleasant companion for man. After that Carter sought a forest pool and cleansed
himself of the mud of nether earth, thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully
carried.
It was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees, but because of the
phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day; wherefore Carter set out upon the well-
known route toward Celephaïs, in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills. And as he went he
thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an ash tree on Ngranek in far-away Oriab so
many aeons ago, and wondered if any lava-gatherer had fed and released it. And he
wondered, too, if he would ever return to Baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by
night in those ancient ruins by Yath‘s shore, and if the old tavern-keeper would remember
him. Such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamland.
But presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree. He had
avoided the great circle of stones, since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now; but it
appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session
elsewhere. Upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion;
and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern. For
a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs. It all came from the
loss of the party which had sneaked after Carter to Ulthar, and which the cats had justly
punished for unsuitable intentions. The matter had long rankled; and now, or within at least a
month, the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise
attacks, taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares, and giving not even the myriad cats
of Ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise. This was the plan of the zoogs, and Carter saw
that he must foil it before leaving on his mighty quest.
Very quietly therefore did Randolph Carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of
the cat over the starlit fields. And a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and
relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small, black, grey, tiger,
white, yellow, and mixed; and it echoed through Nir and beyond the Skai even into Ulthar, and
Ulthar‘s numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march. It was fortunate that the
moon was not up, so that all the cats were on earth. Swiftly and silently leaping, they sprang
from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge
of the wood. Carter was there to greet them, and the sight of shapely, wholesome cats was
indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss. He was
glad to see his venerable friend and one-time rescuer at the head of Ulthar‘s detachment, a
collar of rank around his sleek neck, and whiskers bristling at a martial angle. Better still, as a
sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the
very little kitten at the inn to whom Carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that long-
vanished morning in Ulthar. He was a strapping and promising cat now, and purred as he
shook hands with his friend. His grandfather said he was doing very well in the army, and that
he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaign.
Carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe, and was rewarded by deep-throated purrs of
gratitude from all sides. Consulting with the generals, he prepared a plan of instant action
which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of
zoogs; forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilisation of
their army of invasion. Thereupon without a moment‘s loss that great ocean of cats flooded
the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle. Flutterings
rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers, and there was very little resistance
among the furtive and curious brown zoogs. They saw that they were beaten in advance, and
turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present self-preservation.
Half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured zoogs in the
centre, leaving open a lane down which were marched the additional captives rounded up by
the other cats in other parts of the wood. Terms were discussed at length, Carter acting as
interpreter, and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of
rendering to the cats a large annual tribute of grouse, quail, and pheasants from the less
fabulous parts of their forest. Twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to
be kept in the Temple of the Cats at Ulthar, and the victors made it plain that any
disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by
consequences highly disastrous to zoogs. These matters disposed of, the assembled cats
broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes, which
they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glance.
The old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he
wished to reach, deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him
for the frustration of their warlike enterprise. This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only
for the safety it afforded, but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats. So in the
midst of a pleasant and playful regiment, relaxed after the successful performance of its duty,
Randolph Carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of
titan trees, talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band
indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of
the primeval floor. And the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold
waste, but did not know where it was. As for the marvellous sunset city, he had not even
heard of that, but would gladly relay to Carter anything he might later learn.
He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland, and
commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in Celephaïs, whither he was bound.
That old cat, already slightly known to Carter, was a dignified Maltese; and would prove highly
influential in any transaction. It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood,
and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell. The young sub-lieutenant he had met as a
small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it, but that austere
patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter set out alone
over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river, and the cats
went back into the wood.
Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the Cerenerian
Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing river Oukranos that marked his course. The sun
rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn, and heightened the colours of the thousand
flowers that starred each knoll and dingle. A blessed haze lies upon all this region, wherein is
held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold, and a little more of the summer‘s
humming music of birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place, and
feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember.
By noon Carter reached the jasper terraces of Kiran which slope down to the river‘s edge and
bear that temple of loveliness wherein the King of Ilek-Vad comes from his far realm on the
twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of Oukranos, who sang to
him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks. All of jasper is that temple, and covering
an acre of ground with its walls and courts, its seven pinnacled towers, and its inner shrine
where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night. Many
times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles,
but whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical priests, none but
the King of Ilek-Vad may say; for only he has entered the temple or seen the priests. Now, in
the drowsiness of day, that carven and delicate fane was silent, and Carter heard only the
murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under an
enchanted sun.
All that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of
gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods
carven from jasper or chrysoberyl. Sometimes he walked close to the bank of Oukranos and
whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream, and at other times he
paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side,
whose trees came down clear to the water‘s edge. In former dreams he had seen quaint
lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink, but now he could not glimpse any.
Once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird, which it lured to
the water by shewing its tempting scales in the sun, and grasped by the beak with its
enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon it.
Toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the
thousand gilded spires of Thran. Lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible
city, sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man
knows, for they are more ancient than memory. Yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates
and two hundred turrets, the clustered towers within, all white beneath their golden spires, are
loftier still; so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky, sometimes shining
clear, sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist, and sometimes clouded lower
down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours. And where Thran‘s gates
open on the river are great wharves of marble, with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and
calamander riding gently at anchor, and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales
with the hieroglyphs of far places. Landward beyond the walls lies the farm country, where
small white cottages dream between little hills, and narrow roads with many stone bridges
wind gracefully among streams and gardens.
Down through this verdant land Carter walked at evening, and saw twilight float up from the
river to the marvellous golden spires of Thran. And just at the hour of dusk he came to the
southern gate, and was stopped by a red-robed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond
belief, and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up Thran‘s steep mysterious streets and
linger in bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold. Then into that incredible
city he walked; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel, and thereafter amidst
curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers. Lights
shone through grated and balconied windows, and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid
from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled. Carter knew his way, and edged down
through darker streets to the river, where at an old sea-tavern he found the captains and
seamen he had known in myriad other dreams. There he bought his passage to Celephaïs on
a great green galleon, and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the
venerable cat of that inn, who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old
wars and forgotten gods.
In the morning Carter boarded the galleon bound for Celephaïs, and sat in the prow as the
ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the Cerenerian Sea began. For many leagues
the banks were much as they were above Thran, with now and then a curious temple rising
on the farther hills toward the right, and a drowsy village on the shore, with steep red roofs
and nets spread in the sun. Mindful of his search, Carter questioned all the mariners closely
about those whom they had met in the taverns of Celephaïs, asking the names and ways of
the strange men with long, narrow eyes, long-lobed ears, thin noses, and pointed chins who
came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little
red singing birds of Celephaïs. Of these men the sailors knew not much, save that they talked
but seldom and spread a kind of awe about them.
Their land, very far away, was called Inganok, and not many people cared to go thither
because it was a cold twilight land, and said to be close to unpleasant Leng; although high
impassable mountains towered on the side where Leng was thought to lie, so that none might
say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery
were really there, or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night
when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon. Certainly, men
reached Leng from very different oceans. Of other boundaries of Inganok those sailors had no
notion, nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown Kadath save from vague unplaced
report. And of the marvellous sunset city which Carter sought they knew nothing at all. So the
traveller asked no more of far things, but bided his time till he might talk with those strange
men from cold and twilight Inganok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on
Ngranek.
Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed
jungles of Kled. Here Carter wished he might disembark, for in those tropic tangles sleep
wondrous palaces of ivory, lone and unbroken, where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land
whose name is forgotten. Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places unharmed and
undecayed, for it is written that there may one day be need of them again; and elephant
caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight, though none dares approach them
closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due. But the ship swept on, and
dusk hushed the hum of the day, and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies
on the banks as that jungle fell far behind, leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had
been. And all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and
unsuspected. Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east, but the sleepy captain said
they had better not be looked at too much, since it was highly uncertain just who or what had
lit them.
In the morning the river had broadened out greatly, and Carter saw by the houses along the
banks that they were close to the vast trading city of Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the
walls are of rugged granite, and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered
gables. The men of Hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in
dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for barter, but is prized for the solid work of its
artisans. The wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain
traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets
where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the
bazaars. The sea-taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray
of high tides, and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and
casements of greenish bull‘s-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of
distant ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inganok, but had little to
add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then, at last, after much unloading and
loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea, and the high walls and gables of
Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any
that men had given them.
Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea, sighting no land and
speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead
the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slopes, and Carter knew
that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celephaïs. Swiftly
there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town, and the untarnished marble
walls with their bronze statues, and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then
rose the green gentle hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and
the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple ridge of the
Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and
toward other regions of dream.
The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the marble cloud-city of
Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky, and some of
which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland. Among these the
steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in
the dusk as the city‘s million lights began to twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed this
deathless city of vision, for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy. As it has always
been is still the turquoise of Nath-Horthath, and the eighty orchid-wreathed priests are the
same who builded it ten thousand years ago. Shining still is the bronze of the great gates, nor
are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken. And the great bronze statues on the walls look
down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable, yet without one grey hair in their
forked beards.
Carter did not at once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel, but stayed by the
seaward wall among traders and sailors. And when it was too late for rumours and legends he
sought out an ancient tavern he knew well, and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown
Kadath whom he sought. The next day he searched all along the quays for some of the
strange mariners of Inganok, but was told that none were now in port, their galley not being
due from the north for full two weeks. He found, however, one Thorabonian sailor who had
been to Inganok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place; and this sailor said
there was certainly a desert to the north of the peopled region, which everybody seemed to
fear and shun. The Thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of
impassable peaks into Leng‘s horrible plateau, and that this was why men feared it; though he
admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels. Whether or
not this could be the fabled waste wherein unknown Kadath stands he did not know; but it
seemed unlikely that those presences and sentinels, if indeed they truly existed, were
stationed for naught.
On the following day Carter walked up the Street of the Pillars to the turquoise temple and
talked with the high-priest. Though Nath-Horthath is chiefly worshipped in Celephaïs, all the
Great Ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers; and the priest was reasonably versed in their
moods. Like Atal in distant Ulthar, he strongly advised against any attempt to see them;
declaring that they are testy and capricious, and subject to strange protection from the
mindless Other Gods from Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos
Nyarlathotep. Their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did
not wish Carter to reach it, and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object
was to see them and plead before them. No man had ever found Kadath in the past, and it
might be just as well if none ever found it in the future. Such rumours as were told about that
onyx castle of the Great Ones were not by any means reassuring.
Having thanked the orchid-crowned high-priest, Carter left the temple and sought the bazaar
of the sheep-butchers, where the old chief of Celephaïs‘ cats dwelt sleek and contented. That
grey and dignified being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement, and extended a languid
paw as his caller approached. But when Carter repeated the passwords and introductions
furnished him by the old cat general of Ulthar, the furry patriarch became very cordial and
communicative; and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of
Ooth-Nargai. Best of all, he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront
cats of Celephaïs about the men of Inganok, on whose dark ships no cat will go.
It seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them, though that is not the reason
why no cat will sail on their ships. The reason for this is that Inganok holds shadows which no
cat can endure, so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely
mew. Whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical
Leng, or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north, none may say; but
it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like,
and to which they are more sensitive than men. Therefore they will not go on the dark ships
that seek the basalt quays of Inganok.
The old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend King Kuranes, who in Carter‘s
latter dreams had reigned alternately in the rose-crystal Palace of the Seventy Delights at
Celephaïs and in the turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating Serannian. It seems that he could no
more find content in those places, but had formed a mighty longing for the English cliffs and
downlands of his boyhood; where in little dreaming villages England‘s old songs hover at
evening behind lattice windows, and where grey church towers peep lovely through the
verdure of distant valleys. He could not go back to these things in the waking world because
his body was dead; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such
countryside in the region east of the city, where meadows roll gracefully up from the sea-cliffs
to the foot of the Tanarian Hills. There he dwelt in a grey Gothic manor-house of stone looking
on the sea, and tried to think it was ancient Trevor Towers, where he was born and where
thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light. And on the coast nearby he had
built a little Cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways, settling therein such people as
had the most English faces, and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of
old Cornwall fishers. And in a valley not far off he had reared a great Norman Abbey whose
tower he could see from his window, placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the
names of his ancestors carved thereon, and with a moss somewhat like Old England‘s moss.
For though Kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream, with all imagined pomps and
marvels, splendours and beauties, ecstacies and delights, novelties and excitements at his
command, he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and
freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet England, that ancient,
beloved England which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a
part.
So when Carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu, he did not seek the terraced palace
of rose-crystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked
gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the sea-cliffs. And in time he
came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge, and when he rang the bell there
hobbled to admit him no robed and anointed lackey of the palace, but a small stubbly old man
in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far Cornwall. And Carter walked
up the shady path between trees as near as possible to England‘s trees, and climbed the
terraces among gardens set out as in Queen Anne‘s time. At the door, flanked by stone cats in
the old way, he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery; and was presently taken to
the library where Kuranes, Lord of Ooth-Nargai and the Sky around Serannian, sat pensive in
a chair by the window looking on his little sea-coast village and wishing that his old nurse
would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawn-party at the
vicar‘s, with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patience.
Kuranes, clad in a dressing-gown of the sort favoured by London tailors in his youth, rose
eagerly to meet his guest; for the sight of an Anglo-Saxon from the waking world was very
dear to him, even if it was a Saxon from Boston, Massachusetts, instead of from Cornwall.
And for long they talked of old times, having much to say because both were old dreamers
and well versed in the wonders of incredible places. Kuranes, indeed, had been out beyond
the stars in the ultimate void, and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane
from such a voyage.
At length Carter brought up the subject of his quest, and asked of his host those questions he
had asked of so many others. Kuranes did not know where Kadath was, or the marvellous
sunset city; but he did know that the Great Ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out,
and that the Other Gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity. He
had learned much of the Other Gods in distant parts of space, especially in that region where
form does not exist, and coloured gases study the innermost secrets. The violet gas S‘ngac
had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep, and had warned him never to
approach the central void where the daemon-sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark.
Altogether, it was not well to meddle with the Elder Ones; and if they persistently denied all
access to the marvellous sunset city, it were better not to seek that city.
Kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even
were he to gain it. He himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely Celephaïs and
the land of Ooth-Nargai, and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of
its chains, conventions, and stupidities. But now that he was come into that city and that land,
and was the king thereof, he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out, and
monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories. He was a
king in Ooth-Nargai, but found no meaning therein, and drooped always for the old familiar
things of England that had shaped his youth. All his kingdom would he give for the sound of
Cornish church bells over the downs, and all the thousand minarets of Celephaïs for the steep
homely roofs of the village near his home. So he told his guest that the unknown sunset city
might not hold quite the content he sought, and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious
and half-remembered dream. For he had visited Carter often in the old waking days, and
knew well the lovely New England slopes that had given him birth.
At the last, he was very certain, the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes;
the glow of Beacon Hill at evening, the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint
Kingsport, the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and witch-haunted Arkham, and the blessed
miles of meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped
out from bowers of verdure. These things he told Randolph Carter, but still the seeker held to
his purpose. And in the end they parted each with his own conviction, and Carter went back
through the bronze gate into Celephaïs and down the Street of the Pillars to the old sea-wall,
where he talked more with the mariners of far parts and waited for the dark ship from cold and
twilight Inganok, whose strange-faced sailors and onyx-traders had in them the blood of the
Great Ones.
One starlight evening when the Pharos shone splendid over the harbour the longed-for ship
put in, and strange-faced sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the
ancient taverns along the sea-wall. It was very exciting to see again those living faces so like
the godlike features on Ngranek, but Carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen.
He did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those
children of the Great Ones, and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask
too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land. They talked little with the
other folk in those ancient sea-taverns; but would gather in groups in remote corners and sing
among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places, or chant long tales to one another in
accents alien to the rest of dreamland. And so rare and moving were those airs and tales, that
one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened, even though the words
came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody.
For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of
Celephaïs, and before they sailed Carter had taken passage on their dark ship, telling them
that he was an old onyx-miner and wishful to work in their quarries. That ship was very lovely
and cunningly wrought, being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold, and the
cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet. One morning at the turn of
the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lifted, and as Carter stood on the high stern he
saw the sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless Celephaïs
sink into the distance, and the snowy peak of Mount Aran grow smaller and smaller. By noon
there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the Cerenerian Sea, with one painted galley
afar off bound for that cloud-hung realm of Serannian where the sea meets the sky.
And night came with gorgeous stars, and the dark ship steered for Charles‘ Wain and the
Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole. And the sailors sang strange songs of
unknown places, and then stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers
murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers
beneath the sea. Carter went to sleep at midnight, and rose in the glow of a young morning,
marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont. And all through that second day
he made progress in knowing the men of the ship, getting them little by little to talk of their
cold twilight land, of their exquisite onyx city, and of their fear of the high and impassable
peaks beyond which Leng was said to be. They told him how sorry they were that no cats
would stay in the land of Inganok, and how they thought the hidden nearness of Leng was to
blame for it. Only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk. There was something
disquieting about that desert, and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence.
On later days they talked of the quarries in which Carter said he was going to work. There
were many of them, for all the city of Inganok was builded of onyx, whilst great polished
blocks of it were traded in Rinar, Ogrothan, and Celephaïs, and at home with the merchants
of Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron, for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports. And far to
the north, almost in that cold desert whose existence the men of Inganok did not care to
admit, there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest; from which had been hewn in
forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies
struck terror to all who beheld. Who had mined those incredible blocks, and whither they had
been transported, no man might say; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry, around
which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling. So it was left all alone in the twilight,
with only the raven and the rumoured shantak-bird to brood on its immensities. When Carter
heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought, for he knew from old tales that the Great
Ones‘ castle atop unknown Kadath is of onyx.
Each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky, and the mists overhead grew thicker
and thicker. And in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all, but only a weird grey twilight
shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day, and a cold starless phosphorescence from
the under side of that cloud by night. On the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was
sighted from afar, the first land glimpsed since Aran‘s snowy peak had dwindled behind the
ship. Carter asked the captain the name of that rock, but was told that it had no name and
had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night. And
when, after dark, a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place, the
traveller was glad that no stop had been made, and that the rock had no name. The seamen
prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot, and Carter dreamed terrible dreams
within dreams in the small hours.
Two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks
whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world. And at the sight of them
the sailors sang glad songs, and some knelt down on the deck to pray; so that Carter knew
they were come to the land of Inganok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the
great town bearing that land‘s name. Toward noon a dark coast-line appeared, and before
three o‘clock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the
onyx city. Rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays, all of delicate
black with scrolls, flutings, and arabesques of inlaid gold. Tall and many-windowed were the
houses, and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled
the eye with a beauty more poignant than light. Some ended in swelling domes that tapered
to a point, others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every
phase of strangeness and imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by frequent gates,
each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god
chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant Ngranek. On a hill in
the centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled
belfry resting on a flattened dome. This, the seamen said, was the Temple of the Elder Ones,
and was ruled by an old high-priest sad with inner secrets.
At intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city, answered each time by a
peal of mystic music made up of horns, viols, and chanting voices. And from a row of tripods
on a gallery round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments;
for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries, and faithful in keeping
the rhythms of the Great Ones as set forth in scrolls older than the Pnakotic Manuscripts. As
the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city
grew manifest, and Carter saw the slaves, sailors, and merchants on the docks. The sailors
and merchants were of the strange-faced race of the gods, but the slaves were squat, slant-
eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks
from valleys beyond Leng. The wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon
them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there, while at one end were great
piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of Rinar,
Ogrothan, and Celephaïs.
It was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone, and all the
sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city. The streets of that
city were paved with onyx, and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were
crooked and narrow. The houses near the water were lower than the rest, and bore above
their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective
small gods that favoured each. The captain of the ship took Carter to an old sea-tavern where
flocked the mariners of quaint countries, and promised that he would next day shew him the
wonders of the twilight city, and lead him to the taverns of the onyx-miners by the northern
wall. And evening fell, and little bronze lamps were lighted, and the sailors in that tavern sang
songs of remote places. But when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city, and
the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto, all ceased their
songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away. For there is a wonder and a
strangeness on the twilight city of Inganok, and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and
a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close.
Far in the shadows of that tavern Carter saw a squat form he did not like, for it was
unmistakably that of the old slant-eyed merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of
Dylath-Leen, who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of Leng which no
healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar, and even to have dealt with
that high-priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells
all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery. This man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of
knowing when Carter asked the traders of Dylath-Leen about the cold waste and Kadath; and
somehow his presence in dark and haunted Inganok, so close to the wonders of the north,
was not a reassuring thing. He slipped wholly out of sight before Carter could speak to him,
and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well
determined, bearing the colossal and rich-flavoured eggs of the rumoured shantak-bird to
trade for the dexterous jade goblets that merchants brought from Ilarnek.
On the following morning the ship-captain led Carter through the onyx streets of Inganok, dark
under their twilight sky. The inlaid doors and figured house-fronts, carven balconies and
crystal-paned oriels, all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness; and now and then a
plaza would open out with black pillars, colonnades, and the statues of curious beings both
human and fabulous. Some of the vistas down long and unbending streets, or through side
alleys and over bulbous domes, spires, and arabesqued roofs, were weird and beautiful
beyond words; and nothing was more splendid than the massive height of the great central
Temple of the Elder Ones with its sixteen carven sides, its flattened dome, and its lofty
pinnacled belfry, overtopping all else, and majestic whatever its foreground. And always to the
east, far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land, rose the gaunt grey sides of
those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous Leng was said to lie.
The captain took Carter to the mighty temple, which is set with its walled garden in a great
round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheel‘s hub. The seven arched gates of
that garden, each having over it a carven face like those on the city‘s gates, are always open;
and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined
with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods. And there are fountains, pools, and
basins there to reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony, all of onyx and
having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean. When the
deep clang from the temple‘s belfry shivers over the garden and the city, and the answer of
the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates, there
issue from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded priests in
black, bearing at arm‘s length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam
rises. And all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file, legs thrown far forward without
bending the knees, down the walks that lead to the seven lodges, wherein they disappear and
do not appear again. It is said that subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple, and
that the long files of priests return through them; nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx
steps go down to mysteries that are never told. But only a few are those who hint that the
priests in the masked and hooded columns are not human priests.
Carter did not enter the temple, because none but the Veiled King is permitted to do that. But
before he left the garden the hour of the bell came, and he heard the shivering clang
deafeningly above him, and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges
by the gates. And down the seven great walks stalked the long files of bowl-bearing priests in
their singular way, giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give. When
the last of them had vanished he left that garden, noting as he did so a spot on the pavement
over which the bowls had passed. Even the ship-captain did not like that spot, and hurried
him on toward the hill whereon the Veiled King‘s palace rises many-domed and marvellous.
The ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow, all but that broad curving one where the
king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak-drawn chariots. Carter and his guide climbed
up an alley that was all steps, between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold, and under
balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic
fragrance. Always ahead loomed those titan walls, mighty buttresses, and clustered and
bulbous domes for which the Veiled King‘s palace is famous; and at length they passed under
a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch‘s pleasure. There Carter
paused in faintness at so much of beauty; for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks, the
gay parterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices, the brazen urns and
tripods with cunning bas-reliefs, the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black
marble, the basalt-bottomed lagoons and tiled fountains with luminous fish, the tiny temples of
iridescent singing birds atop carven columns, the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze
gates, and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to
form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality, and half-fabulous even in the land of
dream. There it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky, with the domed and
fretted magnificence of the palace ahead, and the fantastic silhouette of the distant
impassable peaks on the right. And ever the small birds and the fountains sang, while the
perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden. No other human
presence was there, and Carter was glad it was so. Then they turned and descended again
the onyx alley of steps, for the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it is not well to look too
long and steadily at the great central dome, since it is said to house the archaic father of all
the rumoured shantak-birds, and to send out queer dreams to the curious.
After that the captain took Carter to the north quarter of the town, near the Gate of the
Caravans, where are the taverns of the yak-merchants and the onyx-miners. And there, in a
low-ceiled inn of quarrymen, they said farewell; for business called the captain whilst Carter
was eager to talk with miners about the north. There were many men in that inn, and the
traveller was not long in speaking to some of them; saying that he was an old miner of onyx,
and anxious to know somewhat of Inganok‘s quarries. But all that he learnt was not much
more than he knew before, for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the
north and the quarry that no man visits. They had fears of fabled emissaries from around the
mountains where Leng is said to lie, and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north
among the scattered rocks. And they whispered also that the rumoured shantak-birds are no
wholesome things; it being indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one (for that
fabled father of shantaks in the king‘s dome is fed in the dark).
The next day, saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit
the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of Inganok, Carter hired a yak and stuffed great
leathern saddle-bags for a journey. Beyond the Gate of the Caravans the road lay straight
betwixt tilled fields, with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes. At some of these
houses the seeker stopped to ask questions; once finding a host so austere and reticent, and
so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on Ngranek, that he felt certain
he had come at last upon one of the Great Ones themselves, or upon one with full nine-tenths
of their blood, dwelling amongst men. And to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to
speak very well of the gods, and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded him.
That night Carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath-tree to which he tied
his yak, and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage. At about ten o‘clock he
reached the small-domed village of Urg, where traders rest and miners tell their tales, and
paused in its taverns till noon. It is here that the great caravan road turns west toward Selarn,
but Carter kept on north by the quarry road. All the afternoon he followed that rising road,
which was somewhat narrower than the great highway, and which now led through a region
with more rocks than tilled fields. And by evening the low hills on his left had risen into
sizeable black cliffs, so that he knew he was close to the mining country. All the while the
great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right, and the farther he
went, the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of
lumbering onyx-carts along the way.
On the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag, tethering his yak to a
stake driven in the ground. He observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at this
northerly point, and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them. And
on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry, and greeted the men who there
laboured with picks and chisels. Before evening he had passed eleven quarries; the land
being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders, with no vegetation at all, but only
great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth, with the grey impassable peaks
always rising gaunt and sinister on his right. The third night he spent in a camp of quarry men
whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west. And they sang
many songs and told many tales, shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the
habits of gods that Carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the Great
Ones. They asked him whither he went, and cautioned him not to go too far to the north; but
he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx, and would take no more risks than were
common among prospectors. In the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the
darkening north, where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry
whence hands older than men‘s hands had wrenched prodigious blocks. But he did not like it
when, turning back to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw approaching the camp that
squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes, whose conjectured traffick with Leng was
the gossip of distant Dylath-Leen.
After two more quarries the inhabited part of Inganok seemed to end, and the road narrowed
to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black cliffs. Always on the right towered the
gaunt and distant peaks, and as Carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm
he found it grew darker and colder. Soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or
hooves on the black path beneath, and realised that he was indeed come into strange and
deserted ways of elder time. Once in a while a raven would croak far overhead, and now and
then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured
shantak-bird. But in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed, and it troubled him to
observe that this excellent yak become more and more reluctant to advance, and more and
more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the route.
The path now contracted between sable and glistening walls, and began to display an even
greater steepness than before. It was a bad footing, and the yak often slipped on the stony
fragments strown thickly about. In two hours Carter saw ahead a definite crest, beyond which
was nothing but dull grey sky, and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course. To
reach this crest, however, was no easy task; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular, and
was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones. Eventually Carter dismounted and led
his dubious yak; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled, and keeping his own
footing as best he might. Then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond, and gasped at
what he saw.
The path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down, with the same lines of high natural
walls as before; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space, vast acres in
extent, where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a
giants‘ quarry. Far back into the solid precipice ran that Cyclopean gouge, and deep down
within earth‘s bowels its lower delvings yawned. It was no quarry of man, and the concave
sides were scarred with great squares yards wide which told of the size of the blocks once
hewn by nameless hands and chisels. High over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and
croaked, and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable
presences haunting the endless blackness. There Carter stood in the narrow way amidst the
twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him; tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as
far as he could see, and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and
unearthly quarry.
All at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control, leaping past him and darting on in
a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north. Stones kicked by its flying
hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of
striking bottom; but Carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after
the flying steed. Soon the left-hand cliffs resumed their course, making the way once more a
narrow lane; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its
desperate flight.
Once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast, and doubled his speed from
this encouragement. He was covering miles, and little by little the way was broadening in front
till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north. The gaunt
grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the right-hand crags,
and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the
dark and limitless plain. And once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears, plainer than
before, but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they
were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak. These beats were ruthless and
purposeful, and they were behind him.
Carter‘s pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing, for though he dared not
glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or
mentionable. His yak must have heard or felt it first, and he did not like to ask himself whether
it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit.
Meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind, so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of
sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost. He could not see the hoofprints of his
yak, but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping; mingled now and then
with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings. That he was losing ground seemed
unhappily clear to him, and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert
of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands. Only those remote and impassable peaks on the
right gave him any sense of direction, and even they were less clear as the grey twilight
waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place.
Then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing. He had
thought it for some moments a range of black mountains, but now he saw it was something
more. The phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly, and even silhouetted
parts of it as low vapours glowed behind. How distant it was he could not tell, but it must have
been very far. It was thousands of feet high, stretching in a great concave arc from the grey
impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces, and had once indeed been a ridge of
mighty onyx hills. But now those hills were hills no more, for some hand greater than man‘s
had touched them. Silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls, crowned
with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever. All in a great half circle
they squatted, those dog-like mountains carven into monstrous watching statues, and their
right hands were raised in menace against mankind.
It was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to
move, but as Carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy laps great forms whose
motions were no delusion. Winged and whirring, those forms grew larger each moment, and
the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end. They were not any birds or bats known
elsewhere on earth or in dreamland, for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a
horse‘s. Carter knew that they must be the shantak-birds of ill rumour, and wondered no more
what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert. And as
he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him; where indeed was trotting
the squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend, grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a
noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether
pits.
Trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed
around in great unholy circles, Randolph Carter did not lose consciousness. Lofty and horrible
those titan gargoyles towered above him, while the slant-eyed merchant leaped down from
his yak and stood grinning before the captive. Then the man motioned Carter to mount one of
the repugnant shantaks, helping him up as his judgment struggled with his loathing. It was
hard work ascending, for the shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers, and those scales
are very slippery. Once he was seated, the slant-eyed man hopped up behind him, leaving
the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the
incredible bird colossi.
There now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up and eastward toward
the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which Leng was said to lie. Far
above the clouds they flew, till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the
folk of Inganok have never seen, and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist.
Carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below, and saw upon their topmost peaks
strange caves which made him think of those on Ngranek; but he did not question his captor
about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse-headed shantak
appeared oddly fearful of them, hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they
were left far in the rear.
The shantak now flew lower, revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain
whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires. As they descended there appeared at
intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid
light. And there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous
rattle of crotala which proved at once that Inganok‘s people are right in their geographick
rumours. For travellers have heard such sounds before, and know that they float only from the
cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted place of evil and mystery
which is Leng.
Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing, and Carter was curious as to what manner
of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have ever been to Leng, and the place is known
only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar. Very slowly and awkwardly did those forms
leap, and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that Carter did not
wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend, or the fear in which all
dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau. As the shantak flew lower, the repulsiveness
of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept straining
his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before.
They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to wear a sort of wig or
headpiece with small horns. Of other clothing they had none, but most of them were quite
furry. Behind they had dwarfish tails, and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive
width of their mouths. Then he knew what they were, and that they did not wear any wigs or
headpieces after all. For the cryptic folk of Leng were of one race with the uncomfortable
merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at Dylath-Leen; those not quite human
merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous moon-things! They were indeed the same
dark folk who had shanghaied Carter on their noisome galley so long ago, and whose kith he
had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city, with the
leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous
and amorphous masters. Now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from, and
shuddered at the thought that Leng must be known to these formless abominations from the
moon.
But the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers,
and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow. Day
came, and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern
world, and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence. At times the slant-
eyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language, and the shantak would
answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass. All this while the
land was getting higher, and finally they came to a windswept table-land which seemed the
very roof of a blasted and tenantless world. There, all alone in the hush and the dusk and the
cold, rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building, around which a circle of crude
monoliths stood. In all this arrangement there was nothing human, and Carter surmised from
old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places, the
remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the high-priest not to be
described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the Other Gods and
their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.
The loathsome bird now settled to the ground, and the slant-eyed man hopped down and
helped his captive alight. Of the purpose of his seizure Carter now felt very sure; for clearly
the slant-eyed merchant was an agent of the darker powers, eager to drag before his masters
a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown Kadath and the saying of a
prayer before the faces of the Great Ones in their onyx castle. It seemed likely that this
merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the moon-things in Dylath-Leen,
and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled; taking the victim to some
dread rendezvous with monstrous Nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of
unknown Kadath had been tried. Leng and the cold waste north of Inganok must be close to
the Other Gods, and there the passes to Kadath are well guarded.
The slant-eyed man was small, but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was
obeyed; so Carter followed where he led, and passed within the circle of standing rocks and
into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery. There were no lights inside,
but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid bas-reliefs and prodded his prisoner
on through mazes of narrow winding corridors. On the walls of the corridors were painted
frightful scenes older than history, and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth. After
countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still, for the cold and dryness of hideous Leng
keep alive many primal things. Carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving
lamp, and shuddered at the tale they told.
Through those archaic frescoes Leng‘s annals stalked; and the horned, hooved, and wide-
mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities. There were scenes of old wars,
wherein Leng‘s almost-humans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring
vales; and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon, and of
the submission of Leng‘s people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped
and floundered and wriggled out of them. Those slippery greyish-white blasphemies they
worshipped as gods, nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were
taken away in the black galleys. The monstrous moon-beasts made their camp on a jagged
isle in the sea, and Carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone
nameless rock he had seen when sailing to Inganok; that grey accursed rock which Inganok‘s
seamen shun, and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night.
And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almost-humans; proud
and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves, and wondrous with high fanes and
carven places. Great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the
six sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza, and in that plaza was a pair of winged
colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase. Again and again were those huge
winged lions shewn, their mighty flanks of diorite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and
the cloudy phosphorescence of the night. And as Carter stumbled past their frequent and
repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were, and what city it was that the
almost-humans had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys. There could be
no mistake, for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse. Indubitably that primal
city was no less a place than storied Sarkomand, whose ruins had bleached for a million
years before the first true human saw the light, and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the
steps that lead down from dreamland to the Great Abyss.
Other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing Leng from Inganok, and the monstrous
shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges half way up. And they shewed likewise the
curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles, and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly
screaming away from them. Carter had seen those caves when he passed over them, and
had noticed their likeness to the caves on Ngranek. Now he knew that the likeness was more
than a chance one, for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens; and those bat-
wings, curving horns, barbed tails, prehensile paws, and rubbery bodies were not strange to
him. He had met those silent, flitting, and clutching creatures before; those mindless
guardians of the Great Abyss whom even the Great Ones fear, and who own not Nyarlathotep
but hoary Nodens as their lord. For they were the dreaded night-gaunts, who never laugh or
smile because they have no faces, and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the Vale of
Pnath and the passes to the outer world.
The slant-eyed merchant had now prodded Carter into a great domed space whose walls
were carved in shocking bas-reliefs, and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded
by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring. There was no light in this vast and evil-smelling
crypt, and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp
details only little by little. At the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps; and
there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having
a yellow silken mask over its face. To this being the slant-eyed man made certain signs with
his hands, and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in
silk-covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow
mask. This colloquy went on for some time, and to Carter there was something sickeningly
familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place. It made him think of
a frightful red-litten city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it; of that, and
of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond, before the rescuing rush of earth‘s
friendly cats. He knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the high-priest not to
be described, of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities, but he
feared to think just what that abhorred high-priest might be.
Then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white paws, and Carter knew what
the noisome high-priest was. And in that hideous second stark fear drove him to something
his reason would never have dared to attempt, for in all his shaken consciousness there was
room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne. He knew
that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold table-land outside, and that
even on that table-land the noxious shantak still waited; yet in spite of all this there was in his
mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling, silk-robed monstrosity.
The slant-eyed man had set his curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained altar-
stones by the pit, and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the high-priest with his hands.
Carter, hitherto wholly passive, now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of
fear, so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down
to the hellish Vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark. In almost the same second he
seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths, racing this way and
that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws
on the stones behind him, or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on
back there in lightless corridors.
After a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste, and wished he had tried to follow
backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in. True, they were so confused and
duplicated that they could not have done him much good, but he wished none the less he had
made the attempt. Those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then,
and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside. In time he became quite sure he
was not followed, and slackened his pace somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half-relief
when a new peril beset him. His lamp was waning, and he would soon be in pitch blackness
with no means of sight or guidance.
When the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark, and prayed to the Great Ones for
such help as they might afford. At times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down, and once
he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist. The farther he went the damper
it seemed to be, and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he
always chose the way which sloped downward the least. He believed, though, that his general
course was down; and the vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor
alike warned him he was burrowing deep in Leng‘s unwholesome table-land. But there was
not any warning of the thing which came at last; only the thing itself with its terror and shock
and breath-taking chaos. One moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an
almost level place, and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a
burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical.
Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it seemed to take hours of
delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he realised he was still, with the phosphorescent
clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him. All around were crumbling walls and
broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and
wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and
perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and
carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come. Ahead stretched double
rows of pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of pillars, that spoke of a broad and bygone
street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of
gardens. Far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza, and in that open
circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things. Huge
winged lions of diorite they were, with blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty feet
they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive on the ruins around
them. And Carter knew right well what they must be, for legend tells of only one such twain.
They were the changeless guardians of the Great Abyss, and these dark ruins were in truth
primordial Sarkomand.
Carter‘s first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd
debris that lay around. He wished no follower from Leng‘s hateful monastery, for along the
way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers. Of how to get from Sarkomand to the
peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain much by descending to
the grottoes of the ghouls, since he knew they were no better informed than he. The three
ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how
to reach Sarkomand in their journey back, but had planned to ask old traders in Dylath-Leen.
He did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more
that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt
he might have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng‘s plateau past the lone monastery
he dared not go unaided; for the high-priest‘s emissaries must be many, while at the journey‘s
end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with. If he could
get a boat he might sail back to Inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea, for the
primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from
Sarkomand‘s basalt quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable
thing, and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one.
Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began beating upon his
mind. All this while there had stretched before him the great corpse-like width of fabled
Sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones
and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds. Now he
saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for, and knew he was not
alone in the silence of that dead city. The glow rose and fell fitfully, flickering with a greenish
tinge which did not reassure the watcher. And when he crept closer, down the littered street
and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls, he perceived that it was a campfire
near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it, and a lethal odour
hanging heavily over all. Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship
riding at anchor, and Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one
of the dreaded black galleys from the moon.
Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he saw a stirring among
the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound. It was the frightened
meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure
as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear,
and crept forward again instead of retreating. Once in crossing an open street he wriggled
worm-like on his stomach, and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a
noise among heaps of fallen marble. But always he succeeded in avoiding discovery, so that
in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar whence he could watch the whole
green-litten scene of action. There, around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar
fungi, there squatted a stinking circle of the toad-like moon-beasts and their almost-human
slaves. Some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames, and at
intervals applying their white-hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing
before the leaders of the party. From the motions of their tentacles Carter could see that the
blunt-snouted moon-beasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely, and vast was his horror when
he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none
other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set
out from the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps.
The number of malodorous moon-beasts about that greenish fire was very great, and Carter
saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies. Of how the ghouls had been
captured he could not guess; but fancied that the grey toad-like blasphemies had heard them
inquire in Dylath-Leen concerning the way to Sarkomand and had not wished them to
approach so closely the hateful plateau of Leng and the high-priest not to be described. For a
moment he pondered on what he ought to do, and recalled how near he was to the gate of
the ghouls‘ black kingdom. Clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and
descend at once to the gulf, where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those
above, and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to
wipe out the moon-beasts from the black galley. It occurred to him that the portal, like other
gates to the abyss, might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not fear these
faceless creatures now. He had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the
ghouls, and the ghoul which was Pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they
understood.
So Carter began another silent crawl through the ruins, edging slowly toward the great central
plaza and the winged lions. It was ticklish work, but the moon-beasts were pleasantly busy
and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered
stones. At last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunted trees and
briers that had grown up therein. The gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly
glow of the phosphorescent night clouds, but he manfully persisted toward them and
presently crept round to their faces, knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty
darkness which they guard. Ten feet apart crouched the mocking-faced beasts of diorite,
brooding on Cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled into fearsome bas-reliefs.
Betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters
of onyx. Midway in this space a black well opened, and Carter soon saw that he had indeed
reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of
nightmare.
Terrible is the memory of that dark descent, in which hours wore themselves away whilst
Carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery
stairs. So worn and narrow were the steps, and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth, that
the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the
ultimate pits; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian night-gaunts would
suddenly pounce upon him, if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage. All
about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs, and he felt that the air of these choking depths
was not made for mankind. In time he became very numb and somnolent, moving more from
automatic impulse than from reasoned will; nor did he realise any change when he stopped
moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind. He was flying very rapidly
through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had
performed their duty.
Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold, damp clutch of the faceless flutterers, Carter
remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the
wind and chaos of flight. Mindless though night-gaunts are said to be, the effect was
instantaneous; for all tickling stopped at once, and the creatures hastened to shift their captive
to a more comfortable position. Thus encouraged, Carter ventured some explanations; telling
of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moon-beasts, and of the need of assembling
a party to rescue them. The night-gaunts, though inarticulate, seemed to understand what
was said; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight. Suddenly the dense
blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth, and there opened up ahead one of
those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw. Scattered tombstones and
osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place; and as Carter gave a loud meep of
urgent summons, a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery, dog-like tenants. The night-
gaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet, afterward withdrawing a little and
forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer.
Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company, and four of
them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather
such troops as might be available for the rescue. After a long wait a ghoul of some importance
appeared, and made significant signs to the night-gaunts, causing two of the latter to fly off
into the dark. Thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of night-gaunts
on the plain, till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them. Meanwhile fresh ghouls
crawled out of the burrows one by one, all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle
array not far from the huddled night-gaunts. In time there appeared that proud and influential
ghoul which was once the artist Richard Pickman of Boston, and to him Carter glibbered a
very full account of what had occurred. The erstwhile Pickman, surprised to greet his ancient
friend again, seemed very much impressed, and held a conference with other chiefs a little
apart from the growing throng.
Finally, after scanning the ranks with care, the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and
began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and night-gaunts. A large detachment of the
horned flyers vanished at once, while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees
with extended fore legs, awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one. As each ghoul
reached the pair of night-gaunts to which he was assigned, he was taken up and borne away
into the blackness; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for Carter, Pickman, and the
other chiefs, and a few pairs of night-gaunts. Pickman explained that night-gaunts are the
advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls, and that the army was issuing forth to
Sarkomand to deal with the moon-beasts. Then Carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached
the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp, slippery paws. Another moment and all
were whirling in wind and darkness; endlessly up, up, up to the gate of the winged lions and
the spectral ruins of primal Sarkomand.
When, after a great interval, Carter saw again the sickly light of Sarkomand‘s nocturnal sky, it
was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he
felt sure, must be almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would
be needed. The greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly, though the absence of
ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce. Softly
glibbering directions to their steeds, and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead, the
ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the
evil flame. Carter was now beside Pickman in the front rank of ghouls, and saw as they
approached the noisome camp that the moon-beasts were totally unprepared. The three
prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire, while their toad-like captors slumped drowsily
about in no certain order. The almost-human slaves were asleep, even the sentinels shirking
a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory.
The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden, each of the
greyish toad-like blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized by a group of
night-gaunts before a sound was made. The moon-beasts, of course, were voiceless; and
even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence.
Horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts
clutched them, but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons.
When a moon-beast writhed too violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink
tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles. Carter
expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans.
They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives, trusting the
rest to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss,
to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dwellers in darkness
whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims. Meanwhile the three
bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk, whilst various
parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moon-beasts, and boarded the
evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general
defeat. Surely enough, the capture had been thorough; for not a sign of further life could the
victors detect. Carter, anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland, urged
them not to sink the anchored galley; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for
his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio. On the ship were found some very curious
objects and decorations, some of which Carter cast at once into the sea.
Ghouls and night-gaunts now formed themselves in separate groups, the former questioning
their rescued fellows anent past happenings. It appeared that the three had followed Carter‘s
directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood to Dylath-Leen by way of Nir and the
Skai, stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the
fashion of a man‘s walk. In Dylath-Leen‘s taverns their grotesque ways and faces had
aroused much comment; but they had persisted in asking the way to Sarkomand until at last
an old traveller was able to tell them. Then they knew that only a ship for Lelag-Leng would
serve their purpose, and prepared to wait patiently for such a vessel.
But evil spies had doubtless reported much; for shortly a black galley put into port, and the
wide-mouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern. Wine was
produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby, and after
that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as Carter had once found
himself. This time, however, the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique
Sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their captives before the high-priest not to be described.
They had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which Inganok‘s mariners shun, and
the ghouls had there seen for the first time the real masters of the ship; being sickened
despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome
odour. There, too, were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toad-like resident garrison—
such pastimes as give rise to the night-howlings which men fear. After that had come the
landing at ruined Sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures, whose continuance the
present rescue had prevented.
Future plans were next discussed, the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged
rock and the extermination of the toad-like garrison there. To this, however, the night-gaunts
objected; since the prospect of flying over water did not please them. Most of the ghouls
favoured the design, but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged night-
gaunts. Thereupon Carter, seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley, offered to
teach them the use of the great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented. Grey
day had now come, and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed
into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers‘ benches. Carter found them fairly
apt at learning, and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour. Not
till three days later, however, did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest. Then, the
rowers trained and the night-gaunts safely stowed in the forecastle, the party set sail at last;
Pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing modes of approach and
procedure.
On the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard. Such was their timbre that all
the galley‘s crew shook visibly; but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew
precisely what those howlings meant. It was not thought best to attempt an attack by night, so
the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day. When
the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes, and the galley
drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the
dull sky. The sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and there could be seen
the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings, and the low railings guarding travelled high
roads. No ship of men had ever come so near the place, or at least, had never come so near
and departed again; but Carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on,
rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio
described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands.
The headlands were prolongations of the island proper, and came so closely together that
only one ship at a time might pass between them. There seemed to be no watchers on the
outside, so the galley was steered boldly through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant
foetid harbour beyond. Here, however, all was bustle and activity; with several ships lying at
anchor along a forbidding stone quay, and scores of almost-human slaves and moon-beasts
by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched
to lumbering lorries. There was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the
wharves, with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the
rock. Of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say, but the things one
saw on the outside were far from encouraging.
At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness; those
with eyes staring intently, and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly.
They did not, of course, realise that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much
like the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below.
By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon
as the wharf was touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the
instincts of those almost mindless creatures. Marooned on the rock, the horned flyers would
first of all seize whatever living things they found there, and afterward, quite helpless to think
except in terms of the homing instinct, would forget their fear of water and fly swiftly back to
the abyss; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark, from which not
much would emerge alive.
The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their simple
instructions, while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves.
Presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront, and Carter saw that the motions of the galley
had begun to excite suspicion. Evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock,
and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the
almost-human slaves whose places they were taking. Some silent alarm must have been
given, for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moon-beasts began to pour from the little
black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right. A rain of
curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf, felling two ghouls and slightly
wounding another; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of
whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and Cyclopean bats.
The jellyish moon-beasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading
ship, but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought of such things no more. It was a
very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime, and
tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and
up the winding roadway to the reaches above. Sometimes a group of the black flutterers
would drop a toad-like prisoner from aloft by mistake, and the manner in which the victim
would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell. When the last of the night-gaunts had
left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal, and the rowers pulled
quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of
battle and conquest.
The Pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up their rudimentary
minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea, and kept the galley standing about a
mile off the jagged rock while he waited and dressed the wounds of the injured men. Night
fell, and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds, and all the
while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the night-gaunts‘
flight. Toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the topmost pinnacle,
and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm. Just before daybreak the swarm
seemed to scatter, and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance
toward the northeast. Once or twice something seemed to fall from the thinning swarm into
the sea; but Carter did not worry, since he knew from observation that the toad-like moon-
beasts cannot swim. At length, when the ghouls were satisfied that all the night-gaunts had
left for Sarkomand and the Great Abyss with their doomed burdens, the galley put back into
the harbour betwixt the grey headlands; and all the hideous company landed and roamed
curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the
solid stone.
Frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts; for the remnants of
unfinished pastimes were many, and in various stages of departure from their primal state.
Carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive, and fled precipitately
from a few other things about which he could not be very positive. The stench-filled houses
were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were
painted inside with nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, implements, and
ornaments lay about; including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not
found on the earth. These latter did not, despite their material, invite either appropriation or
long inspection; and Carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces.
The scattered spears and javelins he collected, and with Pickman‘s approval distributed
among the ghouls. Such devices were new to the dog-like lopers, but their relative simplicity
made them easy to master after a few concise hints.
The upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes, and in numerous hewn
chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the
worship of things more monstrous than the mild gods atop Kadath. From the rear of one great
temple stretched a low black passage which Carter followed far into the rock with a torch till
he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions, whose vaultings were covered with
daemoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the
hideous monastery of Leng where broods alone the high-priest not to be described. On the
distant shadowy side, beyond the noisome well, he thought he discerned a small door of
strangely wrought bronze; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it
or even approaching it, and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they
shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel. The ghouls had observed
the unfinished pastimes of the moon-beasts, and had profited in their fashion. They had also
found a hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal
and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the rescued trio, remembering its effect on them
in Dylath-Leen, had warned their company to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines
there was a great store, both rough and polished, in one of the vaults near the water; but
when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them. Carter did not
try to carry any away, since he knew too much about those which had mined them.
Suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves, and all the
loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront.
Betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing, and it could be but a
moment before the almost-humans on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give
the alarm to the monstrous things below. Fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and
javelins which Carter had distributed amongst them; and at his command, sustained by the
being that was Pickman, they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing
of the ship. Presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew‘s discovery of the
changed state of things, and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior
numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account. After a moment of hesitation
the newcomers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again, but not for an
instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted. Either the dark ship would seek
reinforcements, or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island; hence a party of scouts
was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy‘s course would be.
In a very few minutes a ghoul returned breathless to say that the moon-beasts and almost-
humans were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands, and
ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety. Almost
immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flume-like strait, but only for a
second. Then, a few moments later, a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that
another party was landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than the
size of the galley would seem to allow for. The ship itself, moving slowly with only one
sparsely manned tier of oars, soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs, and lay to in the foetid
harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible use.
By this time Carter and Pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties, one to meet each
of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town. The first two at once scrambled
up the rocks in their respective directions, while the third was subdivided into a land party and
a sea party. The sea party, commanded by Carter, boarded the anchored galley and rowed
out to meet the undermanned galley of the newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through
the strait to the open sea. Carter did not at once pursue it, for he knew he might be needed
more acutely near the town.
Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moon-beasts and almost-humans had lumbered
up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey
twilight sky. The thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine, and the general
effect of those hybrid, half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour
given off by the toad-like lunar blasphemies. Then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into
sight and joined the silhouetted panorama. Javelins began to fly from both sides, and the
swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually joined the
hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony.
Now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the
harbour inside, in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers
whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles.
For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west cliff the invaders were
completely annihilated. On the east cliff, however, where the leader of the moon-beast party
appeared to be present, the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating to the
slopes of the pinnacle proper. Pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from
the party in the town, and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat. Then,
when the western battle was over, the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their
hard-pressed fellows; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow
ridge of the headland. The almost-humans were by this time all slain, but the last of the toad-
like horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting
paws. The time for javelins was now nearly past, and the fight became a hand-to-hand
contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge.
As fury and recklessness increased, the number falling into the sea became very great.
Those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers, but of those
striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks,
while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moon-beasts. The cliffs were
unscalable except where the monsters had debarked, so that none of the ghouls on the rocks
could rejoin their battle-line. Some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the
moon-beasts above, but a few survived to be rescued. When the security of the land parties
seemed assured, Carter‘s galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile
ship far out to sea; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in
the ocean. Several moon-beasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the way.
Finally, the moon-beasts‘ galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army
concentrated in one place, Carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the
enemy‘s rear; after which the fight was short-lived indeed. Attacked from both sides, the
noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea, till by evening the
ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them. The hostile galley, meanwhile,
had disappeared; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before
any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors.
So by night Pickman and Carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care, finding
that over a fourth had been lost in the day‘s battles. The wounded were placed on bunks in
the galley, for Pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one‘s
own wounded, and the able-bodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places
as they might most usefully fill. Under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley
sailed, and Carter was not sorry to be departing from that island of unwholesome secrets,
whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered
restlessly in his fancy. Dawn found the ship in sight of Sarkomand‘s ruined quays of basalt,
where a few night-gaunt sentries still waited, squatting like black horned gargoyles on the
broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the
years of man.
The ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of Sarkomand, despatching a messenger
for enough night-gaunts to serve them as steeds. Pickman and the other chiefs were effusive
in their gratitude for the aid Carter had lent them; and Carter now began to feel that his plans
were indeed maturing well, and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome
allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland, but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods
atop unknown Kadath, and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his
slumbers. Accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders; telling what he knew
of the cold waste wherein Kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains
carven into double-headed images which guard it. He spoke of the fear of shantaks for night-
gaunts, and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up
on the gaunt grey peaks that divide Inganok from hateful Leng. He spoke, too, of the things
he had learnt concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the
high-priest not to be described; how even the Great Ones fear them, and how their ruler is not
the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep at all, but hoary and immemorial Nodens, Lord of the Great
Abyss.
All these things Carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls, and presently outlined that request
which he had in mind, and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had
so lately rendered the rubbery, dog-like lopers. He wished very much, he said, for the services
of enough night-gaunts to bear him safely through the air past the realm of shantaks and
carven mountains, and up into the cold waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal.
He desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste to plead with the
Great Ones for the sunset city they denied him, and felt sure that the night-gaunts could take
him thither without trouble; high above the perils of the plain, and over the hideous double
heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk. For the
horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth, since the Great
Ones themselves dread them. And even were unexpected things to come from the Other
Gods, who are prone to oversee the affairs of earth‘s milder gods, the night-gaunts need not
fear; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not
Nyarlathotep for their master, but bow only to potent and archaic Nodens.
A flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts, Carter glibbered, would surely be enough to keep any
combination of shantaks at a distance; though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls
in the party to manage the creatures, their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies
than to men. The party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that
fabulous onyx citadel might have, waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he
ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth. If any ghouls chose to escort
him into the throne-room of the Great Ones, he would be thankful, for their presence would
add weight and importance to his plea. He would not, however, insist upon this but merely
wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown Kadath; the final journey being
either to the marvellous sunset city itself, in case the gods proved favourable, or back to the
earthward Gate of Deeper Slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless.
Whilst Carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention, and as the moments
advanced the sky became black with clouds of those night-gaunts for which messengers had
been sent. The winged horrors settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army, waiting
respectfully as the dog-like chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller. The ghoul
that was Pickman glibbered gravely with its fellows, and in the end Carter was offered far
more than he had at most expected. As he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the
moon-beasts, so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever
returned; lending him not merely a few of their allied night-gaunts, but their entire army as
they encamped, veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled night-gaunts alike, save only a
small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged
rock in the sea. They would set out through the air whenever he might wish, and once arrived
on Kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before
earth‘s gods in their onyx castle.
Moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words, Carter made plans with the ghoulish
leaders for his audacious voyage. The army would fly high, they decided, over hideous Leng
with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks
to confer with the shantak-frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed their
summits. They would then, according to what advice they might receive from those denizens,
choose their final course; approaching unknown Kadath either through the desert of carven
mountains north of Inganok, or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive Leng itself.
Dog-like and soulless as they are, the ghouls and night-gaunts had no dread of what those
untrodden deserts might reveal; nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of Kadath
towering lone with its onyx castle of mystery.
About midday the ghouls and night-gaunts prepared for flight, each ghoul selecting a suitable
pair of horned steeds to bear him. Carter was placed well up toward the head of the column
beside Pickman, and in front of the whole a double line of riderless night-gaunts was provided
as a vanguard. At a brisk meep from Pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare
cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial Sarkomand; higher
and higher, till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared, and the cold, sterile
table-land of Leng‘s outskirts laid open to sight. Still higher flew the black host, till even this
table-land grew small beneath them; and as they worked northward over the windswept
plateau of horror Carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the
squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful silken-masked blasphemy from
whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped. This time no descent was made as the army
swept bat-like over the sterile landscape, passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone
villages at a great altitude, and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved,
horned almost-humans that dance and pipe eternally therein. Once they saw a shantak-bird
flying low over the plain, but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the
north in grotesque panic.
At dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of Inganok, and hovered
about those strange caves near the summits which Carter recalled as so frightful to the
shantaks. At the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty
burrow a stream of horned black flyers; with which the ghouls and night-gaunts of the party
conferred at length by means of ugly gestures. It soon became clear that the best course
would be that over the cold waste north of Inganok, for Leng‘s northward reaches are full of
unseen pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike; abysmal influences centring in certain white
hemispherical buildings on curious knolls, which common folklore associates unpleasantly
with the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.
Of Kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing, save that there must be some
mighty marvel toward the north, over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand
guard. They hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues
beyond, and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally; but of definite
data they had nothing to give. So Carter and his party thanked them kindly; and, crossing the
topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of Inganok, dropped below the level of the
phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles
that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock.
There they squatted, in a hellish half-circle, their legs on the desert sand and their mitres
piercing the luminous clouds; sinister, wolf-like, and double-headed, with faces of fury and
right hands raised, dully and malignly watching the rim of man‘s world and guarding with
horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not man‘s. From their hideous laps rose evil
shantaks of elephantine bulk, but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of night-
gaunts was sighted in the misty sky. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army
flew, and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose. Less and less luminous
grew the clouds, till at length Carter could see only blackness around him; but never did the
winged steeds falter, bred as they were in earth‘s blackest crypts, and seeing not with any
eyes, but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms. On and on they flew, past winds
of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import; ever in thickest darkness, and covering such
prodigious spaces that Carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earth‘s
dreamland.
Then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above. All below was still
black, but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness
they had never possessed elsewhere. It was not that the figures of the constellations were
different, but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly
failed to make plain. Everything focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the
glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then
the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the
frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead. Carter looked toward the east where the great
ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of Inganok, and saw against the stars
a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence. It was more broken now, with
yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles; and Carter studied closely the suggestive
turns and inclinations of that grotesque outline, which seemed to share with the stars some
subtle northward urge.
They were flying past at a tremendous speed, so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch
details; when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and
moving object against the stars, whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party.
The ghouls had likewise glimpsed it, for he heard their low glibbering all about him, and for a
moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak, of a size vastly greater than that of the
average specimen. Soon, however, he saw that this theory would not hold; for the shape of
the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird. Its outline against the
stars, necessarily vague as it was, resembled rather some huge mitred head or pair of heads
infinitely magnified; and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a
wingless one. Carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on, but soon perceived
that it had parts below the parts he had first seen, since it blotted out all the stars in places
where the ridge was deeply cleft.
Then came a wide gap in the range, where the hideous reaches of transmontane Leng were
joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass through which the stars shone wanly.
Carter watched this gap with intense care, knowing that he might see outlined against the sky
beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles. The object
had now floated ahead a trifle, and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would
presently appear in full-length silhouette. Gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared
the gap, slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish
army. For another minute suspense was keen, and then the brief instant of full silhouette and
revelation came; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and half-choked meep of cosmic
fear, and to the soul of the traveller a chill that has never wholly left it. For the mammoth
bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a head—a mitred double head—and below
it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it; the mountain-high
monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence; the hyaena-like distortion of a giant anthropoid
shape that trotted blackly against the sky, its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads reaching
half way to the zenith.
Carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud, for he was an old dreamer; but he
looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous
heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks, bobbing along stealthily after the first one.
And straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the
southern stars, tiptoeing wolf-like and lumberingly, their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet
in the air. The carven mountains, then, had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north
of Inganok with right hands uplifted. They had duties to perform, and were not remiss. But it
was horrible that they never spoke, and never even made a sound in walking.
Meanwhile the ghoul that was Pickman had glibbered an order to the night-gaunts, and the
whole army soared higher into the air. Up toward the stars the grotesque column shot, till
nothing stood out any longer against the sky; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor
the carven and mitred mountains that walked. All was blackness beneath as the fluttering
legions surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether, and never
a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them. The
farther they went, the faster they flew, till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a
rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit. Carter wondered how with such speed the
earth could still stretch beneath them, but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have
strange properties. That they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain, and he fancied
that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasised their northward focus; gathering
themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole, as the folds of
a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein.
Then he noticed with terror that the wings of the night-gaunts were not flapping any more. The
horned and faceless steeds had folded their membraneous appendages, and were resting
quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on. A force not of
earth had seized on the army, and ghouls and night-gaunts alike were powerless before a
current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever
returned. At length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead, thereafter rising steadily
as they approached, and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars. Carter saw
that it must be some beacon on a mountain, for only a mountain could rise so vast as seen
from so prodigious a height in the air.
Higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it, till half the northern sky was
obscured by the rugged conical mass. Lofty as the army was, that pale and sinister beacon
rose above it, towering monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth, and tasting the
atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel. No mountain known of
man was that which loomed before them. The high clouds far below were but a fringe for its
foothills. The gasping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins. Scornful and
spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven, black in eternal night, and crowned
with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment
clearer. Ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it, and Carter shivered in fear lest all the
hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that Cyclopean cliff.
Higher and higher rose the light, till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith and winked
down at the flyers with lurid mockery. All the north beneath it was blackness now; dread, stony
blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights, with only that pale winking beacon perched
unreachably at the top of all vision. Carter studied the light more closely, and saw at last what
lines its inky background made against the stars. There were towers on that titan mountain-
top; horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any
dreamable workmanship of man; battlements and terraces of wonder and menace, all limned
tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost
rim of sight. Capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal
thought, and in it glowed the daemon-light. Then Randolph Carter knew that his quest was
done, and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions; the
fabulous, the incredible home of the Great Ones atop unknown Kadath.
Even as he realised this thing, Carter noticed a change in the course of the helplessly wind-
sucked party. They were rising abruptly now, and it was plain that the focus of their flight was
the onyx castle where the pale light shone. So close was the great black mountain that its
sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward, and in the darkness they could discern
nothing upon it. Vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above,
and Carter could see that it was well-nigh blasphemous in its immensity. Well might its stones
have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill
pass north of Inganok, for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as an ant
on the steps of earth‘s loftiest fortress. The pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed
turrets glowed with a sallow, sickly flare, so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls
of slippery onyx. The pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in
one of the loftiest towers, and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain Carter
thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse. It was a
strangely arched window, of a design wholly alien to earth.
The solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle, and it
seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated. Vast walls shot up, and there was
a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were swept. All was night in the titan
courtyard, and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal
engulfed the column. Vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx,
and Carter could never tell what Cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of
his endless aërial twisting. Always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness, and never a
sound, touch, or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery. Large as the army of ghouls and
night-gaunts was, it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle. And
when at last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single tower room
whose lofty window had served as a beacon, it took Carter long to discern the far walls and
high, distant ceiling, and to realise that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside.
Randolph Carter had hoped to come into the throne-room of the Great Ones with poise and
dignity, flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in ceremonial order, and offering
his prayer as a free and potent master among dreamers. He had known that the Great Ones
themselves are not beyond a mortal‘s power to cope with, and had trusted to luck that the
Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at
the crucial moment, as they had so often done before when men sought out earth‘s gods in
their home or on their mountains. And with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even
the Other Gods if need were, knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters, and that night-
gaunts own not Nyarlathotep but only archaick Nodens for their lord. But now he saw that
supernal Kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels,
and that the Other Gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild, feeble gods of earth.
Void as they are of lordship over ghouls and night-gaunts, the mindless, shapeless
blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must; so that it was not in state
as a free and potent master of dreamers that Randolph Carter came into the Great Ones‘
throne-room with his ghouls. Swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars, and
dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste, all that army floated captive and helpless in
the lurid light, dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of
fright dissolved.
Before no golden dais had Randolph Carter come, nor was there any august circle of
crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes, long-lobed ears, thin nose, and pointed chin
whose kinship to the carven face on Ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer
might pray. Save for that one tower room the onyx castle atop Kadath was dark, and the
masters were not there. Carter had come to unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but he had
not found the gods. Yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so
little less than that of all outdoors, and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to
sight in thin, curling mists. Earth‘s gods were not there, it was true, but of subtler and less
visible presences there could be no lack. Where the mild gods are absent, the Other Gods
are not unrepresented; and certainly, the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless. In
what outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself, Carter could by no means
imagine. He felt that his visit had been expected, and wondered how close a watch had all
along been kept upon him by the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. It is Nyarlathotep, horror of
infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the Other Gods, that the fungous moon-
beasts serve; and Carter thought of the black galley that had vanished when the tide of battle
turned against the toad-like abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea.
Reflecting upon these things, he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his nightmare
company when there rang without warning through that pale-litten and limitless chamber the
hideous blast of a daemon trumpet. Three times pealed that frightful brazen scream, and
when the echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away Randolph Carter saw that he
was alone. Whither, why, and how the ghouls and night-gaunts had been snatched from sight
was not for him to divine. He knew only that he was suddenly alone, and that whatever
unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earth‘s friendly dreamland.
Presently from the chamber‘s uttermost reaches a new sound came. This, too, was a
rhythmic trumpeting; but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had
dissolved his grisly cohorts. In this low fanfare echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal
dream; exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly
alien cadence. Odours of incense came to match the golden notes; and overhead a great light
dawned, its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth‘s spectrum, and following the song
of the trumpet in weird symphonic harmonies. Torches flared in the distance, and the beat of
drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancy.
Out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incense filed twin columns of giant black
slaves with loin-cloths of iridescent silk. Upon their heads were strapped vast helmet-like
torches of glittering metal, from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous
spirals. In their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras,
while their left hands grasped long, thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn. Armlets and
anklets of gold they had, and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held
its wearer to a sober gait. That they were true black men of earth‘s dreamland was at once
apparent, but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were wholly things of our
earth. Ten feet from Carter the columns stopped, and as they did so each trumpet flew
abruptly to its bearer‘s thick lips. Wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed, and wilder still
the cry that chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice.
Then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode; a tall, slim figure with
the young face of an antique Pharaoh, gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden
pshent that glowed with inherent light. Close up to Carter strode that regal figure; whose
proud carriage and swart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen
archangel, and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour. It
spoke, and in its mellow tones there rippled the mild music of Lethean streams.
―Randolph Carter,‖ said the voice, ―you have come to see the Great Ones whom it is unlawful
for men to see. Watchers have spoken of this thing, and the Other Gods have grunted as they
rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where
broods the daemon-sultan whose name no lips dare speak aloud.
―When Barzai the Wise climbed Hatheg-Kla to see the Great Ones dance and howl above the
clouds in the moonlight he never returned. The Other Gods were there, and they did what
was expected. Zenig of Aphorat sought to reach unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and his
skull is now set in a ring on the little finger of one whom I need not name.
―But you, Randolph Carter, have braved all things of earth‘s dreamland, and burn still with the
flame of quest. You came not as one curious, but as one seeking his due, nor have you failed
ever in reverence toward the mild gods of earth. Yet have these gods kept you from the
marvellous sunset city of your dreams, and wholly through their own small covetousness; for
verily, they craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned, and vowed
that henceforward no other spot should be their abode.
―They are gone from their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in your marvellous city. All
through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day, and when the sun sets they go out in
the perfumed gardens and watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades, arched
bridges and silver-basined fountains, and wide streets with blossom-laden urns and ivory
statues in gleaming rows. And when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew, and sit on
carved benches of porphyry scanning the stars, or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the
town‘s steep northward slopes, where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables
shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles.
―The gods love your marvellous city, and walk no more in the ways of the gods. They have
forgotten the high places of earth, and the mountains that knew their youth. The earth has no
longer any gods that are gods, and only the Other Ones from outer space hold sway on
unremembered Kadath. Far away in a valley of your own childhood, Randolph Carter, play the
heedless Great Ones. You have dreamed too well, O wise arch-dreamer, for you have drawn
dream‘s gods away from the world of all men‘s visions to that which is wholly yours; having
builded out of your boyhood‘s small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that have
gone before.
―It is not well that earth‘s gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on, and their realm for
the Others to sway in the dark manner of Others. Fain would the powers from outside bring
chaos and horror to you, Randolph Carter, who are the cause of their upsetting, but that they
know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world. In that half-waking
dreamland which is yours, no power of uttermost night may pursue; and only you can send
the selfish Great Ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city, back through the northern
twilight to their wonted place atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste.
―So, Randolph Carter, in the name of the Other Gods I spare you and charge you to serve my
will. I charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours, and to send thence the drowsy truant
gods for whom the dream-world waits. Not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods, that
fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals, that mystery whose place and
meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming, and
tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and
momentous. Not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder, for truly, it is but
the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening
path. Behold! It is not over unknown seas but back over well-known years that your quest
must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of
magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes.
―For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have
seen and loved in youth. It is the glory of Boston‘s hillside roofs and western windows aflame
with sunset; of the flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles flows drowsily.
These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the
springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love.
And there is antique Salem with its brooding years, and spectral Marblehead scaling its rocky
precipices into past centuries, and the glory of Salem‘s towers and spires seen afar from
Marblehead‘s pastures across the harbour against the setting sun.
―There is Providence, quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour, with terraces
of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity, and Newport climbing wraith-
like from its dreaming breakwater. Arkham is there, with its moss-grown gambrel roofs and the
rocky rolling meadows behind it; and antediluvian Kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and
deserted quays and overhanging gables, and the marvel of high cliffs and the milky-misted
ocean with tolling buoys beyond.
―Cool vales in Concord, cobbled lanes in Portsmouth, twilight bends of rustic New-Hampshire
roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and creaking well-sweeps.
Gloucester‘s salt wharves and Truro‘s windy willows. Vistas of distant steepled towns and hills
beyond hills along the North Shore, hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of
huge boulders in Rhode-Island‘s back country. Scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields;
spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn. These, Randolph
Carter, are your city; for they are yourself. New-England bore you, and into your soul she
poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die. This loveliness, moulded, crystallised, and
polished by years of memory and dreaming, is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets; and
to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail, and descend at last those
endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains, you need only
to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood.
―Look! through that window shine the stars of eternal night. Even now they are shining above
the scenes you have known and cherished, drinking of their charm that they may shine more
lovely over the gardens of dream. There is Antares—he is winking at this moment over the
roofs of Tremont Street, and you could see him from your window on Beacon Hill. Out beyond
those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me. Some day you
too may traverse them, but if you are wise you will beware such folly; for of those mortals who
have been and returned, only one preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding, clawing
horrors of the void. Terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space, and there is
more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater; even as you know from the deeds of those
who sought to deliver you into my hands, whilst I myself harboured no wish to shatter you,
and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had I not been elsewhere busy, and
certain that you would yourself find the way. Shun, then, the outer hells, and stick to the calm,
lovely things of your youth. Seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant Great
Ones, sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth, and which wait
uneasy for their return.
―Easier even than the way of dim memory is the way I will prepare for you. See! There comes
hither a monstrous shantak, led by a slave who for your peace of mind had best keep
invisible. Mount and be ready—there! Yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror. Steer
for that brightest star just south of the zenith—it is Vega, and in two hours will be just above
the terrace of your sunset city. Steer for it only till you hear a far-off singing in the high aether.
Higher than that lurks madness, so rein your shantak when the first note lures. Look then
back to earth, and you will see shining the deathless altar-flame of Ired-Naa from the sacred
roof of a temple. That temple is in your desiderate sunset city, so steer for it before you heed
the singing and are lost.
―When you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you scanned the
outspread glory, prodding the shantak till he cry aloud. That cry the Great Ones will hear and
know as they sit on their perfumed terraces, and there will come upon them such a
homesickness that all of your city‘s wonders will not console them for the absence of Kadath‘s
grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it.
―Then must you land amongst them with the shantak, and let them see and touch that
noisome and hippocephalic bird; meanwhile discoursing to them of unknown Kadath, which
you will so lately have left, and telling them how its boundless halls are lonely and unlighted,
where of old they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance. And the shantak will talk to
them in the manner of shantaks, but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling
of elder days.
―Over and over must you speak to the wandering Great Ones of their home and youth, till at
last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they have forgotten. Thereat can
you loose the waiting shantak, sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind; hearing
which the Great Ones will prance and jump with antique mirth, and forthwith stride after the
loathly bird in the fashion of gods, through the deep gulfs of heaven to Kadath‘s familiar
towers and domes.
―Then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit forever, and once more
will earth‘s gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed seat. Go now—the casement
is open and the stars await outside. Already your shantak wheezes and titters with
impatience. Steer for Vega through the night, but turn when the singing sounds. Forget not
this warning, lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness.
Remember the Other Gods; they are great and mindless and terrible, and lurk in the outer
voids. They are good gods to shun.
―Hei! Aa-shanta ’nygh! You are off! Send back earth‘s gods to their haunts on unknown
Kadath, and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my thousand other forms.
Farewell, Randolph Carter, and beware; for I am Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos!‖
And Randolph Carter, gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak, shot screamingly into space
toward the cold blue glare of boreal Vega; looking but once behind him at the clustered and
chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window
above the air and the clouds of earth‘s dreamland. Great polypous horrors slid darkly past,
and unseen bat-wings beat multitudinous around him, but still he clung to the unwholesome
mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird. The stars danced mockingly, almost
shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen
and feared before; and ever the winds of aether howled of vague blackness and loneliness
beyond the cosmos.
Then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent, and all the winds and
horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn. Trembling in waves that
golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible, there rose a timid hint of far-off melody, droning
in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not. And as that music grew, the shantak
raised its ears and plunged ahead, and Carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain. It was
a song, but not the song of any voice. Night and the spheres sang it, and it was old when
space and Nyarlathotep and the Other Gods were born.
Faster flew the shantak, and lower bent the rider, drunk with the marvels of strange gulfs, and
whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic. Then came too late the warning of the evil one, the
sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of
that song. Only to taunt had Nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous
sunset city; only to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of those truant gods
whose steps he could so easily lead back at will. For madness and the void‘s wild vengeance
are Nyarlathotep‘s only gifts to the presumptuous; and frantick though the rider strove to turn
his disgusting steed, that leering, tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless,
flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy, and headed for those unhallowed pits
whither no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion where bubbles
and blasphemes at infinity‘s centre the mindless daemon-sultan Azathoth, whose name no
lips dare speak aloud.
Unswerving and obedient to the foul legate‘s orders, that hellish bird plunged onward through
shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness, and vacuous herds of drifting entities
that pawed and groped and groped and pawed; the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, that
are like them blind and without mind, and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts.
Onward unswerving and relentless, and tittering hilariously to watch the chuckling and
hysterics into which the siren song of night and the spheres had turned, that eldritch scaly
monster bore its helpless rider; hurtling and shooting, cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning
the outermost abysses; leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter, and darting meteor-
like through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time
wherein black Azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled, maddening beat
of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes.
Onward—onward—through the screaming, cackling, and blackly populous gulfs—and then
from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to Randolph Carter the
doomed. Too well had Nyarlathotep planned his mocking and his tantalising, for he had
brought up that which no gusts of icy terror could quite efface. Home—New England—Beacon
Hill—the waking world.
―For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have
seen and loved in youth . . . the glory of Boston‘s hillside roofs and western windows aflame
with sunset; of the flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles flows drowsily . . .
this loveliness, moulded, crystallised, and polished by years of memory and dreaming, is your
terraced wonder of elusive sunsets; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and
carven rail, and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares
and prismatic fountains, you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful
boyhood.‖
Onward—onward—dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness where sightless
feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things tittered and tittered and tittered.
But the image and the thought had come, and Randolph Carter knew clearly that he was
dreaming and only dreaming, and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and
the city of his infancy still lay. Words came again—―You need only turn back to the thoughts
and visions of your wistful boyhood.‖ Turn—turn—blackness on every side, but Randolph
Carter could turn.
Thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses, Randolph Carter could turn and
move. He could move, and if he chose he could leap off the evil shantak that bore him
hurtlingly doomward at the orders of Nyarlathotep. He could leap off and dare those depths of
night that yawned interminably down, those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed
the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos‘ core. He could turn and move and leap—he
could—he would—he would—
Off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate dreamer, and
down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell. Aeons reeled, universes died and
were born again, stars became nebulae and nebulae became stars, and still Randolph Carter
fell through those endless voids of sentient blackness.
Then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos churned itself into
another futile completion, and all things became again as they were unreckoned kalpas
before. Matter and light were born anew as space once had known them; and comets, suns,
and worlds sprang flaming into life, though nothing survived to tell that they had been and
gone, been and gone, always and always, back to no first beginning.
And there was a firmament again, and a wind, and a glare of purple light in the eyes of the
falling dreamer. There were gods and presences and wills; beauty and evil, and the shrieking
of noxious night robbed of its prey. For through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a
thought and a vision of a dreamer‘s boyhood, and now there were re-made a waking world
and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things. Out of the void S‘ngac the violet
gas had pointed the way, and archaic Nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted
deeps.
Stars swelled to dawns, and dawns burst into fountains of gold, carmine, and purple, and still
the dreamer fell. Cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside.
And hoary Nodens raised a howl of triumph when Nyarlathotep, close on his quarry, stopped
baffled by a glare that seared his formless hunting-horrors to grey dust. Randolph Carter had
indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city, for he was come
again to the fair New England world that had wrought him.
So to the organ chords of morning‘s myriad whistles, and dawn‘s blaze thrown dazzling
through purple panes by the great gold dome of the State House on the hill, Randolph Carter
leaped shoutingly awake within his Boston room. Birds sang in hidden gardens and the
perfume of trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared. Beauty and
light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured, while a
sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that his master‘s start and shriek had
disturbed. And vast infinities away, past the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted wood
and the garden lands and the Cerenerian Sea and the twilight reaches of Inganok, the
crawling chaos Nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the
cold waste, and taunted insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly
from their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city.

The Case of Charles Dexter Ward
(1927)
―The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an

I. A Result and a Prologue
1.
From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently
disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and
was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his
aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of
murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his
mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a
general physiological as well as psychological character.
In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant.
Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken
on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic
processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can
parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so
that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and
minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything
heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness,
and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a
large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a
very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians
agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond
precedent.
Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort
recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental
force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange
and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Ward‘s family physician, affirms that the patient‘s
gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his
insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and
an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and
insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter
to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youth‘s mind seem;
and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of
information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the
very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a
conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his
escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.
Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body
and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a
terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his
sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion
with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final
conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Ward‘s escape
became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr.
Waite‘s hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet
after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public
explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape.
Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number
would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the
attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all
they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey
dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while
Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on.
Ward‘s father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than
surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and
both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely
confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even
these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to
the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.
Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable
town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents‘ old
mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient
things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture,
and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These
tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form
its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information
which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a
correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as
brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally
transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was
that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears,
lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent
toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and
unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his
best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and
conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and
of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have
been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time.
Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped
patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that
he is ‗lying low‘ in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information
can be brought up to the normal.
The beginning of Ward‘s madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the
eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boy‘s last year at the Moses
Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult,
and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much
greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Ward‘s altered habits at the time,
especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a
certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose
papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court,
on Stampers‘ Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly
speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919–20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he
abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into
occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for
his forefather‘s grave.
From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close
and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and
discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left
their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles
when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919–20 would ordinarily
appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible
and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction
must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and
prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him,
he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to
madness; crediting instead Ward‘s own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered
something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true
madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient
papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some
terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to
these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and
inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and
after the patient‘s memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice
failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently
noticed.
It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare
qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that
enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youth‘s claim regarding his crucial discovery. In
the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwen‘s ancient papers found.
Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and
each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed
to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse
of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved.
Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the
problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr.
Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willett‘s
pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.
And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a
certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the
authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those
papers were borne forever from human knowledge.
2.
One must look back at Charles Ward‘s earlier life as at something belonging as much to the
past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable
show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses
Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had
always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy
is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours
were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of
antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the
Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown
University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet
as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed
somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather
than attractiveness.
His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from
the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before.
His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east
of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all
the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple
hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the
double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white
farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward
the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and
smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and
exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.
He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep
hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a
greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides
he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop
and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the child‘s first
memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills
which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic
against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The
vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue
haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.
When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and
then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he
would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would
hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the
shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered
pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard
remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It
was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and
the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great
central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements
with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they
were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments
whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.
Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old ―Town Street‖ that the
founders had laid out at the river‘s edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with
leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long
before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a
gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit
Street past the iron fence of St. John‘s hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony
House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting
Street—the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods—he would look upward to
the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the
slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles
across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespear‘s Head where the Providence Gazette and
Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist
Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and
cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering
at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down
the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of
iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst
polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such
surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder,
Dollar, Dime, and Cent.
Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into
this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades,
swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out
the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this
lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge,
where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would
pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff,
decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as
London is crowned by St. Paul‘s. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon,
when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries
with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used
to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poet‘s love for the sight,
and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the
narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned
windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron
railings.
At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in
the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower
eminence of Stampers‘ Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where
the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious
southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope
holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so
many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which
accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last
crowded the modern world from Charles Ward‘s mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon
which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919–20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible
fruition.
Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Ward‘s
antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular
attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage
instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a
curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had
discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph
Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of
highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.
Ward‘s great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain ―Ann
Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast‖, of whose paternity
the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town
records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change
of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along
with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground ‗that her
Husband‘s name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his
Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho‘ not to be credited by a loyall
Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting‘. This entry came to light upon the
accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as
one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.
It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-
great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard
vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there
remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern
times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did
appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to
imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and
forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.
Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in
the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently ―hushed-up‖
character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find
concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest
expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed
Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had
not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as
remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the
Museum at Fraunces‘ Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willett‘s opinion
formed the definite source of Ward‘s undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind
the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which
opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.
II. An Antecedent and a Horror
1.
Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and
unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled
from Salem to Providence—that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting—at
the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary
ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of
about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter
buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexter‘s at about the foot of Olney Street. His house
was built on Stampers‘ Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in
1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.
Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older
than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage
near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the
founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript
aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular
quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of
hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such
simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive
merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear
to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and
longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwen‘s incessant mixings and boilings of
chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he
brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New
York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop
across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the
drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him.
Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many
sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their
belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to
their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At
length, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger‘s advent, and without producing
more than five years‘ apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper
more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always
shewn.
Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph
Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for
graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious;
though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish.
On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to
which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his
only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett
Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of
countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the
laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and
teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange
accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved
room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed ―chymist‖—by which they meant
alchemist—would not be long in finding the Philosopher‘s Stone. The nearest neighbours to
this farm—the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away—had still queerer things to tell of certain
sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they
said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which
thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very
few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week
to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was
something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits
for windows.
Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwen‘s town house in Olney Court; not so
much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but
the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers
he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it
is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy
foreigners who comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the
incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within
which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled
conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what was known of the
Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.
In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the newcomer
had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he had naturally made
acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by
education to enjoy. His birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem
needed no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much
in very early life, living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient;
and his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman.
But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing a
visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him
which would not sound inane.
There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he had come to
find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities.
When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of King‘s Church,
he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short
while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his host‘s discourse. Charles
Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give
much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists
agree concerning Dr. Checkley‘s reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man
had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of
the gay urbanity for which he was famed.
More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the
haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and
scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in
standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best
residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and
liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-
chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library
in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most
other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his host‘s ample shelves, which
besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of
philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van
Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a
visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two
drove out at once in Mr. Merritt‘s coach.
Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but
maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and
theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him
with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting
them contributed much of the prejudice. The bizarre collection, besides a host of standard
works which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists,
daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the
doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnard‘s edition, the
Turba Philosophorum, Geber‘s Liber Investigationis, and Artephius‘ Key of Wisdom all were
there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammy‘s set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lully‘s Ars
Magna et Ultima in Zetzner‘s edition, Roger Bacon‘s Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludd‘s Clavis
Alchimiae, and Trithemius‘ De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews and
Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, upon taking down a
fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the
forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such
monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at
the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.
But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a
mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy
of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in Curwen‘s hand. The book
was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-
strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it
through. Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of
the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that
combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of his days,
writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr.
Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector. It read:
―The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an
ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the
fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method
from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal
Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his
Bodie has been incinerated.‖
It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that the worst
things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious folk; and the seasoned
salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the
great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of
protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and
slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and
supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwen‘s own clerks
and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from Martinique,
St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors
were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old
man was held. A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members
perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to
lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm on the Pawtuxet
Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place, was not
forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted
hands. Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence
wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to
the merchant.
In 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac
alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named,
understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come from the affair of the
missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way
to New France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable process far
beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was
wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be
missed, people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have
happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.
Meanwhile the merchant‘s worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual monopoly of the
town‘s trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping
establishment save the Browns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt,
rigging, iron, paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at
the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across
the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near the New Coffee-House,
depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements with the local
distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers,
made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony.
Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the Colony House
burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one—still
standing at the head of its parade in the old main street—was built in 1761. In that same year,
too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the
books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the
lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of
great round stones with a brick footwalk or ―causey‖ in the middle. About this time, also, he
built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When
the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cotton‘s hill church in 1743 and founded Deacon
Snow‘s church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with them; though his zeal and
attendance soon abated. Now, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the
shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business
fortunes if not sharply checked.
2.
The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a
full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to
pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is
the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight
abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid
disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an
extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at
such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet
farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained
abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his
accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person—save one embittered
youth, perhaps—to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he
imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide
bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett
Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily
profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.
But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued
to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great
age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would
be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been,
apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of
environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have
profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch
up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a
signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general
atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and
impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he
held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy
over them—a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their
welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the
power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years
of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have
furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongue‘s end.
About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in
the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous
marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all
ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an
alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century
and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever
be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary
courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon
whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all
easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty,
accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of
one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing
named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable
advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the
domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on
Power‘s Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance.
Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the
reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jackson‘s school
opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before
the latter‘s death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A
sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the
Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother‘s death she had kept the house, aided only
by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen
marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her
engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was
dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of
March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished
assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger
Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies
the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much
search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the
meaningless urbanity of the language:
―Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to
Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has
real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and
perpetuate its Felicity.‖
The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first
reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and
covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to
public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however,
was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons
whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by
no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at
all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife
the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme
graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from
disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which
his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long
years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful
ship‘s officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra
Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition,
was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping
husband.
On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen‘s only child Ann was born; and was christened by the
Rev. John Graves of King‘s Church, of which both husband and wife had become
communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective
Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage
two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought
to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the
widow‘s change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the
feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very
curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with
him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution.
Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast
Potter had been an Episcopalian.
Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly
out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had
painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and
since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been
executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old
diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar
shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm
on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or
suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery.
Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to
the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject.
His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such
leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the
cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of
the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was
thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared
each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespear‘s Head. In politics he ardently supported
Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his
really eloquent speech at Hacker‘s Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as
a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one
thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely,
sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for
some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a
systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night
by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and
following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also
kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the
dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.
3.
In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained wide notice
amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old
cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to
have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or
made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing,
for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have
come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of
information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.
But Curwen‘s feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary,
they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled
by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy
had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly
decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were
rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards,
were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how
thorough the old merchant‘s change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of
espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a
vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and
subjected Curwen‘s affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before.
Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchant‘s vessels had been taken for granted
on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the
provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion
were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous
commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he
saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it
was not merely His Majesty‘s armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid.
Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes,
who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just
north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm,
where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits
for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of
slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about
the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from
the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as
far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of
considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwen‘s sailors would then deposit this
cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it in the
same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted
almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and
disturbingly suggestive of coffins.
Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each night for long
periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a
footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled
road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding
his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar
Smith to continue the survey during his absences; and between them the two could have set
in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew
the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible.
Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking any action. What they did learn
must have been startling indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his
regret at Weeden‘s later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries is
what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary, and what other diarists and
letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made—and
according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a
scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.
It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels
and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his
wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century
with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a
lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear
of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been
accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere
mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or
invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they
ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury,
rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of
protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping
accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed
that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those
captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before
despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as
belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of
catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious
prisoners.
Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French,
and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did,
however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence
families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were
historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for
example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black
Prince‘s massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought
to know. Curwen asked the prisoner—if prisoner it were—whether the order to slay was given
because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the
Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three
Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for
there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.
None of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were always
heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, a shadow was seen
on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a
show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in Hacker‘s Hall, when a man from Germantown,
Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a ―View of the Famous
City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal
Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise the Sufferings of Our Saviour from the Garden
of Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be
seen by the Curious.‖ It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the
window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old
Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more conversations were
ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his
field of action to regions below.
That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and
groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in
places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear,
where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an
arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns
within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was
unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by
bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse
uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the
steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were
rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep
gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such
things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were
common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.
It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if
anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the
Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport
during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an
increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majesty‘s armed
schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early
morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound
according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband
material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of
Egyptian mummies, consigned to ―Sailor A. B. C.‖, who would come to remove his goods in a
lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not
to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-
contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on
the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinson‘s recommendation by freeing the ship
but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been
seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston.
This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many
who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the
sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being
common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take
much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have
been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took
care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in
mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping
just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt
whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning
Curwen and his monstrous labours.
The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept
careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away,
and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual
subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of
Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the
placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic
bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of
things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over
the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions
abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the
fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot
down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had
greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith—for
Weeden was just then at sea—in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely
enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace
of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of
mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging,
but was deterred by lack of success—or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting
to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been
ashore at the time.
4.
By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his
discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to
refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first
confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew
him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in
the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabin‘s
Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it
could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else
in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed
only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the
conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He
would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and
prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they
might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter
that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd
must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition
of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen
hither.
The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the
late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President
of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new
King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-
Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at
Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all
four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised
local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen,
whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwen‘s odd
purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and
energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if
favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them
would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony,
Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.
The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he
found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of
Weeden‘s tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret
and coördinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare
of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group
of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures.
Weeden‘s notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and
Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the
whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear a grim
determination which Capt. Whipple‘s bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would
not notify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden
powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could
safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the sinister
creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to
another place. The times were lawless, and men who had flouted the King‘s revenue forces
for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be
surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given
one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks
and imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If something
graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with
him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not be told
how it came about.
While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so
terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the
middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the
river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window;
and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the
badly cleared space in front of the Turk‘s Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance,
but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of
men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded
their search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on
the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched
out beside Abbott‘s distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless
speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered,
for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of
memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in
those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity—
and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.
Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the night before, set
out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge whence the sound had come. He
had a curious expectancy, and was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled
district where the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious
tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and
the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given
up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory
detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen,
as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less
confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen,
to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse,
and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man
seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture
impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this body‘s likeness to
the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a
supercargo in Curwen‘s employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green
was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite
Herrenden‘s Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.
Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwen‘s
mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one
Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the coöperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied
and preserved in the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as
follows:
―I delight that you continue in ye Gett‘g at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not
think better was done at Mr. Hutchinson‘s in Salem-Village. Certainely, there was
Noth‘g butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. rais‘d upp from What he cou‘d
gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of Any
Thing miss‘g, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speak‘g or yr
Copy‘g. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and
owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you
recommende. But I wou‘d have you Observe what was tolde to us aboute tak‘g
Care whom to calle up, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of

againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any
that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest
Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to
Answer, and shall commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your

not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan
by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye
Blacke Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman Wall, and
will be oblig‘d for ye Lend‘g of ye MS. you speak of.‖
Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, especially for the
following passage:
―I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr Vessels,
but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke of, I
require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. You
inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you
can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to
take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peter‘s, St. Paul‘s, St. Mary‘s, or
Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what Imperfections were in
the one I rais‘d up October last, and how many live Specimens you were forc‘d to
imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by
you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddle‘s
Wharf.‖
A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet. In the
Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily
copied; and authorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or
Abyssinian, although they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever
delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded
shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The Pennsylvania
Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the
presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the
air, and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old
privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of
Weeden‘s disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which
would leave no trace of Joseph Curwen‘s noxious mysteries.
Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; for he was
now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen at all hours in the town
and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which
he had latterly sought to combat the town‘s prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the
Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in
the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event
which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the
executive leader of the select group bent on Curwen‘s extirpation, and had informed the
Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he deemed needful because of the
impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid; and he explained his course by saying that
Curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of
every Providence shipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether
the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not
certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer
ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of
regularly reporting every incident which took place there.
5.
The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as suggested by
the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious
citizens. According to the Smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday,
April 12th, 1771, in the great room of Thurston‘s Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on
Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the
leader John Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments,
President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was
noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring
brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John
Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These
chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great
room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with
the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty
was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm.
About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach
in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to
know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment
later, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared;
and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-
pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with the
party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the
leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr.
Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent
from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began
the long march without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock
behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond
Elder Snow‘s church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at Providence lying
outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and gables rose dark and shapely, and salt
breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the
great hill across the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished
College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old
town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a
blasphemy was about to be wiped out.
An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the Fenner
farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He had reached his farm
over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky, but
there were no lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this
news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they
had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now
ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to
strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for
Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of twenty men
under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and
demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to
close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be
led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third
to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a
circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.
The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then
waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two
whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of
the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals
in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending
whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal
warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts
would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing
equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt.
Whipple‘s belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into
consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and
shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at
the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistle‘s range; hence would require a special
messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the
river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building.
Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipple‘s party which was to storm the
farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had
joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river party‘s readiness. The leader would then deliver
the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous
attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse;
one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to
subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.
Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary an uneventful
march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant
sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a
powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he
caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and
thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard
messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told
the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the
night‘s doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the
messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though
he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained
in his soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old
companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained
something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or felt something which
was not for human creatures, and could not forget it. From them there was never any gossip,
for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that
single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their
own lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smith‘s
diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth
from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars.
Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner correspondence
which he found in New London, where he knew another branch of the family had lived. It
seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had
watched the departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the
Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had
been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another
moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, there had
come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the
correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters ―Waaaahrrrrr—
R’waaahrrr”. This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey,
and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. It was later
repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with
a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs
began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the
candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke
Fenner‘s father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the
others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less
piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily
plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity
and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.
Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought to lie, and the
human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and
the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human
origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched
in frenzy: ―Almighty, protect thy lamb!‖ Then there were more shots, and the second flaming
thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time
little Arthur Fenner, Luke‘s brother, exclaimed that he saw ‗a red fog‘ going up to the stars
from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke
admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the
same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.
Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable
stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the
shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of
the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear
beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no
hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and
windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ,
but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an
unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac
intonations: ―DEESMEES–JESHET–BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA–ENITEMOSS‖. Not till the
year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but
Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the
ultimate horror among black magic‘s incantations.
An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign
wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added
odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was
protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate,
though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward
the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark
madness wrenched from scores of human throats—a yell which came strong and clear
despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all
things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames appeared and
no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day.
Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating
their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg of rum, for which they paid
very well indeed. One of them told the family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and
that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed,
the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so
that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to
destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative,
whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion.
Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for
ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was known to his
grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week
after the death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion
that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither
thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read
about.
6.
Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word
concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside
the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders
destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed,
but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement
that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the
numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr.
Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour
clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt.
Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the
bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced.
Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they
were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle
introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning
was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories
in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is
perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led
the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in
the blotting out of unwholesome images.
There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design,
obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she was told her husband‘s body
lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to
give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwen‘s end, and Charles
Ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest
thread—a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Orne‘s confiscated letter to Curwen,
as partly copied in Ezra Weeden‘s handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of
Smith‘s descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion
after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more
probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had
managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The
underlined passage is merely this:
―I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which
I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your
Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall
not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.”
In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man
might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well have wondered whether
any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen.
The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals
was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so
thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the
true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough
rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter
change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from
the slate slab above Joseph Curwen‘s grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably
extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end
of the accused sorcerer.
From that time on the obliteration of Curwen‘s memory became increasingly rigid, extending
at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be
compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wilde‘s name for a decade after his
disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsany‘s tale,
whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been.
Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and
resided with her father in Power‘s Lane till her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned
by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with
unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800
even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on
the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite
image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.
Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to
himself, ―Pox on that ———, but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. ‘Twas as
though the damn‘d ——— had some‘at up his sleeve. For half a crown I‘d burn his ———
house.‖
III. A Search and an Evocation
1.
Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen.
That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not
to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became
something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwen‘s blood. No spirited and imaginative
genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection
of Curwen data.
In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman
hesitates to date the youth‘s madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked
freely with his family—though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like
Curwen—and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to
private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his
object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old
diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really
had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly
tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.
When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah
Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwen‘s early activities and connexions there,
which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known
to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and
clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable
amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers,
seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662–3; and that he had run
away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with
the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that
time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he
had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from
England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much
local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the
hills at night.
Curwen‘s only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one
Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common,
and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward
the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard
there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows
were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead
persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he
disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that
time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of.
Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite
attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-
styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of
documents in Simon Orne‘s known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till
1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others
brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.
Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex
Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless
commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more
provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft
trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and
Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that ‗fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete
in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinson‘s house‘, and one Amity How declared at a session of
August 8th before Judge Gedney that ‗Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt
ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C.,
Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.‘ Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinson‘s
uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his
handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this
manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to
him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and
there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before
October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.
But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to
prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the
text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the
same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in
Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands
except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy
most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a
few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams
in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one
extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the
Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwen‘s.
This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to
which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not
much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of
one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as ―Simon‖, but a line
(whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwen‘s Providence
home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The
discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761
on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to
Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers‘ Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares
from his own home on the great hill‘s higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family
much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To
find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own
family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place
immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be
some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of
curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to—Job 14, 14—was the familiar verse, ―If a man
die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.‖
2.
Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday
in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with
age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house
of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and
artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It
had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very
close to the sinister matters of his quest.
The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about
the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the
outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn
overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine
wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up
altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had
somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had
housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had
been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.
From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the
Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved
unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data
elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult
old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it
brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid,
and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the
Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have
given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second
search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient
features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.
Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room
sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid
especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly
excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-
floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of
paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to
have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an
oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage
which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but
just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with
an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College
Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and
chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and
were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.
As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing
interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun
at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come
out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with
dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings,
seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond.
When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a
thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist.
Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at
the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick
which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate
scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the
bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the
countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.
Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once
determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The
resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it
could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had
found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Ward‘s resemblance to her ancestor
was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial
characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the
discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it
home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in
its
numa festa.
– Michael.
– Onde?
Ela apontou na direção da cama.
– Pegue seus sapatos.
Ela passou por ele, saindo da cozinha, abaixando-se
automaticamente para pegar sua lingerie no
carpete. Seus sapatos estavam ao lado do sofá.Ele a seguiu e a observou colocar os sapatos. Continuava
segurando a arma. Com a outra mão,
pegou a jaqueta de couro de Michael do sofá e jogou na
direção dela. – Vista isso – disse. Ela vestiu e enfiou a
lingerie num dos bolsos.
Ele pegou a capa de chuva branca e rasgada, dobrou-a e
colocou dentro do bolso do casaco dele.
Michael estava roncando. Talvez acordasse logo para ver
a gravação outra vez. Com o
equipamento que tinha, na verdade não precisava de
ninguém lá.
No corredor, observou Prior voltar a trancar a porta, com
uma caixa cinza. A arma tinha desaparecido, mas não viu
quando a guardou. A caixa tinha um pedaço de cabo
vermelho saindo para
fora e uma chave magnética de aparência comum na
ponta.
Estava frio na rua. Ele a levou até a esquina e abriu a
porta de um pequeno veículo branco de
três rodas. Ela entrou. Ele se sentou no lado do motorista
e tirou as luvas. Deu partida no carro; ela ficou olhando
uma nuvem refletida na fachada espelhada de cobre de
uma torre.
– Ele vai pensar que roubei isso – disse ela, olhando para
a jaqueta.
Então, o wiz disparou uma última cartada, uma cascata
despedaçada de sinapses neuronais: Cleveland na chuvae uma sensação boa que teve uma vez, caminhando.

FILAMENTO NOS ESTRATOS
Sou seu público ideal, Hans – enquanto a gravação
recomeçava pela segunda vez. Como encontrar um
espectador mais atento? E você realmente a capturou,
Hans: eu sei porque sonho as memórias dela. Vejo como
chegou perto.
***
Sim, você os capturou. A viagem para fora, a construção
de muros, a longa espiral interior.
Gostavam de muros, não? O labirinto de sangue, de
família. O dédalo pendurado sobre o vácuo, dizendo, Nós
somos aquilo dentro, aquilo fora é outro, aqui para
sempre residiremos. E a escuridão estava lá, desde o
começo... Você a encontrou repetidamente nos olhos de
Marie-France, imobilizou-a num zoom lento contra as
órbitas sombreadas do crânio. Ela não demorou para
impedir que sua imagem fosse gravada. Você trabalhou
com o que tinha. Ajustou a imagem dela, girou-a através
de
planos de luz, planos de sombra, modelos gerados,
mapeou seu crânio em redes de neon. Usou programas
especiais para envelhecer as imagens, de acordo com
modelos estatísticos, sistemas de animação fizeram viver
sua Marie-France madura. Você reduziu a imagem dela a
um vasto, porém finito, número de pontos e misturou-os,deixando que novas formas surgissem e escolhendo
aquelas
que pareciam lhe dizer algo... Então passou para os
outros, para Ashpool e a filha cujo rosto emoldura seu
trabalho, primeira e última imagem.
***
A segunda exibição solidificou a história da família para
Angie, permitindo que reunisse os fragmentos de Becker
numa linha do tempo que começava com casamento de
Tessier e Ashpool, uma
união comentada, na época, principalmente na mídia
financeira e corporativa. Cada um era herdeiro de mais
do que um pequeno império: Tessier tinha uma fortuna
de família, fundada sobre nove patentes básicas em
bioquímica aplicada e Ashpool detinha uma enorme firma
de engenharia, sediada em Melbourne, que levava o
nome de seu pai. Era um casamento tanto quanto uma
fusão, para os jornalistas, embora a entidade corporativa
resultante fosse vista por muitos como inepta, uma
quimera com duas cabeças radicalmente desiguais.
Mas então era possível ver, nas fotografias de Ashpool, o
tédio desaparecendo, enquanto surgia,
em seu lugar, uma completa certeza de propósito. O
efeito era pouco lisonjeiro – na verdade, era
amedrontador: o rosto duro e lindo tornava-se mais
endurecido, cruel em sua intenção.
Um ano após seu casamento com Marie-France Tessier,
Ashpool tinha se livrado de 90% das ações de sua firma,
tendo reinvestido o dinheiro em propriedades orbitais e
equipamentos para transporte espacial. Os frutos daunião biológica, duas crianças, irmão e irmã, tinham sido
trazidos ao mundo por barrigas de aluguel na villa de sua
mãe em Biarritz.
Os Tessier-Ashpool ascenderam para o arquipélago de
alta órbita e encontraram a eclíptica esparsamente
demarcada por estações militares e as primeiras fábricas
autômatas dos cartéis. Então começaram a construir.
Suas riquezas combinadas, inicialmente, mal se
igualavam ao investimento da Ono-Sendai em um único
módulo de processos da operação orbital de
semicondutores daquela multinacional, mas Marie-France
demonstrou um inesperado tino para negócios, criando
um paraíso
de dados altamente lucrativo que atendia às
necessidades de setores de reputação dúbia da
comunidade bancária internacional. Isso, por sua vez,
criava conexões com os bancos em si, e seus clientes.
Ashpool fazia vultosos empréstimos e o muro de concreto
lunar que se tornaria Freeside cresceu e curvou-se,
enclausurando seus criadores.
Quando veio a guerra, os Tessier-Ashpool estavam atrás
daquele muro. Assistiram Bonn piscar
e sumir, depois Belgrado. A construção do fuso continuou
com poucas interrupções sem importância
durante aquelas três semanas; mais tarde, durante a
década caótica e atordoada que se seguiu, por vezes
ficou mais difícil.
As crianças, Jean e Jane, estavam com eles agora, a villa
em Biarritz tendo sido vendida para financiar a
construção do depósito criogênico para a sua casa, a
Villa Straylight. Os primeiros ocupantes do cofre foramdez pares de embriões congelados, 2Jean e 2Jane, 3Jean
e 3Jane... Havia inúmeras leis proibindo ou, pelo menos,
controlando a replicação artificial de material genético de
um indivíduo, mas havia também inúmeras questões de
jurisdição...
***
Ela congelou o replay e pediu que a casa voltasse à
sequência anterior. Fotografias de outra unidade de
armazenamento criogênico construída pelos fabricantes
suíços do cofre da Tessier-Ashpool. A suposição de
similaridade de Becker fora correta, ela sabia: aquelas
portas circulares de vidro negro, ornamentadas por
bordas cromadas, eram imagens centrais da memória da
outra, potentes e totêmicas.
As imagens avançaram novamente, para a construção de
estruturas no ambiente de gravidade zero na superfície
interna do fuso, instalação de um sistema de energia
solar Lado-Acheson, a implementação de atmosfera e
gravidade rotacional... Becker havia se deparado com
uma
enormidade de material, horas de documentação
detalhada e de alta qualidade. Sua resposta foi uma
montagem selvagem e entrecortada que rasgava o
lirismo superficial do material original, isolando os rostos
tensos e exaustos dos operários em meio ao frenesi de
maquinário, uma colmeia. Os jardins de Freeside
cresceram e floresceram num estremecer em fast-
forward de madrugadas gravadas e pôres do sol
sintéticos; uma terra exuberante e lacrada, ornada com
piscinas turquesa.Tessier e Ashpool emergiram para a cerimônia de
inauguração, saindo de Straylight, sua área privada
escondida
na
ponta
da
espiral,
notadamente
desinteressados, enquanto inspecionavam o país que
haviam construído. Aqui, Becker diminui o ritmo e retoma
a sua análise obsessiva. Esta seria a última vez em que
Marie-France encarava uma câmera; Becker explorou os
planos de seu rosto numa
fuga torturada e prolongada, o movimento das imagens
em refinado contraponto com a linha sinuosa
de feedback que curvava e açoitava em meio aos
inconstantes níveis de estática de sua trilha sonora.

Angie pediu nova pausa, levantou-se da cama, foi para a
janela. Sentiu uma elevação, um sentimento inesperado
de força e unidade interna. Tinha se sentido deste modo
sete anos antes, em Nova Jersey, quando descobriu que
outros conheciam aqueles que apareciam em seus
sonhos, e os denominavam loa, Cavaleiros Divinos,
nomeavam-nos e convocavam-nos e negociavam com
eles para obter seus favores.
Mesmo na época, havia confusões. Bobby argumentou
que Linglessou, que cavalgava Beauvoir
no oumphor, e o Linglessou da matrix eram entidades
separadas, se é que o primeiro fosse mesmo
uma entidade. – Eles têm feito isso por dez mil anos –
dissera ele –, dançar e endoidar, mas essas coisas no
ciberespaço só passaram a existir nos últimos sete, oito
anos. – Bobby acreditava nos antigos cowboys, aquelespara quem pagava drinques no Gentlemen Loser sempre
que a carreira de
Angie o levava para o Sprawl, aqueles que insistiam que
os loa eram recém-chegados. Os antigos cowboys se
lembravam de um tempo em que coragem e talento
eram os únicos fatores decisivos na
carreira de um artista de console, ainda que Beauvoir
tivesse respondido que era necessário exatamente o
mesmo para lidar com os loa.
– Mas eles vêm até mim – rebateu ela. – Não preciso de
um console.
– É o que você tem dentro da sua cabeça. O que o seu
pai fez...
Bobby tinha dito a ela que havia um consenso geral,
entre os cowboys mais velhos, de que houve um dia em
que as coisas mudaram, embora ninguém concordasse
sobre como e quando isso
havia ocorrido.
Quando Isso Mudou, era como se referiam àquilo, e
Bobby tinha levado para o Loser uma Angie disfarçada
para ouvi-los, seguida por ansiosos seguranças da Net
que não puderam cruzar a porta. O fato de terem
barrado os seguranças havia impressionado Angie muito
mais do que a conversa, na época. O Gentleman Loser
tinha se tornado um bar de cowboys desde a guerra que
vira
nascer a nova tecnologia, e não havia, em todo o Sprawl,
um ambiente criminoso mais exclusivo –ainda que, quando Angie o visitou, essa exclusividade já
houvesse há muito incluído um vago pressuposto de que
os frequentadores assíduos estariam aposentados. Os
garotos novos não vinham
mais fazer negócios no Loser, mas alguns vinham
escutar.
Agora, no quarto da casa em Malibu, Angie lembrou-se
deles contando suas histórias de Quando Isso Mudou,
consciente de que uma parte dela estava tentando
combinar aquelas memórias,
aquelas histórias, com sua própria história e a da Tessier-
Ashpool.
***
3Jane era o filamento, Tessier-Ashpool os estratos, sua
data de nascimento oficialmente registrada como a
mesma
de
seus
dezenove
irmãos
clones.
O
“interrogatório” de Becker tornou-se
ainda mais acirrado quando 3Jane veio ao mundo em
outro útero de aluguel, parto de cesariana na
sala de cirurgia de Straylight. Os críticos concordaram:
3Jane era o estopim da obra de Becker. Após o
nascimento de 3Jane, o foco do documentário mudava
sutilmente, exibindo uma nova intensidade,
um crescimento da obsessão – um sentido, como mais de
um crítico tinha afirmado, de pecado.
3Jane tornou-se o foco, uma costura de ouro perverso no
granito da família. Não, pensou Angie, prata, pálida e
iluminada pela lua. Examinando a fotografia, tirada porum turista chinês, de 3Jane e suas duas irmãs à beira da
piscina de um hotel em Freeside, Becker volta
repetidamente aos olhos de 3Jane, suas clavículas
afundadas, a fragilidade de seus pulsos. Fisicamente, as
irmãs eram idênticas, mas ainda assim alguma coisa
informa 3Jane, e a busca de Becker pela natureza desta
informação se torna o impulso central do trabalho.
Freeside prospera à medida que o arquipélago se
expande. Nodo bancário, bordel, paraíso de dados,
território neutro para corporações em guerra, a espiral
passa a desempenhar um papel cada vez mais complexo
na história da alta órbita, enquanto a Tessier-Ashpool S.A.
retrocede para trás de mais um muro, desta vez
composto por corporações subsidiárias. O nome de
Marie-France emerge
brevemente, em conexão com um julgamento de patente
em Genebra, relacionado a certos avanços
no campo da inteligência artificial, e o gigantesco
financiamento da Tessier-Ashpool para pesquisas nessa
área é revelado pela primeira vez. Novamente, a família
demonstra sua habilidade peculiar para desaparecer de
vista, ingressando num novo período de obscuridade, o
qual só terminaria com a morte de Marie-France.
Houve rumores persistentes sobre assassinato, mas
qualquer tentativa de investigação seria tragada pela
riqueza e o isolamento da família, o alcance peculiar e a
complexidade de suas conexões políticas e financeiras.
Angie, assistindo a Becker pela segunda vez, soube a
identidade do assassino de Marie-France
Tessier.***
De madrugada, fez café na cozinha escura e sentou-se
para observar a linha clara das ondas.
– Continuidade.
– Olá, Angie.
– Você sabe como encontrar Hans Becker?
– Tenho o número do agente dele em Paris.
– Ele fez alguma coisa desde Antártica?
– Não que eu saiba.
– Quanto tempo faz isso?
– Cinco anos.
– Obrigada.
– De nada, Angie.
– Tchau.
– Tchau, Angie.
Será que Becker havia presumido que 3Jane
responsável pela morte de Ashpool? Ele parecia
sugerir isso, de um jeito oblíquo.
– Continuidade.
– Olá, Angie.
foi– O folclore dos jóqueis de console, Continuidade. O que
você sabe sobre isso? – E o que Swift vai depreender
disso tudo? , perguntou-se.
– O que você gostaria de saber, Angie?
– “Quando Isso Mudou”...
– A forma mítica é geralmente encontrada em um de dois
modos. Um modo pressupõe que a matrix do ciberespaço
é habitada, ou talvez visitada, por entidades cujas
características correspondem à forma mítica de um
“povo oculto”. O outro envolve hipóteses de onisciência,
onipotência e incompreensibilidade de parte da própria
matrix.
– Que a matrix é Deus?
– É um modo de dizer, embora fosse mais preciso, em
termos da forma mítica, dizer que a matrix tem um Deus,
já que a onipotência e onisciência deste ser
supostamente se limitam à matrix.
– Se ele tem limites, não é onipotente.
– Exatamente. Note que a forma mítica não credita ao ser
a imortalidade, como seria de esperar,
habitualmente, no caso de sistemas de crenças baseadas
num ser supremo, pelo menos no que diz respeito à sua
cultura em particular. O ciberespaço existe, até onde
podemos dizer que exista, em virtude da atividade
humana.
– Como você.
– Sim.Vagou pela sala, onde as cadeiras Luís xvi pareciam
esqueletos na luz cinzenta, suas pernas esculpidas como
ossos dourados.
– Se existisse tal ser – disse ela – você seria parte dele,
não seria?
– Sim.
– Você saberia?
– Não necessariamente.
– Você sabe?
– Não.
– Você descarta tal possibilidade?
– Não.
– Você acha esta conversa estranha, Continuidade? – Seu
rosto estava úmido com lágrimas, embora não as tivesse
sentido surgir.
– Não.
– E como é que as histórias sobre... – hesitou, quase
dizendo os loa –, sobre coisas na matrix,
como elas se encaixam nesta ideia de ser supremo?
– Não se encaixam. Ambas são variantes de “Quando
Isso Mudou”. Ambas têm origem muito recente.
– Quantos?
– Aproximadamente quinze anos.17
JUMP CITY
Acordou com a palma fria de Sally pressionando a sua
boca, a outra mão gesticulando, pedindo
silêncio.
As pequenas luzes estavam ligadas, aquelas afixadas aos
painéis do espelho salpicado de dourado. Uma de suas
malas estava aberta, sobre a cama gigante, com uma
pequena pilha de roupas
bem arrumadas ao seu lado.
Sally tocou seu dedo indicador nos lábios fechados,
depois fez um gesto em direção à mala e às
roupas.
Kumiko deslizou para fora do edredom e enfiou um
suéter, para se proteger do frio. Olhou para
Sally novamente e pensou em dizer alguma coisa. Não
importava o que fosse aquilo, pensou, apenas
uma palavra faria com que Petal viesse. Estava vestida
do mesmo jeito como Kumiko a tinha visto na última vez,
usando a jaqueta de pelica, uma manta xadrez amarrada
debaixo do queixo. Repetiu o gesto: faça as malas.
Kumiko vestiu-se apressadamente, depois começou a
colocar as roupas na mala. Sally movia-se
impaciente e silenciosamente pelo quarto, abrindo
gavetas, fechando-as. Encontrou o passaporte de
Kumiko, um pedaço de plástico preto ornamentado comum crisântemo dourado, e pendurou-o ao redor do
pescoço de Kumiko com seu cordão de nylon preto.
Sumiu dentro do cubículo embutido e
apareceu com a frasqueira de toalete de Kumiko.
Enquanto Kumiko fechava a mala, o telefone de marfim
começou a tocar.
Sally ignorou-o, pegou a mala da cama, abriu a porta,
puxou Kumiko pela mão e levou-a para o
corredor escuro. Soltando a mão, Sally fechou a porta
atrás delas, abafando o som do telefone e deixando-as
em total escuridão. Kumiko deixou-se guiar até o
elevador – sabia que era isso pelo cheiro de óleo e de
cera para madeira, o ruído do portão de metal.
Depois desceram.
Petal estava esperando por elas no vestíbulo branco e
claro, envolto num enorme robe de flanela. Estava
usando suas pantufas gastas; suas pernas, abaixo da
barra do robe, eram muito brancas. Segurava uma arma
nas mãos, pequena e grossa, de um preto opaco. – Mas
que diabos... –
disse ele, suavemente, quando as viu – O que está
acontecendo?
– Ela vai comigo – disse Sally.
– Isto – disse Petal, lentamente – é absolutamente
impossível.
– Kumi – disse Sally, sua mãos nas costas de Kumiko,
guiando-a para fora do elevador –, há umcarro esperando.
– Você não pode fazer isso – disse Petal, mas Kumiko
sentiu sua confusão, incerteza.
– Então me dá um tiro, Petal.
Petal baixou a arma. – É Swain quem vai atirar em mim,
se te deixar sair.
– Se ele estivesse aqui, estaria com o mesmo problema,
não é?
– Por favor – disse Petal –, não.
– Ela estará bem. Não se preocupe. Abra a porta.
– Sally – disse Kumiko –, para onde estamos indo?
– Para o Sprawl.
***
E acordou novamente, aconchegada sob a jaqueta de
pelica de Sally, com a vibração suave do
voo supersônico. Lembrou-se do enorme carro baixo,
esperando por elas na alameda; holofotes saltando da
fachada das casas de Swain, enquanto ela e Sally se
aproximavam do asfalto; o rosto suado de Tick através
de uma das janelas do carro; Sally abrindo uma porta,
conduzindo-a
para
dentro;
Tick
praguejando
continuamente em voz baixa, ao acelerar o carro; pneus
gritando quando
virou rápido demais na estrada de Kensington Park; Sally
dizendo que fosse mais devagar, que deixasse o carro
dirigir.E, lá no carro, lembrou-se de ter recolocado a unidade
Maas-Neotek no esconderijo, atrás do busto de mármore
– Colin deixado para trás com toda a sua pose de
espertalhão de gravura, os cotovelos de sua jaqueta
desgastados como as pantufas de Petal – nada mais do
que era, um fantasma.
– Quarenta minutos – disse Sally, da poltrona ao seu lado
no avião. – Que bom que você dormiu.
Vão trazer o café da manhã. Você se lembra do nome no
seu passaporte? Ótimo. Agora, não me pergunte nada
até que eu tome um pouco de café, ok?
***
Kumiko conhecia o Sprawl de milhares de stims; a
fascinação com a vasta concentração urbana
era um traço comum na cultura popular japonesa.
Ela tinha alguns conceitos preconcebidos da Inglaterra
quando chegou lá: imagens vagas de várias construções
famosas, impressões desfocadas de uma sociedade que
a sua própria via como pitoresca e estagnada. (Nas
histórias de sua mãe, a princesa-bailarina descobria que
os ingleses, embora a admirassem, não poderiam pagar
para que dançasse.) Londres, até então, tinha sido o
oposto de suas expectativas, com sua energia, sua
evidente riqueza, uma agitação similar à de Ginza em
suas grandes ruas de comércio.
Também tinha muitas ideias preconcebidas sobre o
Sprawl, a maior parte das quais foi estilhaçada poucas
horas após a chegada.Mas, enquanto esperava ao lado de Sally na fila com
outros passageiros, numa vasta sala de alfândega, com
um teto alto, cujas colunas erguiam-se até perderem-se
na escuridão, uma escuridão quebrada em alguns pontos
por globos de luz pálida – globos circundados, embora
fosse inverno, por nuvens de insetos, como se o prédio
possuísse seu próprio clima – era o Sprawl do stim que
imaginava, o pano de fundo elétrico e sensual das vidas
agitadas de Angela Mitchell e Robin Lanier.
Cruzando a alfândega – que consistia, apesar da
interminável espera na fila, em passar seu passaporte
por uma ranhura de metal com aparência oleosa – e
entrando em um frenético salão de concreto, onde
carrinhos de bagagem autômatos avançavam com
dificuldade entre a multidão que corria de um lado para
outro e lutava por um transporte terrestre.
Alguém pegou sua mala. Inclinou-se e tirou-a de suas
mãos com uma facilidade e confiança que
sugeriam que estava lá para isso, que era um funcionário
executando uma tarefa banal, como as moças fazendo
mesuras de boas-vindas nas portas das lojas de
departamento em Tóquio. E Sally deu
um chute nele. Chutou-o atrás dos joelhos, girando
graciosamente, como as lutadoras de boxe tailandês na
sala de bilhar de Swain, agarrando a mala antes que a
parte de trás da cabeça do homem e o concreto
manchado se encontrassem com um estalo audível.
Em seguida, Sally puxava-a, a multidão tinha se fechado
sobre a figura caída no chão e a violência casual e
repentina poderia ter sido um sonho, exceto que Sallyestava sorrindo pela primeira vez desde que partiram de
Londres.
Sentindo-se inteiramente deslocada agora,
observava enquanto Sally fazia uma pesquisa
Kumiko
sobre os veículos disponíveis, subornando rapidamente
um despachante uniformizado, intimidando outros três
possíveis passageiros e conduzindo Kumiko para dentro
de um hovercraft de chassis denteado, laterais
reforçadas, pintado com faixas diagonais amarelas e
pretas. O compartimento de passageiros era espartano e
tinha uma aparência profundamente desconfortável. O
motorista, se é que havia algum, estava invisível atrás da
blindagem em plástico, bastante rabiscada. Uma
microcâmera de vídeo podia ser vista entre a blindagem
e o teto, e alguém havia desenhado uma imagem
pornográfica lá: o torso de um homem, a câmera era seu
pênis. Quando Sally entrou e bateu a porta, um alto-
falante rosnou alguma coisa que Kumiko deduziu ser um
dialeto do inglês.
– Manhattan – disse Sally. Pegou um maço de dinheiro de
papel no bolso de sua jaqueta e sacudiu-o em frente à
câmera.
O alto-falante fez barulhos interrogativos.
– Midtown. Eu lhe digo onde quando chegarmos lá.
O colchão de ar do táxi inflou-se, a luz no compartimento
do passageiro se apagou e elas partiram.

TEMPO EM CANAEle estava no loft de Gentry. Estava observando Cherry
fazer aquelas coisas de enfermeira em
Gentry. Cherry olhou para ele, de onde estava sentada,
na ponta da cama de Gentry. – Como está, Slick?
– Bem... Estou bem.
– Lembra de eu ter perguntado antes?
***
Ele estava olhando para baixo, para o rosto do homem
que Kid Afrika chamava de Conde.
Cherry estava ajustando alguma coisa na superestrutura
da maca, uma bolsa de fluido cor de aveia.
– Como se sente, Slick?
– Me sinto bem.
– Você não está bem. Você continua es...
***
Ele estava sentado no chão do loft de Gentry. Seu rosto
estava úmido. Cherry estava ajoelhada
ao seu lado, perto, as mãos dela em seus ombros.
– Você esteve em cana?
Ele concordou com a cabeça.
– Unidade quimiopenal?
– Sim...– Korsakovs induzidos?
Ele…
***
– Episódios? – Cherry perguntou. Ele estava sentado no
chão do loft de Gentry. Onde estava Gentry? – Você tem
episódios como este? A memória de curto prazo some?
Como ela sabia? Onde estava Gentry?
– O que desencadeia?
***
– O que desencadeia a síndrome, Slick? O que joga você
no tempo-de-prisão? – Ele estava sentado no chão do loft
de Gentry e Cherry estava praticamente sobre ele.
– Estresse – respondeu, se perguntando como ela sabia
daquelas coisas. – Onde está o Gentry?
– Eu o coloquei na cama.
– Por quê?
– Ele saiu do ar. Quando viu aquela coisa...
– Que coisa?
***
Cherry estava pressionando um derma rosa contra o
pulso dele. – Um tranquilizante forte –
disse ela. – Talvez tire você dessa...– Tirar do quê?
Ela suspirou. – Não importa.
Ele acordou na cama com Cherry Chesterfield. Estava
totalmente vestido, tudo menos a sua jaqueta e as botas.
A ponta de seu pênis ereto estava presa atrás da fivela
de seu cinto, pressionada contra o jeans quente contra o
traseiro de Cherry.
– Nem pense nisso.
A luz de inverno, através da janela remendada, e seu
hálito branco quando falava. – O que aconteceu? – Por
que estava tão frio no quarto? Ele se lembrava do grito
de Gentry quando a coisa deu um bote na direção dele...
Sentou-se, rápido.
– Calma – disse ela, virando-se. – Deite novamente. Não
sei o que é preciso para disparar a coisa...
– O que você quer dizer?
– Deite de novo. Fique embaixo das cobertas. Quer
congelar?
Fez o que ela mandou. – Você esteve na prisão, certo?
Numa unidade quimiopenal?
– Sim... Como você sabe?
– Você me contou. Noite passada. Contou que o estresse
pode desencadear um flashback. Então
foi isso que aconteceu. A coisa tentou pegar o seu amigo,
você pulou em direção ao interruptor, desligou aquela
mesa. Ele caiu, sofreu um corte na cabeça. Estavacuidando dele quando percebi que você ficou estranho.
Acabei concluindo que você só tinha uma memória
consecutiva durante uns cinco minutos a cada vez.
Acontece em casos de choque, às vezes, ou concussão...
– Onde está ele? Gentry.
– Está na cama, lá no canto dele, sedado. Do jeito que
estava, achei que um dia de sono seria bom. De qualquer
modo, isso nos livra dele por um tempo.
Slick fechou os olhos e viu a coisa cinza de novo, a coisa
que tinha saltado em direção a Gentry.
Tinha o formato de um homem, ou algo assim, ou um
primata. Nada parecido como a figura intricada que o
equipamento de Gentry gerava em sua busca pela
Forma.
– Acho que estamos sem energia – disse Cherry. – A luz
apagou há umas seis horas.
Ele abriu os olhos. O frio. Gentry não tinha feito seus
passes no console. Grunhiu.
***
Deixou Cherry fazendo café no fogão de butano e saiu
para procurar Little Bird. Encontrou-o
pelo cheiro de fumaça. Little Bird tinha feito fogo num
latão e dormiu ao lado dele, enrolado como um cachorro.
– Ei – disse Slick, sacudindo o garoto com sua bota –,
levanta. Temos problemas.
– A merda da energia acabou – murmurou, sentando-se
num saco de dormir cheio de graxa, manchado com amesma cor do chão da Fábrica.
– Eu percebi. Esse é o problema número um. O número
dois é que precisamos de um caminhão
ou de um hovercraft ou algo assim. Temos que tirar
aquele cara daqui. Está dando confusão com o
Gentry.
– Mas o Gentry é o único que pode consertar a força –
Little Bird levantou-se, tremendo de frio.
– Gentry está dormindo. Quem tem um caminhão?
– Marvie e os outros – disse Little Bird, e começou a
tossir.
– Pegue a moto de Gentry, vai e traz de volta no
caminhão. Agora.
Little Bird se recuperou do ataque de tosse. – É sério?
– Você sabe como andar na moto, não é?
– Sim, mas o Gentry, o cara vai ficar...
– Deixa que eu cuido disso. Você sabe onde fica
guardada a chave reserva?
– Sei, claro – disse Little Bird, timidamente. – Mas... –
arriscou – e se Marvie e os outros não
quiserem me emprestar o caminhão?
– Dá isso pra eles – disse Slick, tirando o ziploc cheio de
drogas do bolso de sua jaqueta. Cherry tinha pegado o
pacote depois de fazer o curativo na cabeça de Gentry. –Mas dá tudo pra eles, entendeu? Porque vou perguntar
depois.
***
O bíper de Cherry disparou enquanto estavam tomando
café na sala de Slick, aconchegados um
no outro, no canto da cama. Ele estava contando tudo o
que sabia sobre o Korsakov, porque ela tinha perguntado.
Nunca havia falado muito a respeito daquilo com
ninguém e, na verdade, era curioso como ele sabia
pouco sobre o assunto. Contou a ela sobre os flashbacks
anteriores, depois tentou explicar como o sistema
funcionava na cadeia. O truque era que você conservava
a memória de longo prazo até o ponto em que
começavam a administrar a droga. Assim, podiam treiná-
lo para fazer algo antes que começasse a cumprir sua
pena, porque você não se esqueceria daquilo. Eram
basicamente coisas que robôs poderiam fazer. Haviam
treinado Slick para montar engrenagens de trens em
miniatura; quando aprendeu como montar uma em cinco
minutos, foi isso.
– E eles não fizeram mais nada? – ela perguntou.
– Só as engrenagens de trem.
– Não, quero dizer, como bloqueadores de cérebro.
Olhou para ela. A ferida no seu lábio estava quase
curada. – Se fazem isso, não nos contam –
respondeu.
Então o bíper disparou em uma de suas jaquetas.– Algo está errado – disse, levantando-se rapidamente.
***
Encontraram Gentry ajoelhado ao lado
segurando algo preto nas mãos. Cherry
da
maca
arrancou a coisa dele antes que Gentry pudesse se
mover. Ele ficou onde estava, olhando fixo para ela e
piscando muito.
– É difícil manter você apagado, cara. – Entregou para
Slick a coisa preta. Uma câmera retinal.
– Temos que descobrir quem ele é – disse Gentry. Sua voz
estava grogue com as drogas que ela
tinha administrado, mas Slick sentiu que o lado mais
barra-pesada da loucura tinha retrocedido.
– Que diabos – disse ela. – Você nem sabe se estes são os
olhos que ele tinha há um ano.
Gentry tocou o curativo em sua testa. – Você também
viu, não é?
– Sim – disse Cherry. – Ele desligou a coisa.
– Foi o choque – disse Gentry. – Eu não tinha imaginado...
Não havia perigo real. Eu não estava
preparado...
– Você estava completamente pirado – disse Cherry.
Gentry ficou de pé, meio desequilibrado.– Ele está de saída – disse Slick. – Mandei o Bird pegar
um caminhão emprestado. Não estou gostando nem um
pouco dessa merda toda.
Cherry encarou-o. – De saída para onde? Eu tenho que ir
junto. É o meu trabalho.
– Conheço um lugar – mentiu Slick. – A energia caiu,
Gentry.
– Você não pode levá-lo para lugar algum – disse Gentry.
– Não enche.
– Não, sério. – Gentry estava balançando ligeiramente. –
Ele fica. Os jumpers estão no lugar.
Não vou mais perturbá-lo. Cherry pode ficar aqui.
– Você vai ter que explicar essa merda, Gentry – disse
Slick.
– Para começar – disse Gentry, e apontou para a coisa
sobre a cabeça do Conde – isto não é um
“ele-efe”; é um aleph.

ENTRANDO NA FACA
Hotel de novo, afundando na marcha fúnebre da ressaca
do wiz, Prior conduzindo-a pelo vestíbulo, turistas
japoneses já de pé, rodeando guias de aparência
entediada. E um passo, outro passo, um passo após o
outro, sua cabeça tão pesada agora, como se alguém
tivesse aberto um buraco em cima, derramado meioquilo de chumbo, e seus dentes pareciam pertencer a
outra pessoa,
grandes demais; ela se desequilibrou no elevador,
quando a gravidade adicional a pressionou.
– Cadê o Eddy?
– Eddy foi embora, Mona.
Abriu bem os olhos e olhou para ele, vendo que o sorriso
estava de volta, filho da mãe. – O
quê?
– Eddy foi comprado. Compensado. Está a caminho de
Macau com uma linha de crédito. Uma
bela temporada de jogatina às nossas custas.
– Compensado?
– Por seu investimento. Em você. Pelo tempo dele.
– Tempo dele? – As portas se abriram frente ao corredor
de carpete azul.
E alguma coisa caindo dentro dela, fria: Eddy odiava
jogar.
– Você trabalha para nós agora, Mona. Não gostaríamos
que saísse por aí sozinha novamente.
Mas você deixou, pensou, me deixou sair. E sabia onde
me encontrar.
Eddy foi embora...***
Não se lembrou de ter pegado no sono. Ainda estava
usando o vestido, a jaqueta de Michael jogada por sobre
os ombros como um cobertor. Podia ver o canto do prédio
em forma de montanha
pela janela, sem mexer a cabeça, mas o carneiro de
longos chifres não estava lá.
Os stims de Angie ainda estavam lacrados no plástico.
Pegou um deles, aleatoriamente, rasgou a
embalagem com a unha, encaixou-o na ranhura e
colocou os trodos. Não estava pensando; suas mãos
pareciam saber o que fazer, animais amigáveis que não
iriam machucá-la. Um deles apertou PLAY e
ela escorregou para dentro do mundo de Angie, puro
como qualquer droga, saxofone lânguido e passeio de
limusine por alguma cidade europeia, a forma como as
ruas revolviam em torno dela, em
torno do carro sem motorista, avenidas largas, limpas e
vazias ao amanhecer, com o toque de um casaco de pele
em seus ombros, rodando por uma estrada reta através
de campos sem relevo, delineados por árvores perfeitas
e idênticas.
E, virando uma rua, pneus sobre cascalho, subindo uma
estradinha sinuosa em meio a um parque, onde o orvalho
era prateado, um cervo de ferro de um lado, um torso de
mármore úmido mais à frente... A casa era ampla, antiga,
diferente de qualquer casa que já havia visto antes, mas
o carro passou por ela, depois por vários prédios
menores, chegando finalmente à borda de um amplocampo liso.
Havia vários planadores amarrados,
translúcida esticada sobre molduras de
a
membrana
policarbono de aparência frágil. Agitavam-se suavemente
na brisa da manhã. Robin Lanier estava esperando ao
lado deles, lindo, tranquilo, num suéter preto, Robin, que
contracenava com Angie em quase todos os seus stims.
E ela estava saindo do carro em direção ao campo, rindo
quando seus saltos afundaram na grama. E o resto do
caminho em direção a Robin descalça, sapatos nas mãos,
sorrindo, para os braços dele e seu perfume, seus olhos.
Um giro rápido, a edição criando uma dança,
condensando os detalhes de embarcar no planador
sobre o trilho de indução prateado, depois foram
arremessados suavemente sobre a extensão do campo,
elevando-se, inclinando-se para pegar o vento, e para
cima, para cima, até que a enorme casa tornou-se uma
pequena pedra numa vastidão de verde, verde cortado
pelo brilho de um rio em curva...
...e a mão de Prior na tecla stop, o cheiro de comida
vindo de um carrinho ao lado da mesa dando nós em seu
estômago, a dor surda, enjoada, da ressaca do wiz em
cada articulação. – Coma –
disse ele. – Estamos de saída. – Tirou a tampa de metal
de uma das travessas. – Um grande sanduíche de carne –
disse ele –, café, salgadinhos. Ordens médicas. Quando
você estiver na clínica, não vai poder comer por um
tempo...
– Clínica?– De Gerald. Em Baltimore.
– Por quê?
– Gerald é cirurgião plástico. Vão fazer algumas
intervenções em você. Tudo reversível mais tarde, se
você quiser, mas achamos que ficará satisfeita com os
resultados. Muito satisfeita. – O
sorriso. – Alguém já lhe disse o quanto você é parecida
com Angie, Mona?
Olhou para ele sem dizer nada. Deu um jeito de erguer-
se, beber meia xícara de café aguado.
Não podia sequer olhar para o sanduíche, mas comeu um
dos salgadinhos. Tinha gosto de papelão.
Baltimore. Não sabia bem onde aquilo ficava.
E, em algum lugar, um planador flutuando para sempre
sobre o campo verde, o casaco de pele
em seus ombros e Angie ainda devia estar lá, ainda
rindo...
***
Uma hora mais tarde, no vestíbulo, enquanto Prior
assinava a conta, viu as malas de imitação de
couro de crocodilo de Eddy passando num carrinho de
bagagem robótico, foi quando teve certeza de
que ele estava morto.
***O consultório de Gerald tinha uma placa com grandes
letras antigas, no quarto andar de um condomínio no que
Prior dizia ser Baltimore. O tipo de prédio onde jogavam
uma estrutura e os inquilinos comerciais traziam os seus
próprios módulos, plug-ins. Como um acampamento de
trailers na vertical, tudo percorrido por um emaranhado
de cabos, fibra óptica, o encanamento para esgoto e
água. – O que está escrito? – perguntou a Prior.
– Gerald Chin, Dentista.
– Você disse que ele era um cirurgião plástico.
– Ele é.
– Por que não podemos apenas ir a uma butique, como
todo mundo?
Ele não respondeu.
Ela não estava realmente sentindo muita coisa naquele
momento, e parte dela sabia que não estava tão
assustada quanto deveria. Talvez estivesse tudo bem,
contudo, porque se ficasse apavorada demais não seria
capaz de fazer nada, e ela realmente queria pular fora
daquele negócio todo, seja lá o que fosse. Na viagem de
carro, encontrou algo volumoso no bolso da jaqueta de
Michael. Levou
uns dez minutos para entender que era uma arma de
choque, do tipo que os figurões carregavam.
Parecia uma chave de fenda com um par de chifres de
metal rombudos no lugar da ponta.
Provavelmente era carregada usando uma tomada
normal; estava torcendo para que Michael a tivessedeixado carregada. Concluiu que Prior não sabia que
aquilo estava ali. Aquelas coisas eram legais, na maioria
dos lugares, porque não deviam provocar um estrago
permanente, mas Lanette conhecia uma
garota que tinha sido atacada com uma daquelas e
nunca mais se recuperara.
Se Prior não sabia que estava no bolso dela, significava
que ele não sabia de tudo, e parte do jogo dele era fazer
com que ela pensasse que sabia. Mas ele também não
sabia o quanto Eddy odiava jogar e apostar.
Não conseguia sentir muita coisa pelo Eddy, exceto que
continuava achando que estava morto.
Não importava quanto tivessem pago a ele, jamais iria
embora sem aquelas malas. Mesmo que tivesse ido
comprar um guarda-roupa totalmente novo, precisaria
vestir-se bem para fazer as compras. Eddy se importava
com roupas mais do que tudo. E aquelas malas de
crocodilo eram especiais: ele as tinha conseguido com
um ladrão de hotéis em Orlando e eram a coisa mais
próxima que ele tinha de um
lar. E agora que estava pensando sobre o assunto, não
dava para acreditar que ele aceitasse ser comprado e
sair fora, porque a coisa que mais queria no mundo era
fazer parte de um grande esquema. Depois disso, ele
achava que as pessoas passariam a levá-lo a sério.
Então, finalmente, alguém o levou a sério, pensou ela,
enquanto Prior carregava sua sacola para
a clínica de Gerald. Mas não como Eddy queria.Olhou ao redor da mobília de plástico de uns vinte anos
atrás, as pilhas de revistas sobre estrelas do stim em
caracteres japoneses. Parecia um salão de beleza de
Cleveland. Não havia ninguém lá, ninguém atrás do
balcão da recepção.
Então Gerald apareceu, saindo de uma porta branca,
vestindo um daqueles jalecos de laminado
enrugado que os paramédicos vestiam em acidentes de
trânsito. – Tranque a porta – disse para Prior, sob uma
máscara de papel que cobria seu nariz, boca e queixo. –
Olá, Mona. Por favor, por aqui... –
Ele apontou para a porta branca.
Ela estava segurando a arma de choque, mas não sabia
como ligá-la.
Seguiu Gerald; Prior veio atrás.
– Sente-se – disse Gerald. Ela se sentou numa cadeira
branca esmaltada. Ele se aproximou, olhou para os olhos
dela. – Você precisa descansar, Mona. Está exausta.
Havia um botão serrilhado no punho da arma de choque.
Pressionar? Para a frente? Para trás?
Gerald foi até uma caixa branca com gavetas, tirou
alguma coisa de lá.
– Aqui – disse ele, estendendo uma coisinha em forma de
tubo com algo escrito no lado – isto
vai ajudá-la... – Ela mal sentiu a diminuta dose de spray;
havia uma mancha escura no tubo de aerosol, bem onde
os olhos dela tentavam focar, crescendo...***
Lembrou-se do velho mostrando como matar um bagre.
O bagre tem um buraco em seu crânio,
coberto com pele; pega-se algo rígido e fino, um arame,
até mesmo uma palha de vassoura serve, basta
introduzir...
***
Lembrou-se de Cleveland, um desses dias comuns, antes
de chegar a hora de trabalhar, sentada
na casa de Lanette, olhando uma revista. Encontrou uma
foto de Angie rindo num restaurante com outras pessoas,
todos bonitos, mas além disso eles tinham um brilho, não
estava na fotografia mas estava presente mesmo assim,
algo que podia ser sentido. Olha, disse para Lanette,
mostrando a foto, eles têm esse brilho.
Isso se chama dinheiro, disse Lanette.
***
Isso se chama dinheiro. Basta introduzir.

HILTON SWIFT
Ele chegou sem avisar, como sempre, e sozinho; o
helicóptero da Net pousou como uma vespa
solitária, espirrando pedaços de algas ao longo da areia
úmida.Ela observou da balaustrada enferrujada quando ele
saltou, algo jovial e quase desajeitado em
seu aparente entusiasmo. Vestia um longo sobretudo de
tweed marrom desabotoado, revelava a frente imaculada
de uma de suas camisas listradas, o turbilhão da hélice
agitando seu cabelo castanho-dourado e fazendo
tremular sua gravata da Sense/Net. Robin estava certo,
ela concluiu: era mesmo como se sua mãe o vestisse.
Talvez fosse deliberado, pensou, enquanto ele avançava
pela praia, uma falsa ingenuidade.
Lembrou-se que Porphyre uma vez tinha argumentado
que as grandes corporações eram inteiramente
independentes dos seres humanos que compunham o
conselho diretor. Havia parecido muito óbvio para Angie,
mas o cabeleireiro havia insistido que ela não tinha se
dado conta de sua premissa básica.
Swift era o executivo humano mais importante da
Sense/Net.
O pensamento de Porphyre a fez sorrir; Swift, pensando
que era um cumprimento, sorriu de volta.
***
Ofereceu-se para levá-la para almoçar em São Francisco;
o helicóptero era extremamente veloz.
Ela recusou, insistindo em preparar uma tigela de sopa
suíça desidratada e aquecer no micro-ondas um pão de
centeio congelado.Ela se perguntou, observando-o comer, sobre
sexualidade. Com mais de trinta anos, quase
sua
quarenta, de certo modo tinha o jeito de um adolescente
extraordinariamente brilhante, cujo início da puberdade
havia sido sutilmente atrasado. Rumores, vez por outra,
já haviam atribuído a ele cada uma das preferências
sexuais conhecidas, além de muitas que ela acreditava
serem totalmente imaginárias.
Nenhuma delas parecia provável para Angie. Ela o
conhecia desde que entrou para a Sense/Net; ele já
estava solidamente estabelecido nos escalões mais altos
de produção quando ela chegou – era uma das pessoas
mais importantes na equipe de Tally Isham e ficou
imediatamente interessado nela, profissionalmente. Em
retrospecto, ela presumia que Legba a havia colocado no
caminho dele, que
obviamente estava a caminho do topo, embora ela
própria talvez não tivesse percebido, na época, fascinada
com o brilho e o constante movimento daquele meio.
Bobby sentiu uma antipatia imediata por ele, movido
pela hostilidade inerente de alguém saído
de Barrytown contra qualquer autoridade, mas sempre
conseguira esconder isso, pelo bem da carreira dela. A
antipatia era mútua e Swift comemorou a separação e a
partida de Bobby, com evidente alívio.
– Hilton – disse ela, enquanto servia uma xícara de chá
de ervas, que ele preferia em vez de café
–, por que Robin ainda está em Londres?Ele olhou de volta, por cima da xícara fervente. – Algo
pessoal, acho. Talvez ele tenha encontrado um novo
amigo. – Bobby sempre tinha sido o amigo de Angie, para
Hilton. Os amigos de Robin eram sempre homens jovens
e atléticos; as discretas sequências eróticas dela com
Robin nos
stims eram montadas a partir de imagens de arquivo
fornecidas por Continuidade e muito manipuladas por
Raebel e sua equipe de efeitos especiais. Lembrou-se de
uma noite que passaram juntos, numa casa no sul de
Madagascar, a passividade e a paciência dele. Nunca
mais tentaram novamente, e ela suspeitava de que ele
tivesse medo de que a intimidade pudesse sabotar a
ilusão que seus stims projetavam tão perfeitamente.
– O que ele achou de eu ter ido para a clínica, Hilton? Ele
disse?
– Acho que admirou o que você fez.
– Alguém me disse, recentemente, que ele tem falado às
pessoas que estou louca.
Ele puxou suas mangas listradas e afrouxou a gravata. –
Não consigo imaginar Robin pensando
isso, muito menos dizendo isso. Eu sei o que ele pensa
de você. Você sabe como são as fofocas, na Net...
– Hilton, onde está Bobby?
Seus olhos castanhos, muito fixos. – Ainda isso, Angie?
– Hilton, você sabe. Deve saber. Você sabe onde ele está.
Me conta.– Nós o perdemos.
– Perderam?
– A segurança o perdeu. Você está certa, é claro: nós o
rastreamos bem de perto, depois que partiu. Ele voltou
ao seu meio. – Havia um tom de satisfação em sua voz.
– E que meio era esse?
– Nunca perguntei como vocês se conheceram – disse
ele. – A segurança investigou vocês dois,
é claro. Ele era um marginal de segunda.
Ela riu. – Nem mesmo isso...
– Você estava incrivelmente bem representada, Angie,
para uma desconhecida. Seus agentes colocaram como
condição-chave em seu contrato que também ficássemos
com Bobby Newmark.
– Outros contratos já tiveram condições mais estranhas,
Hilton.
– E ele aparece na folha de pagamentos como seu...
companheiro.
– Meu “amigo”.
Swift estava realmente enrubescendo? Ele desviou os
olhos, olhando para baixo, para as mãos. –
Quando ele partiu, foi para o México, para a Cidade do
México. A segurança estava em seu encalço, é claro; não
gostamos de perder o rastro de qualquer um que saiba
demais sobre a vida pessoal de uma de nossas estrelas.
Mas a Cidade do México é um lugar... muito complicado...Sabemos que ele parecia querer retomar sua antiga...
carreira.
– Ele estava fazendo armações no ciberespaço?
Olhou-a nos olhos, de novo. – Estava se encontrando com
pessoas do ramo, criminosos
conhecidos.
– E? Continue.
– Ele... desapareceu. Sumiu. Você tem alguma ideia do
que seja a Cidade do México, se você escorregar para
baixo da linha de pobreza?
– E ele estava pobre?
– Ele se tornou um viciado. De acordo com as nossas
melhores fontes.
– Um viciado? Viciado em quê?
– Não sei.
– Continuidade!
Ele quase cuspiu o chá.
– Olá, Angie.
– Bobby, Continuidade. Bobby Newmark, meu amigo –
olhando furiosamente para Swift. – Ele
foi para a Cidade do México. Hilton está dizendo que
ficou
viciado
em
alguma
coisa.
Uma
droga,
Continuidade?– Desculpe, Angie. Esses dados são confidenciais.
– Hilton...
– Continuidade – ele começou, e tossiu.
– Olá, Hilton.
– Prioridade
informação?
executiva,
Continuidade.
Temos
essa
– Fontes da Segurança descreveram o vício de Newmark
como neuroeletrônico.
– Eu não entendo.
– É uma espécie de, bem, “wirehead” , estimulação direta
dos centros de prazer... – disse Swift,
hesitante. Ela teve um impulso de contar que havia
encontrado a droga, o carregador.
Silêncio, criança. Sua cabeça estava cheia com o som de
abelhas, uma pressão crescente.
– Angie? O que houve? – Levantou-se da cadeira,
tentando ajudá-la.
– Nada. Estou... confusa. Desculpe. Nervos. Não é culpa
sua. Eu ia lhe contar que encontrei o console de
ciberespaço de Bobby. Mas você já sabia disso, não é?
– Posso pegar alguma coisa para você? Água?
– Não, obrigada, mas vou deitar um pouco, se você não
se importar. Mas fique, por favor.Tenho algumas ideias para as sequências orbitais e
queria ouvir a sua opinião...
– Claro. Tire um cochilo, vou dar uma caminhada na praia
e depois conversamos.
***
Ela o observou da janela do quarto, assistindo sua figura
marrom diminuir em direção à Colônia, seguido pelo
pequeno e paciente Dornier.
Parecia uma criança na praia deserta; parecia tão
perdido quanto ela se sentia.

O ALEPH
Quando o sol se ergueu, ainda sem energia para as
lâmpadas de 100 watts, o loft de Gentry se
encheu com uma nova luz. A luz do sol de inverno
suavizava os contornos dos consoles e da mesa
holográfica, dava uma nova textura aos livros antigos
que se alinhavam em prateleiras de compensado
arqueado na parede da esquerda. Enquanto Gentry
caminhava e falava, seu rabo-de-cavalo loiro sacudindo
cada vez que girava nos calcanhares da bota preta, sua
excitação parecia sobrepujar os efeitos calmantes dos
dermas para dormir de Cherry. Cherry estava sentada na
beira da cama, observando Gentry mas dando uma
olhada ocasional no indicador da bateria que ficava na
superestrutura da maca. Slick estava sentado numa
cadeira quebrada que havia sido recolhida de Solitude eforrada com plástico transparente, sobre um estofamento
de roupas velhas.
Para o alívio de Slick, Gentry tinha deixado de lado a
história da Forma e se lançado em sua teoria sobre o tal
do aleph. Como sempre, depois que Gentry se animava,
usava palavras e construções que Slick tinha dificuldade
de entender, mas Slick sabia, por experiência própria,
que era melhor não interrompê-lo; o truque era captar
algum sentido do fluxo total, pulando as partes que não
entendia.
Gentry disse que o Conde estava conectado no que
acabava sendo um megaenorme microsoft:
ele achava que todo aquele bloco era um único e sólido
biochip.
Se
fosse
verdade,
a
capacidade
de
armazenamento da coisa era virtualmente infinita; teria
