very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and
affairs—a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley—and
not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to
his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say,
Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the
house—a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent—and obtained the whole
mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the
impending torrent of unctuous haggling.
It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions
were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in
Charles‘s third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this
removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the
Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing
overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the company‘s
motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimney‘s course, and
in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain
directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or
contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust
and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile
shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of
the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was
in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the
volume as the ―Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of
Salem.”
Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen
beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and
Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he
began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwen‘s handwriting,
and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: ―To Him Who Shal
Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.” Another was in a cipher; the
same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here
the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were
addressed respectively to ―Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger‖ and ―Jedediah Orne, Esq.‖, ‗or Their
Heir or Heirs, or Those Represent‘g Them‘. The sixth and last was inscribed: ―Joseph Curwen
his Life and Travells Bet’n ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyag’d, Where He
Stay’d, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.”
3.
We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date
Charles Ward‘s madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of
the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which
impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to
guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the
antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning
home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of
its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the
titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph
Curwen‘s handwriting, ―mostly in cipher‖, which would have to be studied very carefully before
yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the
workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to
avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.
That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and
when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to
see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when
the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he
slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the
cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy
of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her
query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned
his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture
with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and
overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with
panelling to match the room‘s. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to
allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and
sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at
him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.
His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent
the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which
he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwen‘s intricate and archaic
chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more
circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic
symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled ―To Him Who Shal Come After etc.‖
seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At
night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also
placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits,
except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of
school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently
asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special
investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and
the humanities than any university which the world could boast.
Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could
have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was
constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at
the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother
thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any
connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as
due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks
passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a
kind of constraint; intensified in his mother‘s case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen
delvings.
During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian
matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he
sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for
Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at
Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical
subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves
in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas
holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain
records at the Essex Institute.
About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Ward‘s bearing an element of triumph which
he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead,
he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one
a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital
statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave
astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he
purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to
the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the
grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the
name.
Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong.
Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and
absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence;
and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He
had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete
alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to
his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly—one almost fancied
increasingly—similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great
overmantel on the north wall.
Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the
various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from
City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted
from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained
when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a
fragmentary record of Curwen‘s burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which
stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred ―10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali
Field‘s grave in ye—‖. The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly
complicated the search, and Naphthali Field‘s grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen;
but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to
stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles—from which St.
John‘s (the former King‘s) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the
midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only
Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.
4.
It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the
Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with
the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every
moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real
importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his
recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward
seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that
the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific
knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the
discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however,
meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their
immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all
impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human
thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they
evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to
acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen
data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the
utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could
more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.
As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose
progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwen‘s mutilated
headstone bore certain mystic symbols—carved from directions in his will and ignorantly
spared by those who had effaced the name—which were absolutely essential to the final
solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care;
and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett
asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off
with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and
diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds—the ―Journall
and Notes”, the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message ―To Him Who Shal
Come After”—and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.
He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a
glimpse of Curwen‘s connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the
crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung
round both penmanship and style despite the writer‘s survival into the eighteenth century, and
became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial,
and Willett recalled only a fragment:
―Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX
newe Men pick‘d up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from
Surinam. Ye Dutch Men are like to Desert from have‘g hearde Somewhat ill of

Transylvania, tho‘ it is Harde reach‘g him and exceeding strange he can not give
me the Use of what he hath so well us‘d these hundred yeares. Simon hath not
Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hear‘g from him.‖
When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward,
who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the
newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered
tenaciously in his memory. They ran: ―Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus be‘g spoke V
Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breed‘g Outside ye Spheres. It
will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past
thinges and look back thro‘ all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or
That to make ‘em with.‖
Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the
painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after
that he entertained the odd fancy—which his medical skill of course assured him was only a
fancy—that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow
young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the
picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail
of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above
the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that
produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.
Assured by the doctor that Charles‘s mental health was in no danger, but that on the other
hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were
more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth
made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital
importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail
himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this
latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that
after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a
three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised
as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his family‘s friends than
he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other
cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who
dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he
sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices
had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.
Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his
maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him.
Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry
him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw
he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that
in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and
mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier
in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in
Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he
had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he
wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and
he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing
of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and
steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas
alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to
which his new interests had engrossed his mind.
In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or
two flying trips for material in the Bibliothèque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent
only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search
among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided
acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a
silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia,
stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very
aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval
information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following
January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city
on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-
delvers into the occult had invited him.
The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Ward‘s progress toward his
destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of
Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from
Rakus a week later, saying that his host‘s carriage had met him and that he was leaving the
village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not
reply to his parents‘ frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his
mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards
were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave
his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczy‘s castle did not favour visits. It was
on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk
that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person
likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners
had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles
said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.
That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the
young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to
Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant,
blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of
ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and
entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat
with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues
was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had
delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before
and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and
steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal
behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the
ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink
in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.
Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history
which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets
whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the
case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A
taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market
House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to
Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian
Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish
eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at
last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and
stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles
Dexter Ward had come home.
5.
A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lyman‘s assign to Ward‘s European trip
the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe
that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett
refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth
at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad—odd enough things, to be
sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself,
though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several
talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman—even an incipient one—could feign
continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard
at all hours from Ward‘s attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were
chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although
these sounds were always in Ward‘s own voice, there was something in the quality of that
voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of
every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household,
bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.
The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange.
Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting,
elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who
smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with
strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite
distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the
strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters;
explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and
promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling
degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause
by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit
above the picture‘s right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the
living youth. These calls of Willett‘s, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were
curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never
reach the young man‘s inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax
images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles,
triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room.
And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult
to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charles‘s madness.
In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was
chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there
came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth
which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal
traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a
sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr.
and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what
damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and
portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He
assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be
over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the
lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid
gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died
away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Ward‘s face crystallised into a
very singular expression.
For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his
laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the
date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after
midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a
rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and
Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box
from a truck at Charles‘s direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured
breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after
which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in
their truck.
The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his
laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open
the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound
followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her
son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and
indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary.
Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon,
after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal,
he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter
the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of
secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious
garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and
added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books
brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and
moved to it all his scientific effects.
In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it
through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by
various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found
that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:
Nocturnal Diggers Surprised in North Burial Ground
Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a
party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but
apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object
may have been.
The discovery took place at about four o‘clock, when Hart‘s attention was attracted
by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on
the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his
feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box
in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and
since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object
which they wished to bury.
The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart
found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in
the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared.
The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide
with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.
Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the
hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe
cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said
he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he
could not be sure.
During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping
quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door
and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous
formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times
occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water,
or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted,
hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse
whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he
made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger
to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over
the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss
what to do or think about it.
6.
Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to
grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett
somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a
circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as
an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain
formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that
its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall
outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and
listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willett‘s request. It ran as
follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the
mystic writings of ―Eliphas Levi‖, that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden
door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:
―Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,
Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,
verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,
conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,
daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,
Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.‖
This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the
neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be
judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward
household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-
pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the
midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which
would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the
voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible
depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Ward‘s voice. It shook the house, and was
clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had
been listening in despair outside her son‘s locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its
hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in
which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet
farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwen‘s annihilation. There was no mistaking that
nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked
frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and
forgotten language: ―DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS‖.
Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset
was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally
unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear
syllables that sounded like ―Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog‖—ending in a ―Yah!‖
whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous
memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and
gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the
mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the
concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused
nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son,
and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently
she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory
sometimes makes merciful deletions.
Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife
downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charles‘s
door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at
once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the
laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set
bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to
observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her
eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which
she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to
be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for
comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.
It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely
different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of
inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was
undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youth‘s
best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something
hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife
which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore
Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never
fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she
could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not
quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger
dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Ward‘s cry had evidently been heard by others than he,
and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that
masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charles‘s
own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who
overheard them. The phrase was just this:
―Sshh!—write!”
Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a
firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such
conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit
of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household.
The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright
madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed
voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would
be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.
Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charles‘s laboratory. On the
third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now
disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled,
and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast
armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charles‘s aspect was very drawn and
haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his father‘s voice. At the
elder man‘s command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so
long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was
right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed
inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a
prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely
book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be
necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest
contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism
designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms
somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and
poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite
inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew
what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose
stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-
distorted mouth.
Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the
vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youth‘s library was plainly
and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books
which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of
the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These
new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals
of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was
a very curious shift from Charles Ward‘s recent run of reading, and the father paused in a
growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a
very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was
wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever
since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it
dawned upon him what it was.
On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but
to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come.
Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the room‘s last
cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and
finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the
portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so
strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey
dust.
IV. A Mutation and a Madness
1.
In the week following that memorable Good Friday Charles Ward was seen more often than
usual, and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory. His
actions were quiet and rational, but he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like,
and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook. Dr.
Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and on the following Tuesday
had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more. The
interview was, as always, inconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth was
sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early revelation, and spoke of the
need of securing a laboratory elsewhere. At the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little
considering his first enthusiasm over it, but seemed to find something of positive humour in its
sudden crumbling.
About the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for long periods, and one
day when good old black Hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his
frequent visits to the old house in Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and
perform curious delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but
seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had
watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where
some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He seemed to
haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by
Dr. Willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to
the rather hedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north, usually not
reappearing for a very long while.
Late in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which
brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment
from Charles. It occurred one morning, and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary
conversation noted on that turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or remonstrating
hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing
shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused Mrs. Ward to
run upstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain
words were ―must have it red for three months‖, and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at
once. When Charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain
conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which he would
try to transfer to other realms.
About the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the early evening there had
been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs, and Mr. Ward was on the point of
investigating when it suddenly quieted down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the
butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement Charles appeared
somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made
signs that he wished egress. The youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught
one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and young Ward
went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation to Mrs. Ward. There was, he said,
something unholy in the glance Charles had fixed on him. It was no way for a young
gentleman to look at an honest person, and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs.
Ward allowed the man to depart, but she did not value his statement highly. To fancy Charles
in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous, for as long as she had remained awake she
had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing, and of
a sighing which told only of despair‘s profoundest depths. Mrs. Ward had grown used to
listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her
mind.
The next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months before, Charles Ward
seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section. The matter was not
recalled till later, when Dr. Willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing
links here and there. In the Journal office he found the section which Charles had lost, and
marked two items as of possible significance. They were as follows:
More Cemetery Delving
It was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial
Ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery. The
grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born in 1740 and died in 1824, according to his
uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone, was found excavated and rifled,
the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool-shed.
Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial, all was
gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There were no wheel tracks, but the
police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity, and
which indicate the boots of a man of refinement.
Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last March, when a
party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation; but
Sergt. Riley of the Second Station discounts this theory and points to vital
differences in the two cases. In March the digging had been in a spot where no
grave was known; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled
with every evidence of deliberate purpose, and with a conscious malignity
expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before.
Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their
astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would
care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell Street
recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in some very
peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before the Revolution;
but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham
has been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the
near future.
Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet
Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying
of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-
Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to
most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was
mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A
sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the
bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours,
probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident;
and may have had their share in exciting the dogs.
The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed in retrospect
that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which
sheer terror withheld him. The morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact
that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more
academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism
which the press so sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been
definitely traced to any known perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need
detailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two
distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End, near the Ward home, and the
suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers
with open windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a
lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper
arm and feasted ravenously.
Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back as even this, is
cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has, he declares, certain theories of his
own; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. ―I will not,‖ he says,
―state who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and murders, but I will declare that
Charles Ward was innocent of them. I have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of
blood, as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any
verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was never a
monster or a villain. As for now—I don‘t like to think. A change came, and I‘m content to
believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow, for that mad flesh that
vanished from Waite‘s hospital had another.‖
Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending Mrs. Ward, whose
nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid
hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in
talking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always
concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom,
and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times.
Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn,
and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering
letters. It is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and
continued sanity.
2.
Not long after his mother‘s departure Charles Ward began negotiating for the Pawtuxet
bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage, perched high on the
sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth
would have nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured
it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner, and as soon as it was
vacant he took possession under cover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the
entire contents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and modern which he
had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the black small hours, and his father
recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods
were taken away. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and
never haunted the attic again.
To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded
his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-
looking Portuguese half-caste from the South Main St. waterfront who acted as a servant, and
a thin, scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose
status was evidently that of a colleague. Neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons
in conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke very little English, and the bearded man, who
gave his name as Dr. Allen, voluntarily followed his example. Ward himself tried to be more
affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical
research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights;
and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of
disproportionate orders of meat from the butcher‘s and of the muffled shouting, declamation,
rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the
place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest
bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting
the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders;
especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the
adjacent streets of Edgewood.
Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and was still
reckoned a dweller beneath his father‘s roof. Twice he was absent from the city on week-long
trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more
emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr.
Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his
father‘s house, for the elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to
get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and
independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this, and
adduces many a conversation to prove his point.
About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January Ward almost became
involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks
at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen
hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope
Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by ―hi-jackers‖ in quest of
liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock.
For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome
things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of
the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State
Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently arrested vagrant, under
promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a
party of troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and
shameful thing. It would not be well for the national—or even the international—sense of
decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party. There
was no mistaking it, even by these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington
ensued with feverish rapidity.
The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and State and Federal
officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call. They found him pallid and worried
with his two odd companions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation
and evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a
programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last
decade could prove, and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he
had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the specimens
he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at
the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter
would produce. In this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen,
whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in
the end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name and address
which Ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair to add
that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places, and that the
general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance.
On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which he considers of
extraordinary importance, and about which he has frequently quarrelled with Dr. Lyman.
Lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia
praecox, but Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the
hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship; which
though shewing traces of shattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Ward‘s own. The text in
full is as follows:
―100 Prospect St.
Providence, R.I.,
February 8, 1928.
―Dear Dr. Willett:—
―I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which I have
so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me so often. The patience
you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and
integrity, are things I shall never cease to appreciate.
―And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no triumph
such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead of triumph I have found terror, and
my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in
saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or
calculation. You recall what those Fenner letters said of the old raiding party at
Pawtuxet. That must all be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more than
can be put into words—all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the
solar system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous abnormality, but
I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the sake of all life and Nature you must
help me thrust it back into the dark again.
―I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate everything existing
there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again, and you must not believe it if you
ever hear that I am there. I will tell you why I say this when I see you. I have come
home for good, and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you
can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what I have to say. It will take that
long—and believe me when I tell you that you never had a more genuine
professional duty than this. My life and reason are the very least things which hang
in the balance.
―I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But I have told him
of my danger, and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house. I
don‘t know how much good they can do, for they have against them forces which
even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to
see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell.
―Any time will do—I shall not be out of the house. Don‘t telephone ahead, for there
is no telling who or what may try to intercept you. And let us pray to whatever gods
there be that nothing may prevent this meeting.
―In utmost gravity and desperation,
―Charles Dexter Ward.‖
―P.S. Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Don‘t burn it.‖
Dr. Willett received this note about 10:30 a.m., and immediately arranged to spare the whole
late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk, letting it extend on into the night as long
as might be necessary. He planned to arrive about four o‘clock, and through all the
intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were
very mechanically performed. Maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett
had seen too much of Charles Ward‘s oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving. That something
very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure, and the reference to
Dr. Allen could almost be comprehended in view of what Pawtuxet gossip said of Ward‘s
enigmatical colleague. Willett had never seen the man, but had heard much of his aspect and
bearing, and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses
might conceal.
Promptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence, but found to his
annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors. The guards
were there, but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that
morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone, one of
the detectives said, replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as ―I am very tired
and must rest a while‖, ―I can‘t receive anyone for some time, you‘ll have to excuse me‖,
―Please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise‖, or ―I am very
sorry, but I must take a complete vacation from everything; I‘ll talk with you later‖. Then,
apparently gaining boldness through meditation, he had slipped out so quietly that no one had
seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one o‘clock and entered
the house without a word. He had gone upstairs, where a bit of his fear must have surged
back; for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library,
afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had gone to
inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness, and
had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had
evidently done some rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping and
creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once. Willett inquired whether or
not any message had been left, but was told that there was none. The butler seemed queerly
disturbed about something in Charles‘s appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if
there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.
For almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Ward‘s library, watching the dusty
shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed, and smiling grimly at the
panelled overmantel on the north wall, whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph
Curwen had looked mildly down. After a time the shadows began to gather, and the sunset
cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward
finally arrived, and shewed much surprise and anger at his son‘s absence after all the pains
which had been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charles‘s appointment, and
promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In bidding the doctor goodnight he
expressed his utter perplexity at his son‘s condition, and urged his caller to do all he could to
restore the boy to normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for something
frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of
evil. He had never liked that picture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there
lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the
pure air as soon as possible.
3.
The next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward, saying that Charles was
still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr. Allen had telephoned him to say that Charles would
remain at Pawtuxet for some time, and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary
because Allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period, leaving the
researches in need of Charles‘s constant oversight. Charles sent his best wishes, and
regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused. In listening to this
message Mr. Ward heard Dr. Allen‘s voice for the first time, and it seemed to excite some
vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed, but which was disturbing to
the point of fearfulness.
Faced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was frankly at a loss what to do.
The frantic earnestness of Charles‘s note was not to be denied, yet what could one think of its
writer‘s immediate violation of his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written that his
delvings had become blasphemous and menacing, that they and his bearded colleague must
be extirpated at any cost, and that he himself would never return to their final scene; yet
according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery.
Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness, yet some deeper
instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it over
again, and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic
verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply. Its terror was too profound and real,
and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities
from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation. There were nameless
horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to get at them, one ought to stand
prepared for any sort of action at any time.
For over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him, and
became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of
the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its
interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct
conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving brief and non-
committal typed notes from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement
had had no better word. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious
sensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent revelations and
warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river.
Willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity, though of course never entering the
house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew exactly the route to take. Driving out Broad
Street one early afternoon toward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of
the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven years before on
a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.
The ride through the city‘s decaying fringe was short, and trim Edgewood and sleepy
Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned to the right down Lockwood Street and
drove his car as far along that rural road as he could, then alighted and walked north to where
the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands
beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its
concrete garage on a high point of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel
walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor to the evil
Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.
He must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important business. No excuse would
be accepted, and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder Ward. The
mulatto still hesitated, and pushed against the door when Willett attempted to open it; but the
doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands. Then there came from the dark
interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did
not know why he feared it. ―Let him in, Tony,‖ it said, ―we may as well talk now as ever.‖ But
disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that which immediately followed. The floor
creaked and the speaker hove in sight—and the owner of those strange and resonant tones
was seen to be no other than Charles Dexter Ward.
The minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that
afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period. For at last he concedes
a vital change in Charles Dexter Ward‘s mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke from
a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years.
Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him to be very specific, and he definitely dates the
madness of Charles Ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents.
Those notes are not in Ward‘s normal style; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to
Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of the writer‘s mind had
released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood
antiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit and occasionally the
language are those of the past.
The past, too, was evident in Ward‘s every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that
shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that
strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset.
―I am grown phthisical,‖ he began, ―from this cursed river air. You must excuse my speech. I
suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me, and I hope you will say nothing to
alarm him.‖
Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying even more closely
the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong; and he thought of what the family had
told him about the fright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so dark, but
did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had so
belied the frantic note of little more than a week before.
―I was coming to that,‖ the host replied. ―You must know, I am in a very bad state of nerves,
and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As I have told you often, I am on the edge
of great matters; and the bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man
might well be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for long. I was a dunce
to have that guard and stick at home; for having gone this far, my place is here. I am not well
spoke of by my prying neighbours, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what
they say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly. Have the
goodness to wait six months, and I‘ll shew you what will pay your patience well.
―You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books, and
I‘ll leave you to judge the importance of what I can give to history, philosophy, and the arts by
reason of the doors I have access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping
Toms came and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very imperfectly to have a
part of it. This time nothing must happen, and least of all through any idiot fears of my own.
Pray forget all I writ you, Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a man of
fine parts, and I owe him an apology for anything ill I have said of him. I wish I had no need to
spare him, but there were things he had to do elsewhere. His zeal is equal to mine in all those
matters, and I suppose that when I feared the work I feared him too as my greatest helper in
it.‖
Ward paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt almost foolish in the
face of this calm repudiation of the letter; and yet there clung to him the fact that while the
present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been tragic
in its naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew. Willett now tried to turn the talk
on early matters, and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar
mood; but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the same with
all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles Ward‘s store of mental images, mainly
those touching modern times and his own personal life, had been unaccountably expunged;
whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound
subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual. The youth‘s intimate
knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy, and he tried his best to hide it. When
Willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed
by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess,
and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by.
It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff‘s wig fell off as he leaned
over at the play in Mr. Douglass‘ Histrionick Academy in King Street on the eleventh of
February, 1762, which fell on a Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steele‘s
Conscious Lovers so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed the
theatre a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabin‘s Boston coach was ―damn‘d uncomfortable‖ old
letters may well have told; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of
Epenetus Olney‘s new signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his
tavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all
the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?
Ward, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and personal topics he waved
aside quite summarily, whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom.
What he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart
without the intention of returning. To this end he offered to shew Willett the entire house, and
at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked
sharply, but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have filled the
wide gaps on Ward‘s shelves at home, and that the meagre so-called ―laboratory‖ was the
flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just
where, it was impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not
name, Willett returned to town before evening and told the senior Ward everything which had
occurred. They agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that
nothing drastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as complete an
ignorance as her son‘s own strange typed notes would permit.
Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a surprise visit. Dr.
Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting
patiently for his return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a very
saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much like Willett‘s, save that
Charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way
into the hall and sent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing of
the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights had been dim, yet even so the
youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously. He had not spoken out loud at all,
averring that his throat was in very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there was a
quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind.
Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth‘s mental salvation, Mr.
Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford.
Pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean since
both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most rumours because people talked
more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure, and from all he heard he could tell
that young Ward‘s life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not
dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the nocturnal
comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation. Local
tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto, and
in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher
shops in the immediate neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were
quite absurd.
Then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of these things were
harder to pin down, but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual
nature positively existed, and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of course,
have come from the known cellar; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more
spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of Joseph Curwen‘s catacombs, and assuming
for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old
Curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture, Willett
and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention; and searched many times without
success for the door in the river-bank which old manuscripts mentioned. As to popular
opinions of the bungalow‘s various inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava Portuguese
was loathed, the bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared, and the pallid young scholar
disliked to a profound extent. During the last week or two Ward had obviously changed much,
abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers
on the few occasions that he ventured forth.
Such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over these Mr. Ward and
Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences. They strove to exercise deduction,
induction, and constructive imagination to their utmost extent; and to correlate every known
fact of Charles‘s later life, including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father,
with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old Joseph Curwen. They would
have given much for a glimpse of the papers Charles had found, for very clearly the key to the
youth‘s madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings.
4.
And yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Ward‘s or Dr. Willett‘s that the next move in this
singular case proceeded. The father and the physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow
too shapeless and intangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed
notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the month
with its customary financial adjustments, and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar
shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by
sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture
was a clumsy forgery, and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth
hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to
make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written characters at all except
with great difficulty; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his
recent letters, even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion.
What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone, for that was
nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which
one or two of them had caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man which
nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important
monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before. Something
was wrong; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be
no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, although none of
these men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the change in his language and
manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do
not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this combination of
hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent
some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of the
prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with
the senior Ward was imperative.
So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in Mr. Ward‘s office,
after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless
resignation. Willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques, and
compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note. Certainly, the change
was radical and profound, and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new
writing. It had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result
from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used. It was
strange—but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it was obvious that Charles was
insane. Of that there could be no doubt. And since it appeared unlikely that he could handle
his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer, something must quickly
be done toward his oversight and possible cure. It was then that the alienists were called in,
Drs. Peck and Waite of Providence and Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr.
Willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length in
the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books and papers of his were
left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast. After scanning this material
and examining the ominous note to Willett they all agreed that Charles Ward‘s studies had
been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect, and wished most heartily that
they could see his more intimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could
do, if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now reviewed the whole case with
febrile energy; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had
seen Charles find the Curwen documents, and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed
newspaper items, looking up the latter at the Journal office.
On Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, accompanied by Mr.
Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no concealment of their object and
questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was
inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious
laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from
recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat
from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his removal to other
quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as
apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement
had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern
by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the
normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said
to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as
mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or
laboratory beyond the visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the
house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to
nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr.
Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the
bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who
resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold
such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to
pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly
philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would
cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he
trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the
embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his
secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told
of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully
and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the
bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected
with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism,
the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed
of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with
terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on
his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never
been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to
any of the ―witch markings‖ reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings
in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-
trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and
which read: ―Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A.,
Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.‖ Ward‘s face,
too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For
above the young man‘s right eye was something which he had never previously noticed—a
small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and
perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain
stage of their occult careers.
While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on
all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the
family home. Willett had predicted that very little would be found, since any communications
of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the latter part of
March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen which gave both the doctor and the
father deep thought. It was in a very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the
effort of a foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as the
speech of young Ward himself. It read:
Kleinstrasse 11,

11th Feby. 1928.
Brother in Almousin-Metraton:—
I this day receiv‘d yr mention of what came up from the Salts I sent you. It was

Yogg-Sothoth Neblod Zin
Simon O.
To Mr. J. C. in
Providence.
Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of unrelieved insanity.
Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not
Charles Ward, had come to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild
reference and denunciation in the youth‘s last frantic letter. And what of this addressing of the
bearded and spectacled stranger as ―Mr. J. C.‖? There was no escaping the inference, but
there are limits to possible monstrosity. Who was ―Simon O.‖; the old man Ward had visited in
Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind there had been another
Simon O.—Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar
handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne
formulae which Charles had once shewn him. What horrors and mysteries, what
contradictions and contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to
harass Old Providence with her clustered spires and domes?
The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at
the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague
visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these
inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he
had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and
that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly
gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really
been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined
youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained.
Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange
correspondence of young Ward‘s companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred
eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely
unearthed an expatriated counterpart—perhaps one who had seen Orne‘s handwriting and
copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character‘s reincarnation. Allen himself was
perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of
the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-
headed doctors disposed of Willett‘s growing disquiet about Charles Ward‘s present
handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett
thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the
bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as
a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it
any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his
colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on
the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally
like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before
breaking the seal. This read as follows:

Nephren-Ka nai Hadoth
Edw: H.
For J. Curwen, Esq.
Providence.
But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not
refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the
fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles‘s frantic letter had
spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two
inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be
survivals or avatars of Curwen‘s old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the
reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained—or was at least advised to
entertain—murderous designs against a ―boy‖ who could scarcely be other than Charles
Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen
was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in
the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic
bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible
discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which
Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen‘s vacant room which had been identified
when the patient‘s belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any
effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son‘s old library,
and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the
place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard
whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something
different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which
centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the
intensity of a material emanation.
V. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm
1.
And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on
the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose
youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had
come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule.
There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion
with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least
two living men—and one other of whom they dared not think—were in absolute possession of
minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost
unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible
creatures—and Charles Ward as well—were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from
their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case.
They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the world‘s wisest and
greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the
consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.
A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones
were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what
was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond
anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found
unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had
evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered
together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of
preparing from even the most antique remains certain ―Essential Saltes‖ from which the shade
of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade,
and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught
successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not
always accurate.
Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things—
presences or voices of some sort—could be drawn down from unknown places as well as
from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably
evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles—what might one think of him? What forces
―outside the spheres‖ had reached him from Joseph Curwen‘s day and turned his mind on
forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had
talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of
Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper
item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had
summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and
those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and
hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen
with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single
talk with the man—if man it were—over the telephone!
What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer
Charles Ward‘s secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument—―must
have it red for three months‖—Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out?
The rifling of Ezra Weeden‘s ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet—whose mind had
planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then
the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of
Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind
of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was
daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the
detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young man‘s life. In
the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually
beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the
sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint
secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the
following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural
search and underground exploration.
The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten
o‘clock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the
disordered condition of Dr. Allen‘s room it was obvious that the detectives had been there
before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of
value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much
delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad
young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone
walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was
scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without
knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the
strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the
ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.
The doctor tried to put himself in Charles‘s place to see how a delver would be likely to start,
but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a
policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal,
trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at
last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once
before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he
finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay
a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited
zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed
the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious
air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.
In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him
with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from
the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett
hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite
his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a
band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul
air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian
hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an
iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must
originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.
2.
Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from
climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke
Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the
plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme
importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the
slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls
he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in
three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with
difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he
did not feel disposed to count any more.
It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not
meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused
anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential
loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen
on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and
it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast
his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by
numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the
middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped
flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine,
for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the
old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.
Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these
archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of
medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses
of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or
since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on
every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases
evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly
untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases
of Joseph Curwen‘s experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at
least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and
cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness.
Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy,
Willett lighted such as were ready for use.
In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or
library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of
the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece
well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the
noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot
of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which
might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so
long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a
task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and
bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough
deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus
postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Orne‘s and Hutchinson‘s; all of which he
took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.
At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of
old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so
many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been
when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the
papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the
entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Ward‘s
immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among
the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one
very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charles‘s normal writing,
which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there
were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in
a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though
of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous
imitation of the old wizard‘s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous
state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allen‘s there was not a trace. If
he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his
amanuensis.
In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that
Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel
columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called ―Dragon‘s Head‖ and
used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a
corresponding sign of ―Dragon‘s Tail‖ or descending node. The appearance of the whole was
something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no
more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables
and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings
from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as
follows—exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify—and the first one struck an odd
note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing
the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.
Y‘AI ‘NG‘NGAH,
YOG-SOTHOTH
H‘EE—L‘GEB
F‘AI THRODOG
UAAAH
OGTHROD AI‘F
GEB‘L—EE‘H
YOG-SOTHOTH
‘NGAH‘NG AI‘Y
ZHRO
So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the
doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had
secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to
examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more
systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted
room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly
with that dull and hideous whine.
The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and
ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph
Curwen‘s original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of
the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding
party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great
stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of
the Curwen outbuildings—perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows—
provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the
walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw
that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across
it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the
roof.
After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a
large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on
that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they
were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which
discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines.
Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated
by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and
wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These
cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent
now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.
3.
From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett‘s attention could no longer be diverted.
Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried
a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery.
Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his
beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular
intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement,
while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly
enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which
encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both
the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they
might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by
one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At
his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he
persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and
the doctor‘s head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the
exposed square yard of gaping blackness.
If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was
destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the
brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any
ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a
series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile
scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what
noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to
peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arm‘s
length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy,
moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness
and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and
frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty
to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he
looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of
that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors
had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells
whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern.
Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have
crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their
master had abandoned them unheeded.
But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the
dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how
a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a
man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of
symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinker‘s perspective and
whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the
protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity,
for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waite‘s
private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or
nervous coördination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the
bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic
no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet
he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean
wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He
tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the
frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter
blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of
yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a
light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory
he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the
shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the
slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.
What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar,
but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The
deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be
described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities
which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic
purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on
that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone—but Willett never
opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph
from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or
Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: ―Certainely, there
was Noth‘g butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. rais‘d upp from What he cou‘d gather
onlie a part of.‖
Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of
those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week
after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that
object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet
folk had ever seen or read about.
These words hummed in the doctor‘s mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous
stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lord‘s Prayer to himself; eventually
trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot
and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Ward‘s
underground library: ―Y’ai ’ng’ngah, Yog-Sothoth”, and so on till the final underlined ―Zhro”. It
seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-
lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly
air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or
reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he
detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised
caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he
collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.
Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the
hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the
pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not
come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain
him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen
electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willett‘s fingers felt a perforated slab he
trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it
would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his
progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and
lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness
without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to
his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew
that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party
Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged
from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from
a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young
Ward‘s secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp
which had brought him to safety.
4.
In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had
previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might
find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim
purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his
search for the hideous facts behind Charles Ward‘s bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern,
he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches,
and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever
hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and
nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but
he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near
the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious
archways would form the next goals of a logical search.
So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down
his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the
pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some
vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very
curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales
of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing
of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern
clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he
disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the
sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden
bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours
perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about
half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come,
and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering
three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong
apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments,
occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-
sought laboratory of Charles Ward—and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.
After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place
and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of
various reagents on the shelves that young Ward‘s dominant concern must have been with
some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific
ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really
rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter,
and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose
marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwen‘s farmhouse more than a century and a
half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwen‘s
occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor
proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small
storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages
of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher.
There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed
boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd
bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen‘s laboratory appliances. These
had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the
chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.
The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the
centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow
studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly
vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general
types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a
single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered
with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these
jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a
large wooden sign reading ―Custodes‖ above them, and all the Phalerons on the other,
correspondingly labelled with a sign reading ―Materia‖. Each of the jars or jugs, except some
on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number
apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the
moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and
experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough
generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a
single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull,
neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent
method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what
occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one,
and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual
feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand,
and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.
The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals
was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper.
―Custodes‖, ―Materia‖; that was the Latin for ―Guards‖ and ―Materials‖, respectively—and then
there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word ―Guards‖ before in
connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen
purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: ―There was no Neede
to keep the Guards in Shape and eat‘g off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in
Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.‖ What did this signify? But wait—was there not still
another reference to ―guards‖ in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading
the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar
Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that
dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard
betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible
colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives.
Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had ‗eaten their heads off‘, so that now
Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the ―salts‖ to which it
appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as
they could?
So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds,
presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish
incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were
not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his
hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves
with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the ―Materia‖—in the
myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too—and if not the salts of ―guards‖,
then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan
thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought
them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge
for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in
his frantic note, ‗all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and
the universe‘? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!
Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to
approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him
with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper
and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth,
that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in
twilight—and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a
moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air.
This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the
door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Ward‘s clothing
on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been
interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not
resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm
might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright
rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was
nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch
cloud which engulfed his patient.
The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single
chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised
after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of
savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled
cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful
Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set
down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked
carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when
interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that
crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:
―B. dy‘d not. Escap‘d into walls and founde Place below.
―Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.
―Rais‘d Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliver‘d.
―F. soughte to wipe out all know‘g howe to raise Those from Outside.‖
As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the
door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs
from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far
more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic
symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also
bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the
centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one
of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood
a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the
periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered
118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw
with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by
the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish
efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the
implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements
and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from
the jug of ―Materia‖, the two lekythoi from the ―Custodes‖ shelf, the robes, the formulae on the
walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses,
doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles
Ward—all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish
powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.
With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae
chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were
carved in Joseph Curwen‘s time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who
had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the
doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good
Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation
addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs.
Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the
forbidden pages of ―Eliphas Levi‖; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as
Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher
who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.
This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less
thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so
frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same;
with the ancient symbols of ―Dragon‘s Head‖ and ―Dragon‘s Tail‖ heading them as in Ward‘s
scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old
Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more
powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile
the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to
do. Where the script he had memorised began ―Y’ai ’ng’ngah, Yog-Sothoth”, this epigraph
started out as ―Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha”; which to his mind would seriously interfere
with the syllabification of the second word.
Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he
found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he
conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique
blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of
the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the
pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench
and the darkness.
―Y‘AI ‘NG‘NGAH,
YOG-SOTHOTH
H‘EE—L‘GEB
F‘AI THRODOG
UAAAH!”
But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The
lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall
nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out
the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely
stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre
contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had
lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity.
That powder—Great God! it had come from the shelf of ―Materia‖—what was it doing now,
and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting—the first of the pair—Dragon‘s
Head, ascending node—Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .
The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen,
heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. ―I say to
you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at
all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . .
Three Talkes with What was therein inhum’d. . . .‖ Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape
behind the parting smoke?
5.
Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain
sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle.
Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark
that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun
future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician
speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow
cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven o‘clock that portentous
morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and
had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious
but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and
opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he
shuddered and screamed, crying out, ―That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?” A
very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known
from the latter‘s boyhood.
In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willett‘s
clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and
only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was
taken to the hospital. The doctor‘s flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as
empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with
great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform
before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel
the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one.
Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was
no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed
the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks—no noisome well, no
world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench
and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale,
and clutched at the younger man. ―Yesterday,‖ he asked softly, ―did you see it here . . . and
smell it?‖ And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to
nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in
turn. ―Then I will tell you,‖ he said.
So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his
frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of
that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to
ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both
men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, ―Do you suppose it would be of any
use to dig?‖ The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer
when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss.
Again Mr. Ward asked, ―But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up
the hole somehow.‖ And Willett again let silence answer for him.
But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before
rising to leave, Dr. Willett‘s fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not
been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized
in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that
fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an
ordinary lead pencil—doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very
carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of
any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of
any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the
laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely
familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken
pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a
quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.
At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men
puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found
what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a
very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D.,
and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer
ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked
sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers
along Hadrian‘s crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might
remember—―Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d
retinendum. Tace ut potes.”—which may roughly be translated, ―Curwen must be killed. The
body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best
you are able.‖
Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they
lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially,
the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men
sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove
listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The
doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when
a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.
Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person;
and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready.
Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the
origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the ―Curwen‖ who must be
destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared
this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen,
moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of
Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now
from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that ―Curwen‖ must be killed
and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not
Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of
course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text
they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too
‗squeamish‘. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic
directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon
Charles Ward.
That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost
mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went
down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him
all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth
of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched
for a wincing on Charles‘s part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the
nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant
as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity,
and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as
useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this
affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents
doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, ―Damn ‘em, they do eat, but they don’t
need to! That‘s the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! D‘ye
know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would
he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard
aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed
things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-
seven years gone!”
But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against
his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of
the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youth‘s face, the doctor could not but feel a
kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn
down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish
dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread
his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement
that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in
the history of magic. ―But,‖ he added, ―had you but known the words to bring up that which I
had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. ‘Twas Number 118, and I conceive
you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in t‘other room. ‘Twas never raised by
me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.‖
Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had
arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Ward‘s face. ―It
came, and you be here alive?‖ As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst
free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with
a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a
letter he remembered. ―No. 118, you say? But don‘t forget that stones are all changed now in
nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!” And then, without warning, he
drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patient‘s eyes. He could have
wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.
All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the
resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his
delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him
on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get
to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor
told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr.
Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was
made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he
would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a
caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very
safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an
almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications
Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital
authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outré-looking
missive.
There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the
exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period,
Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current
crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed
that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and
had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of
Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it
alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the
Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-
regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery
alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not
this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett
maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as
well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal
with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives
sedulously not to think.
6.
The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the
detectives arrived. Allen‘s destruction or imprisonment—or Curwen‘s, if one might regard the
tacit claim to reincarnation as valid—he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he
communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were
downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because
of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older
servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.
At nine o‘clock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that
they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they
had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allen‘s source or present whereabouts;
but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts
concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural
being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false—
a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark
glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his
one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his
glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper,
in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was
very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in
his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the
preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the
actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the
bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the
sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy
cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know
him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight
scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives‘ search of Allen‘s room, it
yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed
writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen
manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished
catacombs of horror.
Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear
from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague,
mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses—
the crabbed Curwen penmanship—the old portrait and its tiny scar—and the altered youth in
the hospital with such a scar—that deep, hollow voice on the telephone—was it not of this
that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now
claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had
once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright
and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen—Allen—Ward—in what blasphemous and
abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable
resemblance of the picture to Charles—had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy
around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwen‘s
handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people—the
lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome
pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules
found in Willett‘s pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and ―salts‖ and
discoveries—whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing.
Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to
be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article
was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy
glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allen‘s room.
For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were
slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then
the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr.
Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief.
Allen—Ward—Curwen—it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy
called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to
last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too ‗squeamish‘, and why had his
destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely
obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared
think, said that ―Curwen‖ must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had
the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received—he had been nervous
all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered
boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no—had
he not cried out in terror as he entered his study—this very room? What had he found there?
Or wait—what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been
seen to go—was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure
which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?
Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough,
been a bad business. There had been noises—a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of
clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he
stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that
blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and
only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless,
for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr.
Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he
would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and
increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.
Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the
doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the
phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he
leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain
obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he
must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in
the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an
aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwen‘s features themselves
glanced slyly down from the painted panel.
Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening
suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour
later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The
father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments
passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened.
Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever
had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard
and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The
furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not
daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout
pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate.
Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds
and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and
Mr. Ward never saw what they were.
Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which
rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire.
Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again;
followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed
cries of Willett‘s were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable
hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and
acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous
inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Ward‘s head reeled, and the servants all clustered together
in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours
seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor
operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some
cupboard within, Willett made his appearance—sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the
cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open,
and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a
queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed
of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne
the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent
fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To
Mr. Ward he said, ―I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of
magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.‖
7.
That Dr. Willett‘s ―purgation‖ had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his
hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave
out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested
constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him
after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal
softness. Servants‘ imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been
excited by an item in Thursday‘s Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:
North End Ghouls Active Again
After a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the
North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the
same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a
moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or
pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the
figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light.
At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main
entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before
approach or capture was possible.
Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no
real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little
superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been
attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.
Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full
beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common
source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the
savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its
headstone violently shattered.
The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was
frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers
seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar
nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang
of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.
All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself
for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the
next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward
had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports
and its sinister ―purgation‖, but he found something calming about the doctor‘s letter in spite of
the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.
―10 Barnes St.,
Providence, R.I.,
April 12, 1928.
―Dear Theodore:—I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going
to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through
(for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of),
but I‘m afraid it won‘t set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very
conclusive it is.
―You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not
distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored.
It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charles‘s case, and almost
imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I
call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in
anyone‘s mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and
gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name.
I‘d advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you
need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm
down and brace up.
―So don‘t ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong,
but I‘ll tell you if it does. I don‘t think it will. There will be nothing more to worry
about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now—safer than you dream. You
need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of
the past as Joseph Curwen‘s picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel
certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will
never trouble you or yours.
―But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I
must tell you frankly that Charles‘s escape will not mean his restoration to you. He
has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle
physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him
again. Have only this consolation—that he was never a fiend or even truly a
madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and
of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know,
and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something
came out of those years to engulf him.
―And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For
there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charles‘s fate. In about a year, say, you
can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more.
You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west
of your father‘s and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place
of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The
ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew—of the
real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy—the real Charles
with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the
pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid
with his life for his ‗squeamishness‘.
―That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his
stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient
family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.
―With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and
resignation, I am ever
Sincerely your friend,
Marinus B. Willett‖
So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of
Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waite‘s private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though
making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open
the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctor‘s discovery of the crypt and his
monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that
both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new
element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctor‘s mask-like face a
terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since
the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place
to the ruthless and implacable avenger.
Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. ―More,‖ he said, ―has been
found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.‖
―Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?‖ was the ironic reply. It was
evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.
―No,‖ Willett slowly rejoined, ―this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr.
Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.‖
―Excellent,‖ commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, ―and I trust they
proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!‖
―They would become you very well,‖ came the even and studied response, ―as indeed they
seem to have done.”
As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there
was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:
―And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then
useful to be twofold?‖
―No,‖ said Willett gravely, ―again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks
duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called
him out of space.”
Ward now started violently. ―Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what d‘ye want with me?‖
The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective
answer.
―I have found,‖ he finally intoned, ―something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel
where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of
Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.‖
The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:
―Damn ye, who did ye tell—and who‘ll believe it was he after these full two months, with me
alive? What d‘ye mean to do?‖
Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the
patient with a gesture.
―I have told no one. This is no common case—it is a madness out of time and a horror from
beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or
grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might
not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know
that your accursed magic is true!
―I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double
and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your
detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern
things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard
and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you
resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the world‘s tombs, and at what you
planned afterward, and I know how you did it.
―You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it
was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and
hidden him. But you hadn‘t reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool,
Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didn‘t you think of the
speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasn‘t worked, you see, after all. You know
better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not
written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I
believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those
creatures wrote you once, ‗do not call up any that you can not put down‘. You were undone
once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all
again. Curwen, a man can‘t tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you
have woven will rise up to wipe you out.‖
But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him.
Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a
score of attendants to the doctor‘s rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient
ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice,
now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible
formula.
―PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .‖
But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and
even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and
measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye—magic
for magic—let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a
clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had
raised the writer of those minuscules—the cryptic invocation whose heading was the
Dragon‘s Tail, sign of the descending node—
―OGTHROD AI‘F
GEB‘L—EE‘H
YOG-SOTHOTH
‗NGAH‘NG AI‘Y
ZHRO!”
At the very first word from Willett‘s mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient
stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too
were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began.
It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut
his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.
But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled
the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward
was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that
what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been
no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay
scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.

The Colour Out of Space
(1927)
West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever
cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets
trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there are farms,
ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England
secrets in the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling
and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.
The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there. French-Canadians have
tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles have come and departed. It is not because of
anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined.
The place is not good for the imagination, and does not bring restful dreams at night. It must
be this which keeps the foreigners away, for old Ammi Pierce has never told them of anything
he recalls from the strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the
only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he dares to do this
because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around Arkham.
There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran straight where the
blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward
the south. Traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness,
and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new
reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below
blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the
strange days will be one with the deep‘s secrets; one with the hidden lore of old ocean, and all
the mystery of primal earth.
When I went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me the place was
evil. They told me this in Arkham, and because that is a very old town full of witch legends I
thought the evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through
centuries. The name ―blasted heath‖ seemed to me very odd and theatrical, and I wondered
how it had come into the folklore of a Puritan people. Then I saw that dark westward tangle of
glens and slopes for myself, and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own elder mystery.
It was morning when I saw it, but shadow lurked always there. The trees grew too thickly, and
their trunks were too big for any healthy New England wood. There was too much silence in
the dim alleys between them, and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of
infinite years of decay.
In the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were little hillside farms;
sometimes with all the buildings standing, sometimes with only one or two, and sometimes
with only a lone chimney or fast-filling cellar. Weeds and briers reigned, and furtive wild things
rustled in the undergrowth. Upon everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression; a
touch of the unreal and the grotesque, as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro
were awry. I did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay, for this was no region to sleep
in. It was too much like a landscape of Salvator Rosa; too much like some forbidden woodcut
in a tale of terror.
But even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath. I knew it the moment I came upon it at
the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other name could fit such a thing, or any other thing fit
such a name. It was as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one particular
region. It must, I thought as I viewed it, be the outcome of a fire; but why had nothing new
ever grown over those five acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great
spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields? It lay largely to the north of the ancient road line,
but encroached a little on the other side. I felt an odd reluctance about approaching, and did
so at last only because my business took me through and past it. There was no vegetation of
any kind on that broad expanse, but only a fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever
to blow about. The trees near it were sickly and stunted, and many dead trunks stood or lay
rotting at the rim. As I walked hurriedly by I saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old
chimney and cellar on my right, and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose
stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight. Even the long, dark
woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast, and I marvelled no more at the
frightened whispers of Arkham people. There had been no house or ruin near; even in the old
days the place must have been lonely and remote. And at twilight, dreading to repass that
ominous spot, I walked circuitously back to the town by the curving road on the south. I
vaguely wished some clouds would gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids
above had crept into my soul.
In the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath, and what was meant by
that phrase ―strange days‖ which so many evasively muttered. I could not, however, get any
good answers, except that all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was
not a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had
happened in the ‘eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be
exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce‘s crazy tales, I
sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering
cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was a fearsomely archaic place, and
had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too
long. Only with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly
to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had expected; but
his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem
very worn and dismal. Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned
a matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the district.
He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and before I knew it had
grasped quite as much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was not like
other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be. From him there were
no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there
would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all
that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed
all his life. They were better under water now—better under water since the strange days. And
with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right
forefinger began to point shakily and impressively.
It was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped and whispered on I
shivered again and again despite the summer day. Often I had to recall the speaker from
ramblings, piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of
professors‘ talk, or bridge over gaps where his sense of logic and continuity broke down.
When he was done I did not wonder that his mind had snapped a trifle, or that the folk of
Arkham would not speak much of the blasted heath. I hurried back before sunset to my hotel,
unwilling to have the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned to
Boston to give up my position. I could not go into that dim chaos of old forest and slope again,
or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black well yawned deep beside the
tumbled bricks and stones. The reservoir will soon be built now, and all those elder secrets
will be safe forever under watery fathoms. But even then I do not believe I would like to visit
that country by night—at least, not when the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me
to drink the new city water of Arkham.
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there had been no wild
legends at all since the witch trials, and even then these western woods were not feared half
so much as the small island in the Miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious
stone altar older than the Indians. These were not haunted woods, and their fantastic dusk
was never terrible till the strange days. Then there had come that white noontide cloud, that
string of explosions in the air, and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood. And by
night all Arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in the
ground beside the well at the Nahum Gardner place. That was the house which had stood
where the blasted heath was to come—the trim white Nahum Gardner house amidst its fertile
gardens and orchards.
Nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone, and had dropped in at Ammi Pierce‘s
on the way. Ammi was forty then, and all the queer things were fixed very strongly in his mind.
He and his wife had gone with the three professors from Miskatonic University who hastened
out the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space, and had wondered
why Nahum had called it so large the day before. It had shrunk, Nahum said as he pointed
out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic well-
sweep in his front yard; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink. Its heat
lingered persistently, and Nahum declared it had glowed faintly in the night. The professors
tried it with a geologist‘s hammer and found it was oddly soft. It was, in truth, so soft as to be
almost plastic; and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college
for testing. They took it in an old pail borrowed from Nahum‘s kitchen, for even the small piece
refused to grow cool. On the trip back they stopped at Ammi‘s to rest, and seemed thoughtful
when Mrs. Pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the bottom of
the pail. Truly, it was not large, but perhaps they had taken less than they thought.
The day after that—all this was in June of ‘82—the professors had trooped out again in a
great excitement. As they passed Ammi‘s they told him what queer things the specimen had
done, and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker. The beaker had
gone, too, and the wise men talked of the strange stone‘s affinity for silicon. It had acted quite
unbelievably in that well-ordered laboratory; doing nothing at all and shewing no occluded
gases when heated on charcoal, being wholly negative in the borax bead, and soon proving
itself absolutely non-volatile at any producible temperature, including that of the oxy-hydrogen
blowpipe. On an anvil it appeared highly malleable, and in the dark its luminosity was very
marked. Stubbornly refusing to grow cool, it soon had the college in a state of real excitement;
and when upon heating before the spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known
colours of the normal spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre
optical properties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced
by the unknown.
Hot as it was, they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents. Water did nothing.
Hydrochloric acid was the same. Nitric acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered
against its torrid invulnerability. Ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things, but recognised
some solvents as I mentioned them in the usual order of use. There were ammonia and
caustic soda, alcohol and ether, nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others; but
although the weight grew steadily less as time passed, and the fragment seemed to be
slightly cooling, there was no change in the solvents to shew that they had attacked the
substance at all. It was a metal, though, beyond a doubt. It was magnetic, for one thing; and
after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the Widmannstätten
figures found on meteoric iron. When the cooling had grown very considerable, the testing
was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker that they left all the chips made of the
original fragment during the work. The next morning both chips and beaker were gone without
trace, and only a charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been.
All this the professors told Ammi as they paused at his door, and once more he went with
them to see the stony messenger from the stars, though this time his wife did not accompany
him. It had now most certainly shrunk, and even the sober professors could not doubt the
truth of what they saw. All around the dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space,
except where the earth had caved in; and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the
day before, it was now scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its surface
curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel. They gouged
deeply this time, and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing
was not quite homogeneous.
They had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule imbedded in the
substance. The colour, which resembled some of the bands in the meteor‘s strange spectrum,
was almost impossible to describe; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all.
Its texture was glossy, and upon tapping it appeared to promise both brittleness and
hollowness. One of the professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer, and it burst with a
nervous little pop. Nothing was emitted, and all trace of the thing vanished with the
puncturing. It left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across, and all thought it
probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing substance wasted away.
Conjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by drilling, the seekers
left again with their new specimen—which proved, however, as baffling in the laboratory as its
predecessor had been. Aside from being almost plastic, having heat, magnetism, and slight
luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful acids, possessing an unknown spectrum, wasting away
in air, and attacking silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented no
identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the college scientists were forced
to own that they could not place it. It was nothing of this earth, but a piece of the great
outside; and as such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws.
That night there was a thunderstorm, and when the professors went out to Nahum‘s the next
day they met with a bitter disappointment. The stone, magnetic as it had been, must have had
some peculiar electrical property; for it had ―drawn the lightning‖, as Nahum said, with a
singular persistence. Six times within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in
the front yard, and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient
well-sweep, half-choked with caved-in earth. Digging had borne no fruit, and the scientists
verified the fact of the utter vanishment. The failure was total; so that nothing was left to do
but go back to the laboratory and test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in
lead. That fragment lasted a week, at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of
it. When it had gone, no residue was left behind, and in time the professors felt scarcely sure
they had indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside;
that lone, weird message from other universes and other realms of matter, force, and entity.
As was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate sponsoring,
and sent reporters to talk with Nahum Gardner and his family. At least one Boston daily also
sent a scribe, and Nahum quickly became a kind of local celebrity. He was a lean, genial
person of about fifty, living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the
valley. He and Ammi exchanged visits frequently, as did their wives; and Ammi had nothing
but praise for him after all these years. He seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had
attracted, and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks. That July and August
were hot, and Nahum worked hard at his haying in the ten-acre pasture across Chapman‘s
Brook; his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between. The labour tired him
more than it had in other years, and he felt that age was beginning to tell on him.
Then fell the time of fruit and harvest. The pears and apples slowly ripened, and Nahum
vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before. The fruit was growing to
phenomenal size and unwonted gloss, and in such abundance that extra barrels were
ordered to handle the future crop. But with the ripening came sore disappointment; for of all
that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit to eat. Into the fine
flavour of the pears and apples had crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even
the smallest of bites induced a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and tomatoes,
and Nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to connect events, he declared that
the meteorite had poisoned the soil, and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in
the upland lot along the road.
Winter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than usual, and observed
that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his family, too, seemed to have grown taciturn;
and were far from steady in their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events
of the countryside. For this reserve or melancholy no cause could be found, though all the
household confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum
himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about
certain footprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints of red squirrels, white rabbits,
and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed to see something not quite right about their
nature and arrangement. He was never specific, but appeared to think that they were not as
characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to
be. Ammi listened without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past Nahum‘s
house in his sleigh on the way back from Clark‘s Corners. There had been a moon, and a
rabbit had run across the road, and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than either Ammi or
his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away when brought up by a firm rein.
Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum‘s tales more respect, and wondered why the Gardner dogs
seemed so cowed and quivering every morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit
to bark.
In February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting woodchucks, and not far
from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar specimen. The proportions of its body seemed
slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an
expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were genuinely
frightened, and threw the thing away at once, so that only their grotesque tales of it ever
reached the people of the countryside. But the shying of the horses near Nahum‘s house had
now become an acknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend was
fast taking form.
People vowed that the snow melted faster around Nahum‘s than it did anywhere else, and
early in March there was an awed discussion in Potter‘s general store at Clark‘s Corners.
Stephen Rice had driven past Gardner‘s in the morning, and had noticed the skunk-cabbages
coming up through the mud by the woods across the road. Never were things of such size
seen before, and they held strange colours that could not be put into any words. Their shapes
were monstrous, and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck Stephen as wholly
unprecedented. That afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth, and
all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world. The bad fruit of the
fall before was freely mentioned, and it went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in
Nahum‘s ground. Of course it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from
the college had found that stone to be, several farmers spoke about the matter to them.
One day they paid Nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and folklore were very
conservative in what they inferred. The plants were certainly odd, but all skunk-cabbages are
more or less odd in shape and odour and hue. Perhaps some mineral element from the stone
had entered the soil, but it would soon be washed away. And as for the footprints and
frightened horses—of course this was mere country talk which such a phenomenon as the
aërolite would be certain to start. There was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of
wild gossip, for superstitious rustics will say and believe anything. And so all through the
strange days the professors stayed away in contempt. Only one of them, when given two
phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a year and a half later, recalled that the queer
colour of that skunk-cabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light shewn
by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope, and like the brittle globule found
imbedded in the stone from the abyss. The samples in this analysis case gave the same odd
bands at first, though later they lost the property.
The trees budded prematurely around Nahum‘s, and at night they swayed ominously in the
wind. Nahum‘s second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen, swore that they swayed also when
there was no wind; but even the gossips would not credit this. Certainly, however,
restlessness was in the air. The entire Gardner family developed the habit of stealthy
listening, though not for any sound which they could consciously name. The listening was,
indeed, rather a product of moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away.
Unfortunately such moments increased week by week, till it became common speech that
―something was wrong with all Nahum‘s folks‖. When the early saxifrage came out it had
another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunk-cabbage, but plainly related and
equally unknown to anyone who saw it. Nahum took some blossoms to Arkham and shewed
them to the editor of the Gazette, but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article
about them, in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule. It was a mistake
of Nahum‘s to tell a stolid city man about the way the great, overgrown mourning-cloak
butterflies behaved in connexion with these saxifrages.
April brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that disuse of the road past
Nahum‘s which led to its ultimate abandonment. It was the vegetation. All the orchard trees
blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent
pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the
proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in
the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some
diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth. The
Dutchman‘s breeches became a thing of sinister menace, and the bloodroots grew insolent in
their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners thought that most of the colours had a
sort of haunting familiarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the
meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing
with the land around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer‘s
strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything
now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard. The
shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of course; but it told on his wife more. The
boys were better off, being at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the
gossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most.
In May the insects came, and Nahum‘s place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling.
Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions, and their
nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience. The Gardners took to watching at night—
watching in all directions at random for something . . . they could not tell what. It was then that
they all owned that Thaddeus had been right about the trees. Mrs. Gardner was the next to
see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky.
The boughs surely moved, and there was no wind. It must be the sap. Strangeness had come
into everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum‘s family at all who made the next
discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid
windmill salesman from Bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends.
What he told in Arkham was given a short paragraph in the Gazette; and it was there that all
the farmers, Nahum included, saw it first. The night had been dark and the buggy-lamps faint,
but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the account must be Nahum‘s the
darkness had been less thick. A dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the
vegetation, grass, leaves, and blossoms alike, while at one moment a detached piece of the
phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barn.
The grass had so far seemed untouched, and the cows were freely pastured in the lot near
the house, but toward the end of May the milk began to be bad. Then Nahum had the cows
driven to the uplands, after which the trouble ceased. Not long after this the change in grass
and leaves became apparent to the eye. All the verdure was going grey, and was developing
a highly singular quality of brittleness. Ammi was now the only person who ever visited the
place, and his visits were becoming fewer and fewer. When school closed the Gardners were
virtually cut off from the world, and sometimes let Ammi do their errands in town. They were
failing curiously both physically and mentally, and no one was surprised when the news of
Mrs. Gardner‘s madness stole around.
It happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteor‘s fall, and the poor woman
screamed about things in the air which she could not describe. In her raving there was not a
single specific noun, but only verbs and pronouns. Things moved and changed and fluttered,
and ears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds. Something was taken away—she
was being drained of something—something was fastening itself on her that ought not to be—
someone must make it keep off—nothing was ever still in the night—the walls and windows
shifted. Nahum did not send her to the county asylum, but let her wander about the house as
long as she was harmless to herself and others. Even when her expression changed he did
nothing. But when the boys grew afraid of her, and Thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she
made faces at him, he decided to keep her locked in the attic. By July she had ceased to
speak and crawled on all fours, and before that month was over Nahum got the mad notion
that she was slightly luminous in the dark, as he now clearly saw was the case with the
nearby vegetation.
It was a little before this that the horses had stampeded. Something had aroused them in the
night, and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible. There seemed virtually
nothing to do to calm them, and when Nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like
frightened woodland deer. It took a week to track all four, and when found they were seen to
be quite useless and unmanageable. Something had snapped in their brains, and each one
had to be shot for its own good. Nahum borrowed a horse from Ammi for his haying, but found
it would not approach the barn. It shied, balked, and whinnied, and in the end he could do
nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own strength to get the heavy
wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching. And all the while the vegetation was
turning grey and brittle. Even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were greying now,
and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and tasteless. The asters and goldenrod
bloomed grey and distorted, and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were
such blasphemous-looking things that Nahum‘s oldest boy Zenas cut them down. The
strangely puffed insects died about that time, even the bees that had left their hives and taken
to the woods.
By September all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder, and Nahum feared
that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil. His wife now had spells of
terrific screaming, and he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension. They
shunned people now, and when school opened the boys did not go. But it was Ammi, on one
of his rare visits, who first realised that the well water was no longer good. It had an evil taste
that was not exactly foetid nor exactly salty, and Ammi advised his friend to dig another well
on higher ground to use till the soil was good again. Nahum, however, ignored the warning,
for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant things. He and the boys
continued to use the tainted supply, drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate their
meagre and ill-cooked meals and did their thankless and monotonous chores through the
aimless days. There was something of stolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half
in another world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom.
Thaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well. He had gone with a pail and had
come back empty-handed, shrieking and waving his arms, and sometimes lapsing into an
inane titter or a whisper about ―the moving colours down there‖. Two in one family was pretty
bad, but Nahum was very brave about it. He let the boy run about for a week until he began
stumbling and hurting himself, and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his
mother‘s. The way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very
terrible, especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some terrible language that was
not of earth. Merwin was getting frightfully imaginative, and his restlessness was worse after
the shutting away of the brother who had been his greatest playmate.
Almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced. Poultry turned
greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting. Hogs
grew inordinately fat, then suddenly began to undergo loathsome changes which no one
could explain. Their meat was of course useless, and Nahum was at his wit‘s end. No rural
veterinary would approach his place, and the city veterinary from Arkham was openly baffled.
The swine began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died, and their
eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for they had never
been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the cows. Certain areas or
sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed, and atrocious
collapses or disintegrations were common. In the last stages—and death was always the
result—there would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs. There
could be no question of poison, for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn.
No bites of prowling things could have brought the virus, for what live beast of earth can pass
through solid obstacles? It must be only natural disease—yet what disease could wreak such
results was beyond any mind‘s guessing. When the harvest came there was not an animal
surviving on the place, for the stock and poultry were dead and the dogs had run away. These
dogs, three in number, had all vanished one night and were never heard of again. The five
cats had left some time before, but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed
to be no mice, and only Mrs. Gardner had made pets of the graceful felines.
On the nineteenth of October Nahum staggered into Ammi‘s house with hideous news. The
death had come to poor Thaddeus in his attic room, and it had come in a way which could not
be told. Nahum had dug a grave in the railed family plot behind the farm, and had put therein
what he found. There could have been nothing from outside, for the small barred window and
locked door were intact; but it was much as it had been in the barn. Ammi and his wife
consoled the stricken man as best they could, but shuddered as they did so. Stark terror
seemed to cling round the Gardners and all they touched, and the very presence of one in the
house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable. Ammi accompanied Nahum
home with the greatest reluctance, and did what he might to calm the hysterical sobbing of
little Merwin. Zenas needed no calming. He had come of late to do nothing but stare into
space and obey what his father told him; and Ammi thought that his fate was very merciful.
Now and then Merwin‘s screams were answered faintly from the attic, and in response to an
inquiring look Nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble. When night approached,
Ammi managed to get away; for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when
the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without
wind. It was really lucky for Ammi that he was not more imaginative. Even as things were, his
mind was bent ever so slightly; but had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the
portents around him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac. In the twilight he hastened
home, the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his ears.
Three days later Nahum lurched into Ammi‘s kitchen in the early morning, and in the absence
of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more, while Mrs. Pierce listened in a
clutching fright. It was little Merwin this time. He was gone. He had gone out late at night with
a lantern and pail for water, and had never come back. He‘d been going to pieces for days,
and hardly knew what he was about. Screamed at everything. There had been a frantic shriek
from the yard then, but before the father could get to the door, the boy was gone. There was
no glow from the lantern he had taken, and of the child himself no trace. At the time Nahum
thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when dawn came, and the man had plodded
back from his all-night search of the woods and fields, he had found some very curious things
near the well. There was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had
certainly been the lantern; while a bent bail and twisted iron hoops beside it, both half-fused,
seemed to hint at the remnants of the pail. That was all. Nahum was past imagining, Mrs.
Pierce was blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could give no
guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling the people around, who
shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in telling the city people at Arkham who laughed at
everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and
creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted
Ammi to look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a judgment of some
sort; though he could not fancy what for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord‘s
ways so far as he knew.
For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about what might have
happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner place a visit. There was no smoke
from the great chimney, and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The
aspect of the whole farm was shocking—greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground,
vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables, and great bare trees clawing
up at the grey November sky with a studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had
come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after all. He
was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but perfectly conscious and able to
give simple orders to Zenas. The room was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the
host shouted huskily to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the
cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind
that came down the chimney. Presently Nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him
any more comfortable, and then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken
at last, and the hapless farmer‘s mind was proof against more sorrow.
Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing Zenas. ―In the
well—he lives in the well—‖ was all that the clouded father would say. Then there flashed
across the visitor‘s mind a sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry.
―Nabby? Why, here she is!‖ was the surprised response of poor Nahum, and Ammi soon saw
that he must search for himself. Leaving the harmless babbler on the couch, he took the keys
from their nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic. It was very close
and noisome up there, and no sound could be heard from any direction. Of the four doors in
sight, only one was locked, and on this he tried various keys on the ring he had taken. The
third key proved the right one, and after some fumbling Ammi threw open the low white door.
It was quite dark inside, for the window was small and half-obscured by the crude wooden
bars; and Ammi could see nothing at all on the wide-planked floor. The stench was beyond
enduring, and before proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with his
lungs filled with breathable air. When he did enter he saw something dark in the corner, and
upon seeing it more clearly he screamed outright. While he screamed he thought a
momentary cloud eclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by
some hateful current of vapour. Strange colours danced before his eyes; and had not a
present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor that the
geologist‘s hammer had shattered, and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the
spring. As it was he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him, and
which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young Thaddeus and the livestock. But
the terrible thing about this horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it
continued to crumble.
Ammi would give me no added particulars to this scene, but the shape in the corner does not
reappear in his tale as a moving object. There are things which cannot be mentioned, and
what is done in common humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law. I gathered that no
moving thing was left in that attic room, and that to leave anything capable of motion there
would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment.
Anyone but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad, but Ammi walked conscious
through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him. There would be Nahum
to deal with now; he must be fed and tended, and removed to some place where he could be
cared for.
Commencing his descent of the dark stairs, Ammi heard a thud below him. He even thought a
scream had been suddenly choked off, and recalled nervously the clammy vapour which had
brushed by him in that frightful room above. What presence had his cry and entry started up?
Halted by some vague fear, he heard still further sounds below. Indubitably there was a sort of
heavy dragging, and a most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species
of suction. With an associative sense goaded to feverish heights, he thought unaccountably of
what he had seen upstairs. Good God! What eldritch dream-world was this into which he had
blundered? He dared move neither backward nor forward, but stood there trembling at the
black curve of the boxed-in staircase. Every trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain. The
sounds, the sense of dread expectancy, the darkness, the steepness of the narrow steps—
and merciful heaven! . . . the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight;
steps, sides, exposed laths, and beams alike!
Then there burst forth a frantic whinny from Ammi‘s horse outside, followed at once by a
clatter which told of a frenzied runaway. In another moment horse and buggy had gone
beyond earshot, leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them.
But that was not all. There had been another sound out there. A sort of liquid splash—water—
it must have been the well. He had left Hero untied near it, and a buggy-wheel must have
brushed the coping and knocked in a stone. And still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that
detestably ancient woodwork. God! how old the house was! Most of it built before 1670, and
the gambrel roof not later than 1730.
A feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly, and Ammi‘s grip tightened
on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose. Slowly nerving himself, he
finished his descent and walked boldly toward the kitchen. But he did not complete the walk,
because what he sought was no longer there. It had come to meet him, and it was still alive
after a fashion. Whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external force,
Ammi could not say; but the death had been at it. Everything had happened in the last half-
hour, but collapse, greying, and disintegration were already far advanced. There was a
horrible brittleness, and dry fragments were scaling off. Ammi could not touch it, but looked
horrifiedly into the distorted parody that had been a face. ―What was it, Nahum—what was it?‖
he whispered, and the cleft, bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answer.
―Nothin‘ . . . nothin‘ . . . the colour . . . it burns . . . cold an‘ wet . . . but it burns . . . it lived in the
well . . . I seen it . . . a kind o‘ smoke . . . jest like the flowers last spring . . . the well shone at
night . . . Thad an‘ Mernie an‘ Zenas . . . everything alive . . . suckin‘ the life out of everything .
. . in that stone . . . it must a‘ come in that stone . . . pizened the whole place . . . dun‘t know
what it wants . . . that round thing them men from the college dug outen the stone . . . they
smashed it . . . it was that same colour . . . jest the same, like the flowers an‘ plants . . . must
a‘ ben more of ‘em . . . seeds . . . seeds . . . they growed . . . I seen it the fust time this week .
. . must a‘ got strong on Zenas . . . he was a big boy, full o‘ life . . . it beats down your mind an‘
then gits ye . . . burns ye up . . . in the well water . . . you was right about that . . . evil water . .
. Zenas never come back from the well . . . can‘t git away . . . draws ye . . . ye know summ‘at‘s

Ammi? . . . my head‘s no good . . . dun‘t know how long senct I fed her . . . it‘ll git her ef we

. . . an‘ it burns an‘ sucks . . . it come from some place whar things ain‘t as they is here . . .
one o‘ them professors said so . . . he was right . . . look out, Ammi, it‘ll do suthin‘ more . . .
sucks the life out. . . .‖
But that was all. That which spoke could speak no more because it had completely caved in.
Ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and reeled out the back door into the
fields. He climbed the slope to the ten-acre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and
the woods. He could not pass that well from which his horse had run away. He had looked at
it through the window, and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim. Then the
lurching buggy had not dislodged anything after all—the splash had been something else—
something which went into the well after it had done with poor Nahum. . . .
When Ammi reached his house the horse and buggy had arrived before him and thrown his
wife into fits of anxiety. Reassuring her without explanations, he set out at once for Arkham
and notified the authorities that the Gardner family was no more. He indulged in no details,
but merely told of the deaths of Nahum and Nabby, that of Thaddeus being already known,
and mentioned that the cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the
livestock. He also stated that Merwin and Zenas had disappeared. There was considerable
questioning at the police station, and in the end Ammi was compelled to take three officers to
the Gardner farm, together with the coroner, the medical examiner, and the veterinary who
had treated the diseased animals. He went much against his will, for the afternoon was
advancing and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place, but it was some comfort to
have so many people with him.
The six men drove out in a democrat-wagon, following Ammi‘s buggy, and arrived at the pest-
ridden farmhouse about four o‘clock. Used as the officers were to gruesome experiences, not
one remained unmoved at what was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth
on the floor below. The whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough,
but those two crumbling objects were beyond all bounds. No one could look long at them, and
even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine. Specimens could be
analysed, of course, so he busied himself in obtaining them—and here it develops that a very
puzzling aftermath occurred at the college laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally
taken. Under the spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum, in which many
of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in the
previous year. The property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month, the dust thereafter
consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonates.
Ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant to do anything
then and there. It was getting toward sunset, and he was anxious to be away. But he could
not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the great sweep, and when a detective
questioned him he admitted that Nahum had feared something down there—so much so that
he had never even thought of searching it for Merwin or Zenas. After that nothing would do
but that they empty and explore the well immediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while pail
after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside. The men
sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their noses against the foetor they were
uncovering. It was not so long a job as they had feared it would be, since the water was
phenomenally low. There is no need to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin and
Zenas were both there, in part, though the vestiges were mainly skeletal. There were also a
small deer and a large dog in about the same state, and a number of bones of smaller
animals. The ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a
man who descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink the wooden
shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid obstruction.
Twilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house. Then, when it was seen
that nothing further could be gained from the well, everyone went indoors and conferred in the
ancient sitting-room while the intermittent light of a spectral half-moon played wanly on the
grey desolation outside. The men were frankly nonplussed by the entire case, and could find
no convincing common element to link the strange vegetable conditions, the unknown
disease of livestock and humans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the
tainted well. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not believe that
anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt the meteor had poisoned the soil, but
the illness of persons and animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another
matter. Was it the well water? Very possibly. It might be a good idea to analyse it. But what
peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well? Their deeds were so
similar—and the fragments shewed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death.
Why was everything so grey and brittle?
It was the coroner, seated near a window overlooking the yard, who first noticed the glow
about the well. Night had fully set in, and all the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous
with more than the fitful moonbeams; but this new glow was something definite and distinct,
and appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight, giving dull
reflections in the little ground pools where the water had been emptied. It had a very queer
colour, and as all the men clustered round the window Ammi gave a violent start. For this
strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue. He had seen that colour
before, and feared to think what it might mean. He had seen it in the nasty brittle globule in
that aërolite two summers ago, had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime, and had
thought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small barred window of
that terrible attic room where nameless things had happened. It had flashed there a second,
and a clammy and hateful current of vapour had brushed past him—and then poor Nahum
had been taken by something of that colour. He had said so at the last—said it was the
globule and the plants. After that had come the runaway in the yard and the splash in the
well—and now that well was belching forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same
daemoniac tint.
It does credit to the alertness of Ammi‘s mind that he puzzled even at that tense moment over
a point which was essentially scientific. He could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same
impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime, against a window opening on the morning
sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and
blasted landscape. It wasn‘t right—it was against Nature—and he thought of those terrible last
words of his stricken friend, ―It come from some place whar things ain‘t as they is here . . .
one o‘ them professors said so. . . .‖
All three horses outside, tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road, were now neighing
and pawing frantically. The wagon driver started for the door to do something, but Ammi laid a
shaky hand on his shoulder. ―Dun‘t go out thar,‖ he whispered. ―They‘s more to this nor what
we know. Nahum said somethin‘ lived in the well that sucks your life out. He said it must be
some‘at growed from a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago
June. Sucks an‘ burns, he said, an‘ is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now, that ye
can hardly see an‘ can‘t tell what it is. Nahum thought it feeds on everything livin‘ an‘ gits
stronger all the time. He said he seen it this last week. It must be somethin‘ from away off in
the sky like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was. The way it‘s made
an‘ the way it works ain‘t like no way o‘ God‘s world. It‘s some‘at from beyond.‖
So the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the hitched
horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy. It was truly an awful moment; with terror in
that ancient and accursed house itself, four monstrous sets of fragments—two from the house
and two from the well—in the woodshed behind, and that shaft of unknown and unholy
iridescence from the slimy depths in front. Ammi had restrained the driver on impulse,
forgetting how uninjured he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in
the attic room, but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did. No one will ever know
what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so far hurt any
human of unweakened mind, there is no telling what it might not have done at that last
moment, and with its seemingly increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was
soon to display beneath the half-clouded moonlit sky.
All at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp gasp. The others looked at
him, and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had
been suddenly arrested. There was no need for words. What had been disputed in country
gossip was disputable no longer, and it is because of the thing which every man of that party
agreed in whispering later on that the strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is
necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did arise not
long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even the dry tips of the lingering hedge-
mustard, grey and blighted, and the fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were
unstirred. And yet amid that tense, godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the
yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive
and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if
jerked by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and
struggling below the black roots.
Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon,
and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily. At this there was a general
cry; muffled with awe, but husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had not
faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw
wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance,
tipping each bough like the fire of St. Elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles‘
heads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a glutted swarm of
corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh; and its colour was that
same nameless intrusion which Ammi had come to recognise and dread. All the while the
shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter, bringing to the
minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image
their conscious minds could form. It was no longer shining out, it was pouring out; and as the
shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the sky.
The veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra bar across it.
Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for lack of a controllable voice when he wished
to draw notice to the growing luminosity of the trees. The neighing and stamping of the horses
had become utterly frightful, but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured
forth for any earthly reward. With the moments the shining of the trees increased, while their
restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood of the well-
sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly pointed to some wooden sheds
and bee-hives near the stone wall on the west. They were commencing to shine, too, though
the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so far unaffected. Then there was a wild
commotion and clopping in the road, and as Ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they
realised that the span of frantic greys had broke their sapling and run off with the democrat-
wagon.
The shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers were exchanged. ―It
spreads on everything organic that‘s been around here,‖ muttered the medical examiner. No
one replied, but the man who had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have
stirred up something intangible. ―It was awful,‖ he added. ―There was no bottom at all. Just
ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking under there.‖ Ammi‘s horse still pawed
and screamed deafeningly in the road outside, and nearly drowned its owner‘s faint quaver as
he mumbled his formless reflections. ―It come from that stone . . . it growed down thar . . . it
got everything livin‘ . . . it fed itself on ‘em, mind and body . . . Thad an‘ Mernie, Zenas an‘
Nabby . . . Nahum was the last . . . they all drunk the water . . . it got strong on ‘em . . . it come
from beyond, whar things ain‘t like they be here . . . now it‘s goin‘ home. . . .‖
At this point, as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and began to weave
itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator later described differently, there
came from poor tethered Hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a
horse. Every person in that low-pitched sitting room stopped his ears, and Ammi turned away
from the window in horror and nausea. Words could not convey it—when Ammi looked out
again the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts
of the buggy. That was the last of Hero till they buried him next day. But the present was no
time to mourn, for almost at this instant a detective silently called attention to something
terrible in the very room with them. In the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint
phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment. It glowed on the broad-planked
floor and the fragment of rag carpet, and shimmered over the sashes of the small-paned
windows. It ran up and down the exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the shelf and
mantel, and infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it strengthen, and at last it
was very plain that healthy living things must leave that house.
Ammi shewed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the ten-acre pasture.
They walked and stumbled as in a dream, and did not dare look back till they were far away
on the high ground. They were glad of the path, for they could not have gone the front way, by
that well. It was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds, and those shining orchard
trees with their gnarled, fiendish contours; but thank heaven the branches did their worst
twisting high up. The moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic
bridge over Chapman‘s Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open meadows.
When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place at the bottom they
saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour;
trees, buildings, and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal
grey brittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues of foul flame, and
lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the
house, barn, and sheds. It was a scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned
that riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison
from the well—seething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, straining, and malignly
bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognisable chromaticism.
Then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or
meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in
the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out. No watcher can ever forget that sight, and
Ammi stared blankly at the stars of Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the others, where the
unknown colour had melted into the Milky Way. But his gaze was the next moment called
swiftly to earth by the crackling in the valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and
crackling, and not an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the outcome was
the same, for in one feverish, kaleidoscopic instant there burst up from that doomed and
accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance; blurring
the glance of the few who saw it, and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of
such coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown. Through quickly
re-closing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished, and in another second
they had vanished too. Behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not
return, and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black, frore gusts
from interstellar space. It shrieked and howled, and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a
mad cosmic frenzy, till soon the trembling party realised it would be no use waiting for the
moon to shew what was left down there at Nahum‘s.
Too awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back toward Arkham by the
north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows, and begged them to see him inside his own
kitchen, instead of keeping straight on to town. He did not wish to cross the nighted, wind-
whipped woods alone to his home on the main road. For he had had an added shock that the
others were spared, and was crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention
for many years to come. As the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set
their faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed valley of
desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred friend. And from that stricken, far-away spot he
had seen something feebly rise, only to sink down again upon the place from which the great
shapeless horror had shot into the sky. It was just a colour—but not any colour of our earth or
heavens. And because Ammi recognised that colour, and knew that this last faint remnant
must still lurk down there in the well, he has never been quite right since.
Ammi would never go near the place again. It is over half a century now since the horror
happened, but he has never been there, and will be glad when the new reservoir blots it out. I
shall be glad, too, for I do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of
that abandoned well I passed. I hope the water will always be very deep—but even so, I shall
never drink it. I do not think I shall visit the Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who
had been with Ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were not
any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the cellar, some mineral and
metallic litter here and there, and the rim of that nefandous well. Save for Ammi‘s dead horse,
which they towed away and buried, and the buggy which they shortly returned to him,
everything that had ever been living had gone. Five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert
remained, nor has anything ever grown there since. To this day it sprawls open to the sky like
a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse
it in spite of the rural tales have named it ―the blasted heath‖.
The rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could
be interested enough to analyse the water from that disused well, or the grey dust that no
wind seems ever to disperse. Botanists, too, ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of
that spot, for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreading—little by
little, perhaps an inch a year. People say the colour of the neighbouring herbage is not quite
right in the spring, and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow. Snow never
seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere. Horses—the few that are left in
this motor age—grow skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs too
near the splotch of greyish dust.
They say the mental influences are very bad, too. Numbers went queer in the years after
Nahum‘s taking, and always they lacked the power to get away. Then the stronger-minded
folk all left the region, and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads.
They could not stay, though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild,
weird stores of whispered magic have given them. Their dreams at night, they protest, are
very horrible in that grotesque country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to
stir a morbid fancy. No traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep
ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as
of the eye. I myself am curious about the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before
Ammi told me his tale. When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would gather,
for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul.
Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know—that is all. There was no one but Ammi to
question; for Arkham people will not talk about the strange days, and all three professors who
saw the aërolite and its coloured globule are dead. There were other globules—depend upon
that. One must have fed itself and escaped, and probably there was another which was too
late. No doubt it is still down the well—I know there was something wrong with the sunlight I
saw above that miasmal brink. The rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year, so perhaps
there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever daemon hatchling is there, it
must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread. Is it fastened to the roots of
those trees that claw the air? One of the current Arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and
move as they ought not to do at night.
What it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing Ammi described would be
called a gas, but this gas obeyed laws that are not of our cosmos. This was no fruit of such
worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories.
This was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure
or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour out of space—a frightful messenger from
unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere
existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open
before our frenzied eyes.
I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think his tale was all a freak of
madness as the townfolk had forewarned. Something terrible came to the hills and valleys on
that meteor, and something terrible—though I know not in what proportion—still remains. I
shall be glad to see the water come. Meanwhile I hope nothing will happen to Ammi. He saw
so much of the thing—and its influence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to
move away? How clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum‘s—―can‘t git away . . .
draws ye . . . ye know summ‘at‘s comin‘, but ‘tain‘t no use. . . .‖ Ammi is such a good old
man—when the reservoir gang gets to work I must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp
watch on him. I would hate to think of him as the grey, twisted, brittle monstrosity which
persists more and more in troubling my sleep.

The Very Old Folk
(1927)
Thursday
[November 3, 1927]
Dear Melmoth:–
. . . So you are busy delving into the shady past of that insufferable young Asiatic Varius
Avitus Bassianus? Ugh! There are few persons I loathe more than that cursed little Syrian rat!
I have myself been carried back to Roman times by my recent perusal of James Rhoades‘
Æneid, a translation never before read by me, and more faithful to P. Maro than any other
versified version I have ever seen—including that of my late uncle Dr. Clark, which did not
attain publication. This Virgilian diversion, together with the spectral thoughts incident to All
Hallows‘ Eve with its Witch-Sabbaths on the hills, produced in me last Monday night a Roman
dream of such supernal clearness and vividness, and such titanic adumbrations of hidden
horror, that I verily believe I shall some day employ it in fiction. Roman dreams were no
uncommon features of my youth—I used to follow the Divine Julius all over Gallia as a
Tribunus Militum o‘nights—but I had so long ceased to experience them, that the present one
impressed me with extraordinary force.
It was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town of Pompelo, at the foot of
the Pyrenees in Hispania Citerior. The year must have been in the late republic, for the
province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a prætorian legate of Augustus,
and the day was the first before the Kalends of November. The hills rose scarlet and gold to
the north of the little town, and the westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude
new stone and plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some
distance to the east. Groups of citizens—broad-browed Roman colonists and coarse-haired
Romanised natives, together with obvious hybrids of the two strains, alike clad in cheap
woollen togas—and sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarse-mantled, black-bearded
tribesmen of the circumambient Vascones—all thronged the few paved streets and forum;
moved by some vague and ill-defined uneasiness.
I myself had just alighted from a litter, which the Illyrian bearers seemed to have brought in
some haste from Calagurris, across the Iberus to the southward. It appeared that I was a
provincial quæstor named L. Cælius Rufus, and that I had been summoned by the proconsul,
P. Scribonius Libo, who had come from Tarraco some days before. The soldiers were the fifth
cohort of the XIIth legion, under the military tribune Sex. Asellius; and the legatus of the whole
region, Cn. Balbutius, had also come from Calagurris, where the permanent station was.
The cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills. All the townsfolk were
frightened, and had begged the presence of a cohort from Calagurris. It was the Terrible
Season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful
ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns. They were the very old folk who dwelt
higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the Vascones could not understand.
One seldom saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint-eyed
messengers (who looked like Scythians) to trade with the merchants by means of gestures,
and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks, their howlings and
altar-fires throwing terror into the villages. Always the same—the night before the Kalends of
Maius and the night before the Kalends of November. Townsfolk would disappear just before
these nights, and would never be heard of again. And there were whispers that the native
shepherds and farmers were not ill-disposed toward the very old folk—that more than one
thatched hut was vacant before midnight on the two hideous Sabbaths.
This year the horror was very great, for the people knew that the wrath of the very old folk
was upon Pompelo. Three months previously five of the little squint-eyed traders had come
down from the hills, and in a market brawl three of them had been killed. The remaining two
had gone back wordlessly to their mountains—and this autumn not a single villager had
disappeared. There was menace in this immunity. It was not like the very old folk to spare
their victims at the Sabbath. It was too good to be normal, and the villagers were afraid.
For many nights there had been a hollow drumming on the hills, and at last the ædile Tib.
Annæus Stilpo (half native in blood) had sent to Balbutius at Calagurris for a cohort to stamp
out the Sabbath on the terrible night. Balbutius had carelessly refused, on the ground that the
villagers' fears were empty, and that the loathsome rites of hill folk were of no concern to the
Roman People unless our own citizens were menaced. I, however, who seemed to be a close
friend of Balbutius, had disagreed with him; averring that I had studied deeply in the black
forbidden lore, and that I believed the very old folk capable of visiting almost any nameless
doom upon the town, which after all was a Roman settlement and contained a great number
of our citizens. The complaining ædile's own mother Helvia was a pure Roman, the daughter
of M. Helvius Cinna, who had come over with Scipio's army. Accordingly I had sent a slave—a
nimble little Greek called Antipater—to the proconsul with letters, and Scribonius had heeded
my plea and ordered Balbutius to send his fifth cohort, under Asellius, to Pompelo; entering
the hills at dusk on the eve of November's Kalends and stamping out whatever nameless
orgies he might find—bringing such prisoners as he might take to Tarraco for the next
proprætor's court. Balbutius, however, had protested, so that more correspondence had
ensued. I had written so much to the proconsul that he had become gravely interested, and
had resolved to make a personal inquiry into the horror.
He had at length proceeded to Pompelo with his lictors and attendants; there hearing enough
rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed, and standing firmly by his order for the
Sabbath's extirpation. Desirous of conferring with one who had studied the subject, he
ordered me to accompany Asellius' cohort—and Balbutius had also come along to press his
adverse advice, for he honestly believed that drastic military action would stir up a dangerous
sentiment of unrest amongst the Vascones both tribal and settled.
So here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills—old Scribonius Libo in his toga
prætexta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, Balbutius
with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue-shaven lips compressed in conscientiously
dogged opposition, young Asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the
curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants. I
myself seemed to wear a common toga, and to have no especially distinguishing
characteristic. And everywhere horror brooded. The town and country folk scarcely dared
speak aloud, and the men of Libo's entourage, who had been there nearly a week, seemed to
have caught something of the nameless dread. Old Scribonius himself looked very grave, and
the sharp voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness,
as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic god.
We entered the prætorium and held grave converse. Balbutius pressed his objections, and
was sustained by Asellius, who appeared to hold all the natives in extreme contempt while at
the same time deeming it inadvisable to excite them. Both soldiers maintained that we could
better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction, than to
antagonise a probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites.
I, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on
any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous Vascones were at best
turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later
whichever course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries
to our legions, and that it would ill become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer
barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic
demanded. That, on the other hand, the successful administration of a province depended
primarily upon the safety and good-will of the civilised element in whose hands the local
machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed, and in whose veins a large mixture of our
own Italian blood coursed. These, though in numbers they might form a minority, were the
stable element whose constancy might be relied on, and whose cooperation would most firmly
bind the province to the Imperium of the Senate and the Roman People. It was at once a duty
and an advantage to afford them the protection due to Roman citizens; even (and here I shot
a sarcastic look at Balbutius and Asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and activity, and of
a slight interruption of the draught-playing and cock-fighting at the camp in Calagurris. That
the danger to the town and inhabitants of Pompelo was a real one, I could not from my
studies doubt. I had read many scrolls out of Syria and Ægyptus, and the cryptic towns of
Etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in
the woods bordering Lacus Nemorensis. There were shocking dooms that might be called out
of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the
Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but
little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul,
had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia—a matter kept
ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set
open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything
with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too
much for the powers of a single cohort. Only participants need be apprehended, and the
sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment
which any of the sympathising country folk might feel. In short, both principle and policy
demanded stern action; and I could not doubt but that Publius Scribonius, bearing in mind the
dignity and obligations of the Roman People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the
cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius—speaking
indeed more like provincials than Romans—might see fit to offer and multiply.
The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal
and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words, and
stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius and
Asellius assenting, the former with better grace than the latter. As twilight fell on the wild
autumnal slopes, a measured, hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in
terrible rhythm. Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands brought
them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus.
Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty
was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally a young
man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the
foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon
trembling over the woods on our left. That which disquieted us most was the fact that the
Sabbath was to be held at all. Reports of the coming cohort must have reached the hills, and
even the lack of a final decision could not make the rumour less alarming—yet there were the
sinister drums as of yore, as if the celebrants had some peculiar reason to be indifferent
whether or not the forces of the Roman People marched against them. The sound grew
louder as we entered a rising gap in the hills, steep 

sido inimaginavelmente cara de se construir.
Era, disse Gentry, uma das coisas mais estranhas que
alguém poderia construir, embora houvesse rumores de
que tais coisas existiam e que tinham seus propósitos,
mais especificamente para o armazenamento de vastas
quantidades de dados confidenciais. Sem link algum com
a matrix global,
os dados estavam imunes a qualquer ataque via
ciberespaço. A questão era, naturalmente, que não
poderia ser acessado através da matrix; era um arquivo
morto.
– Ele pode ter qualquer coisa lá dentro – disse Gentry,
parando para olhar o rosto inconsciente.
Girou no calcanhar e começou a caminhar de novo. Um
mundo. Mundos. Um número monstruoso deconstructos de personalidade...
– Como se estivesse vivendo em um stim? – perguntou
Cherry. – É por isso que ele está sempre
em REM?
– Não – disse Gentry –, não é simstim. É completamente
interativo. E é uma questão de escala.
Se este é um biosoft da classe aleph, ele pode ter
literalmente qualquer coisa ali. De certa forma, ele pode
ter uma aproximação de tudo...
– Fiquei com a impressão, ouvindo o Kid Afrika – disse
Cherry –, de que este cara está pagando
para ficar assim. Como faria um wirehead, só que
diferente. E mesmo assim, os wireheads não ficam em
REM deste jeito...
– Mas quando você tentou trazê-lo para fora usando as
suas coisas – arriscou Slick – o que veio
foi aquela... coisa. – Percebeu os ombros de Gentry se
retesarem por baixo da jaqueta de couro.
– Sim – disse Gentry –, e agora tenho que reconstruir
nossa conta junto à Autoridade de Fissão.
– Apontou para as baterias de armazenamento
permanente, empilhadas debaixo da mesa de inox. –
Pegue-as para mim.
– Isso aí – disse Cherry. – Já estava na hora. Estou
congelando até a alma.***
Deixaram Gentry debruçado sobre um console de
ciberespaço e voltaram para o quarto de Slick. Cherry
tinha insistido em que ligassem o cobertor elétrico de
Gentry em uma das baterias, de modo que ela pudesse
cobrir a maca. Tinha sobrado café frio no fogão de
butano; Slick bebeu assim mesmo, sem se preocupar em
esquentá-lo, enquanto Cherry olhava fixamente pela
janela, para a planície coberta de neve de Solitude.
– Como ficou desse jeito? – perguntou ela.
– Gentry diz que a ideia era fazer um aterro sanitário,
cem anos atrás. Depois colocaram um monte de terra
boa por cima, mas nada crescia aqui. A maior parte do
lixo era tóxica. A chuva levou a cobertura embora. Acho
que alguma hora desistiram e começaram a jogar mais
porcarias por cima.
Não se pode beber água lá; está cheia de PCB e outras
coisas.
– E quanto àqueles coelhos que o Bird vai caçar?
– Ficam a oeste daqui. Não vêm para Solitude. Nem
mesmo ratos. De qualquer maneira, temos
que testar toda carne que se consegue por aqui.
– Há pássaros, contudo.
– Só fazem os ninhos aqui, mas vão para outro lugar
procurar comida.
– O que há entre você e Gentry? – Ela ainda estava
olhando para fora, pela janela.– O que você quer dizer?
– Minha primeira impressão era de que vocês eram gays.
Um casal, quero dizer.
– Não.
– Mas é como se vocês precisassem um do outro de
alguma maneira.
– Esse lugar é dele, a Fábrica. O cara me deixa morar
aqui. Eu... preciso morar aqui. Para fazer
meu trabalho.
– Para construir aquelas coisas lá embaixo?
A lâmpada dentro do cone amarelado de fax acendeu; o
ventilador do aquecedor começou a funcionar.
– Bem – disse Cherry, agachando-se em frente ao
aquecedor e tirando uma jaqueta após a outra
–, ele pode ser louco, mas acabou de fazer uma coisa
certa.
***
Gentry estava reclinado na velha cadeira de escritório
quando Slick entrou no loft, encarando um pequeno
monitor móvel em seu console.
– Robert Newmark – disse Gentry.
– Hã?
– Identificação retinal. Ou este é Robert Newmark ou
alguém que comprou os olhos dele.– Como você conseguiu isso? – Slick abaixou-se para
espiar a tela com as estatísticas de nascimento.
Gentry ignorou a pergunta. – Só tem isto. Se forçar a
barra, você vai encontrar algo inteiramente diferente.
– Como assim?
– Alguém quer saber se qualquer um fizer perguntas
sobre o Sr. Newmark.
– Quem?
– Eu não sei. – Gentry tamborilou os dedos em suas
calças de couro. – Olhe para isto: nada.
Nascido em Barrytown. Mãe: Marsha Newmark. Nós
temos o SIN dele, mas definitivamente foi marcado. –
Empurrou a cadeira de volta em seus rodízios e virou-se
para poder ver o rosto imobilizado do Conde. – Que tal
isso, Newmark? É este o seu nome? – Levantou-se e se
dirigiu à mesa holográfica.
– Não – disse Slick.
Gentry tocou no botão de força na mesa holográfica.
E a coisa cinzenta estava lá de novo, por um instante,
mas desta vez mergulhou em direção ao
centro do display hemisférico, definhou, e sumiu. Não.
Estava lá, uma esfera cinza minúscula bem no centro do
campo de projeção brilhante.
O sorriso louco de Gentry havia retornado. – Bom – ele
disse.
– O que é bom?– Saquei o que é isso. É um tipo de ICE. Um programa de
segurança.
– Aquele macaco?
– Alguém tem senso de humor. Se o macaco não lhe
amedronta, transforma-se numa ervilha... –
Ele cruzou em direção à mesa e começou a fuçar num
dos painéis. – Mas duvido que eles sejam capazes de
fazer aquilo com um link sensorial direto. – Segurava
alguma coisa em suas mãos. Uma
rede de trodos.
– Gentry, não faz isso! Olha pra ele!
– Eu não vou fazer isso – disse Gentry. – Você vai.

FANTASMAS E VAZIOS
Olhando fixamente através dos vidros sujos do táxi,
notou que sentia falta de Colin e seus comentários
irônicos, depois lembrou-se de que aquilo ali estava
totalmente além da esfera de conhecimentos dele. A
Maas-Neotek teria fabricado uma unidade semelhante
para o Sprawl, perguntou-se, e, se o fez, que forma teria
o fantasma?
– Sally – disse ela, talvez meia hora após partirem para
Nova York –, por que Petal deixou que
você me levasse?
– Porque foi esperto.– E o meu pai?
– Seu pai vai estrebuchar.
– Como?
– Vai ficar furioso. Se descobrir. Quem sabe não
descubra. Não ficaremos aqui por muito tempo.
– Por que estamos aqui?
– Preciso falar com alguém.
– Mas por que estou aqui?
– Você não gosta daqui?
Kumiko hesitou. – Sim, gosto.
– Bom. – Sally se moveu no assento quebrado. – Petal
teve que nos deixar partir. Porque não poderia nos
impedir sem machucar uma de nós. Bem, talvez não
machucar. Seria mais como insultar.
Swain poderia lhe atacar, dizer mais tarde que sentia
muito, dizer para seu pai que era para o seu próprio bem,
se necessário, mas se ele me atacasse teria se exposto,
certo? Quando vi Petal lá embaixo com a arma, soube
que nos deixaria partir. Seu quarto está grampeado. O
lugar inteiro está.
Eu disparei os sensores de movimento quando estava
arrumando suas roupas. Já tinha pensado nisso.
Petal sabia que era eu. Foi por isso que ligou pelo
telefone, para que eu soubesse que ele sabia.
– Não entendo.– Uma espécie de cortesia, para que eu soubesse que ele
estava esperando. Me deu uma chance
para pensar. Mas ele não tinha escolha e sabia disso.
Entenda, Swain está sendo forçado a fazer algo e Petal
sabe disso. Ou, pelo menos, Swain diz que está sendo
forçado. Eu, definitivamente, estou sendo forçada. Então
comecei a pensar o quanto Swain precisava de mim.
Precisa muito. Porque me deixaram fugir com a filha do
oyabun, enviada até Notting Hill por medida de
segurança. Alguma coisa por lá o assusta bem mais do
que seu pai. A menos que seja alguma coisa que o
deixará mais
rico do que seu pai já o tornou. De qualquer maneira,
levar você meio que equilibra as coisas. É dar um troco.
Você se importa?
– Mas você está sendo ameaçada?
– Alguém sabe demais sobre coisas que eu fiz.
– E Tick descobriu a identidade dessa pessoa?
– Sim. Mas acho que eu já sabia. Queria muito estar
completamente enganada.

O hotel que Sally escolheu tinha uma fachada de painéis
de aço manchados pela ferrugem, cada
painel preso com rebites cromados brilhantes, um estilo
que Kumiko conhecia de Tóquio e pensava
estar um pouco fora de moda.O quarto delas era amplo e cinza, uma dúzia de tons de
cinza, e Sally caminhou direto para a cama, depois de ter
trancado a porta; tirou a jaqueta e se deitou.
– Você não tem uma mala – disse Kumiko.
Sally se sentou e começou a tirar as botas. – Eu posso
comprar o que preciso. Você está cansada?
– Não.
– Eu estou. – Tirou o suéter preto. Seus seios eram
pequenos, com mamilos rosados escuros; uma cicatriz,
correndo bem abaixo do mamilo esquerdo, desaparecia
dentro da linha da cintura do jeans.
– Você se machucou – disse Kumiko, olhando a cicatriz.
Sally olhou para baixo. – Sim.
– Por que não mandou tirar?
– Às vezes é bom lembrar.
– Que se machucou?
– Que fui estúpida.
***
Cinza sobre cinza. Incapaz de dormir, Kumiko caminhava
de um lado para o outro pelo carpete
cinza. Havia alguma coisa vampiresca naquele quarto,
concluiu, algo que teria em comum com milhões de
outros quartos, como se seu desconcertante anonimato
perfeito
estivesse
sugando
sua
personalidade,
fragmentos da qual emergiam como vozes de seus pais,exaltadas numa discussão, como os
secretários em ternos pretos de seu pai...
rostos
dos
Sally dormia, seu rosto uma máscara tranquila. A visão
da janela não dizia absolutamente nada
para Kumiko: apenas que estava presa numa cidade que
não era nem Tóquio, nem Londres, uma vasta
confusão genérica que era o paradigma da realidade
urbana de seu século.
Talvez ela tivesse dormido também, embora mais tarde
não tivesse certeza. Observou Sally pedir produtos de
higiene e roupa de baixo, digitando os pedidos no vídeo
ao lado da cama. Suas compras foram entregues
enquanto Kumiko estava no banho.
– Ok – disse Sally, do outro lado da porta –, se enxuga e
se veste, nós vamos ver o cara.
– Que cara? – perguntou Kumiko, mas Sally não a ouviu.
***
Gomi.
Trinta e cinco por cento da área de Tóquio foi construída
sobre gomi, em extensões de terra subtraídas à Baía ao
longo de um século de aterros sistemáticos. Gomi, lá, era
um recurso a ser administrado, a ser coletado, separado,
cuidadosamente enterrado.
A relação de Londres com o gomi era mais sutil, mais
tortuosa. Aos olhos de Kumiko, a maior parte da cidade
era composta por gomi, estruturas que a economia
japonesa há muito teria devorado em sua fomeinsaciável por espaço para construção. Ainda assim,
essas estruturas revelavam, mesmo para Kumiko, a
tessitura do tempo, cada parede remendada por
gerações de mãos numa tarefa contínua de restauração.
Os ingleses valorizavam seu gomi naquilo que tinha de
próprio, de um modo que ela aos poucos começara a
compreender: moravam nele.
Gomi, no Sprawl, era completamente diferente: um
húmus rico, uma putrefação que fazia brotar prodígios de
aço e polímero. A aparente falta de planejamento, por si
só, era o suficiente para deixá-
la confusa, sendo tão contrária aos valores que sua
própria cultura atribuía ao uso eficiente da terra.
A corrida de táxi do aeroporto já tinha mostrado a ela a
decadência, quarteirões inteiros em ruínas, janelas sem
vidro escancaradas acima de calçadas cobertas de lixo. E
rostos observando enquanto o hovercraft blindado abria
caminho pelas ruas.
Agora Sally a tinha jogado abruptamente na total
estranheza daquele lugar, com sua podridão e
sua aleatoriedade enraizando torres mais altas do que
qualquer outra em Tóquio, obeliscos corporativos que
furavam a trama cheia de fuligem dos domos
sobrepostos.
Duas corridas de táxi após o hotel, desceram e se
misturaram às ruas, às turbas do entardecer e
uma sombra oblíqua. O ar estava frio, mas não era
aquele frio de Londres, e Kumiko pensou nas florações
em Ueno Park.A primeira parada foi num grande bar meio decadente
chamado Gentleman Loser, onde Sally teve uma
conversa silenciosa e rápida com o bartender.
Saíram sem tomar um drinque.
***
– Fantasmas – disse Sally, virando uma esquina com
Kumiko ao seu lado. As ruas tinham ficado
progressivamente mais vazias nos últimos quarteirões,
os prédios mais escuros e mais decrépitos.
– Como?
– Há muitos fantasmas aqui para mim, ou pelos menos
deveria haver.
– Você conhece este lugar?
– Claro. Parece o mesmo de sempre, só que diferente,
sabe?
– Não...
– Um dia você vai saber. Quando encontrarmos quem
estou procurando, continue em seu papel
de boa menina: fale se falarem contigo, do contrário
fique quieta.
– Quem estamos procurando?
– O cara. Ou, pelo menos, o que sobrou dele...
Meio quarteirão adiante, na rua horrível que parecia
vazia – Kumiko nunca havia visto uma ruavazia antes, a não ser pela alameda de Swain, recoberta
com a neve de meia-noite –, Sally parou ao lado de uma
loja antiga e nada convidativa, suas vitrines duplas
cobertas por dentro com uma pesada camada de poeira.
Espiando através delas, Kumiko leu as letras de vidro
num sinal de neon apagado: METRO, depois uma palavra
mais longa. A porta entre as vitrines tinha sido reforçada
com uma folha de aço conrugado; havia cavilhas
enferrujadas saindo da folha, a intervalos regulares,
pelas quais corria arame farpado galvanizado.
Sally estava de frente para aquela porta; endireitou os
ombros e executou uma série fluida de gestos rápidos e
curtos.
Kumiko observou enquanto a sequência era repetida. –
Sally...
– Jive, linguagem de sinais – Sally cortou-a. – Eu lhe disse
para ficar quieta, ok?
– Sim? – A voz, pouco mais que um sussurro, parecia não
vir de nenhum lugar específico.
– Já lhe disse – falou Sally.
– Não falo jive.
– Quero falar com ele – disse, com uma voz dura e
cautelosa.
– Ele está morto.
– Sei disso.Um silêncio se seguiu e Kumiko ouviu um som que
poderia ter sido o vento, o vento frio e cortante
percorrendo a curva das geodésicas longe acima delas.
– Ele não está aqui – disse a voz, e pareceu retroceder. –
Ao redor da esquina, meio quarteirão,
entrando à esquerda no beco.
***
Kumiko nunca se esqueceria daquele beco: tijolos
escuros, escorregadios com a umidade, torres
de ventilação deixando trilhas negras de poeira
congelada, uma lâmpada amarela dentro de uma grade
de metal corroído, garrafas vazias em crescimento lento
brotando da base de cada parede, ninhos da altura de
pessoas formados por fax amassado e espuma branca de
embalagem e o som das
botas de Sally.
Para além do brilho fraco das lâmpadas havia escuridão,
embora um lampejo refletido no tijolo
úmido mostrasse uma última parede, rua sem saída, e
Kumiko
hesitou,
assustada
por
um
súbito
estremecimento de eco, algo escorrendo, água pingando
continuamente...
Sally ergueu a mão. Um facho concentrado de luz muito
forte emoldurou um círculo nítido traçado com tinta nos
tijolos, depois desceu lentamente.
Desceu até encontrar a coisa na base do muro, metal
opaco, uma estrutura vertical arredondadaque Kumiko pensou ser outro ventilador. Perto de sua
base havia tocos de velas brancas, um frasco de plástico
cheio de líquido claro, um sortimento de pacotes de
cigarro, cigarros soltos espalhados e uma figura
detalhada, com múltiplos braços, desenhada no que
parecia ser giz branco.
Sally deu um passo à frente, sem mover o feixe, e
Kumiko viu que a coisa blindada estava presa
no muro de tijolos com enormes rebites.
– Finlandês?
Um rápido piscar de luz rosa vindo de uma fenda
horizontal.
– Ei, Fin, cara... – Uma hesitação incomum na voz dela...
– Moll. – Uma qualidade áspera, como se viesse de um
alto-falante quebrado. – Qual é a da lanterna? Você ainda
tem os implantes? Está envelhecendo, não consegue ver
legal no escuro?
– É para a minha amiga.
Alguma coisa se moveu atrás da fenda, sua cor um rosa
doentio de cinza quente de cigarro no
sol de meio-dia; o rosto de Kumiko foi coberto por uma
luz pulsante.
– Sei – arranhou a voz. – E quem é ela?
– A filha de Yanaka.
– Cacete.Sally baixou a luz, que recaiu sobre as velas, o frasco, os
cigarros cinzentos úmidos, o símbolo
branco com seus braços emplumados.
– Sirva-se das oferendas – disse a voz. – Há meio litro de
Moskovskaya aí. O desenho vodu é de farinha. Maior
azar; os mais devotos costumam usar cocaína.
– Jesus – disse Sally, um estranho distanciamento em sua
voz, agachando-se. – Que maluquice é
essa? – Kumiko observou enquanto ela pegava o frasco
para cheirar o seu conteúdo.
– Beba. É coisa boa. Porra, melhor ser mesmo. Ninguém
sacaneia o oráculo, não se souberem o
que é bom para eles.
– Fin – disse Sally, depois virou o frasco e bebeu,
limpando a boca com as costas da mão –, você deve ter
pirado...
– Seria pedir demais. Plugado num troço desses já é
difícil ter um pouco de imaginação, quando
mais pirar.
Kumiko se aproximou, depois se ajoelhou ao lado de
Sally.
– É um constructo de personalidade? – Sally largou o
frasco de vodca e mexeu na farinha úmida
com a ponta de uma unha branca.– Claro. Você já os viu antes. Memória em tempo real, se
eu quiser, conectada no ciber-e, se eu
quiser. Consegui esse esquema de oráculo para manter
um pé dentro, sacou? – A coisa fez um som
estranho: risada. – Problemas no amor? Uma mulher
malvada que não te entende? – O barulho de risada de
novo, como picos de estática. – Na verdade, curto mais
dar conselhos sobre negócios. São os garotos da área
que deixam as oferendas. Dá um toque místico, algo
assim. De vez em quando pinta um descrente, um
babaca qualquer que se serve sem pedir licença. – Um fio
muito fino de luz escarlate piscou na abertura e uma
garrafa estourou em algum lugar à direita de Kumiko.
Risada estática. – Então, o que traz você aqui, Moll? Você
e – novamente a luz rosa pulsou pelo rosto de Kumiko – a
filha de Yanaka...
– A missão Straylight – disse Sally.
– Faz muito tempo, Moll...
– Ela está atrás de mim, Fin. Quatorze anos e aquela puta
louca está na minha cola...
– Talvez ela não tenha nada melhor para fazer. Sabe
como são esses ricaços...
– Você sabe onde Case está, Fin? Talvez ela esteja atrás
dele...
– Case caiu fora. Deu umas boas tacadas depois que
vocês se separaram, depois chutou o balde e
saiu fora, limpo. Se você tivesse feito a mesma coisa,
talvez não estivesse congelando os ossos num beco,certo? Pela última que eu soube, ele tem quatro filhos...
***
Observando a varredura hipnótica do scanner rosa,
Kumiko tinha uma ideia do que era a coisa
com a qual Sally falava. Havia coisas semelhantes no
estúdio de seu pai, quatro delas, cubos laqueados de
preto arrumados ao longo de uma prateleira baixa de
pinho. Sobre cada cubo havia um
retrato formal pendurado. Os retratos eram fotografias
monocromáticas de homens em ternos escuros e
gravatas, quatro cavalheiros muito sóbrios, cujas lapelas
estavam decoradas com pequenos emblemas de metal,
do tipo que seu pai algumas vezes usava. Embora sua
mãe houvesse dito que os
cubos continham os fantasmas dos ancestrais malignos
de seu pai, Kumiko os achava mais fascinantes do que
assustadores. Se realmente continham fantasmas,
pensou, seriam bem pequenos, já que os cubos mal
podiam conter a cabeça de uma criança.
Seu pai às vezes meditava em frente aos cubos,
ajoelhando-se em seu tatame, numa atitude que
revelava profundo respeito. Ela o tinha visto naquela
posição muitas vezes, mas foi apenas aos dez anos que
ouviu-o falar com os cubos pela primeira vez. E um deles
tinha respondido. A pergunta não significava nada para
ela, a resposta muito menos, mas o tom calmo do
fantasma, ao responder, tinha a deixado gelada lá no
canto onde estava escondida, atrás de uma porta de
papel, e seu pai riu ao descobrir que estava lá; em vez de
repreendê-la, explicou que os cubos abrigavam aspersonalidades gravadas de antigos executivos, diretores
corporativos. As almas deles? ela tinha perguntado. Não,
respondeu ele, sorrindo, então acrescentou que a
distinção era sutil. – Eles não estão conscientes.
Respondem, quando questionados, de certa forma
aproximando-se da resposta daquela pessoa. Se são
fantasmas, então os hologramas também são.
Depois da explicação de Sally sobre a história e a
hierarquia da Yakuza, no bar de robata em Earls Court,
Kumiko havia concluído que cada um dos homens nas
fotografias, os sujeitos das gravações de personalidade,
tinha sido um oyabun.
A coisa na carcaça blindada, raciocinou, era de natureza
similar, embora talvez mais complexa,
assim como Colin era uma versão mais complexa do guia
Michelin que os secretários de seu pai levavam durante
suas excursões de compras em Shinjuku. Finlandês, foi o
nome que Sally usou, e era evidente que este Finlandês
havia sido um amigo ou parceiro dela.
Mas será que ele ficava acordado, perguntou-se Kumiko,
quando o beco estava vazio? Será que
sua visão a laser escaneava a queda silenciosa da neve à
meia-noite?
***
– Europa – Sally começou –, quando me separei de Case
fui para lá e andei por todos os lugares.Tinha muito dinheiro, o que recebemos pelo trabalho, ou
pelo menos parecia ser muito na época. A
IA da Tessier-Ashpool pagou tudo através de um banco
suíço. Apagou qualquer traço de que havíamos estado lá
em cima; estou dizendo tudo mesmo – por exemplo, se
você tentasse procurar os nomes que usamos para viajar
no transporte da JAL, simplesmente não existiam. Case
verificou tudo quando voltamos a Tóquio, entrou em
várias bases de dados; era como se nada jamais tivesse
acontecido. Eu não entendi como se podia fazer aquilo,
mesmo sendo uma IA, mas ninguém nunca
compreendeu de fato o que aconteceu lá em cima,
quando Case pilotou aquele quebra-gelo, o ICE-
Breaker chinês até o núcleo do seu ICE.
– A IA tentou entrar em contato, depois?
– Não que eu saiba. Ele tinha esta ideia de que a IA tinha
sumido, de certa forma; não sumido mesmo, mas sumido
dentro de tudo, da matrix inteira. Como se não estivesse
mais no ciberespaço, mas apenas estivesse. E se não
quisesse que você a visse, que não soubesse que estava
lá, bem, você não teria como, e nem pensar em provar
para qualquer um, mesmo que você soubesse... E eu
definitivamente não queria saber. Quero dizer, seja lá o
que fosse, parecia terminado para mim, acabado.
Armitage estava morto, Riviera estava morto, Ashpool
estava morto, o piloto rastafári do rebocador que nos
levou até lá estava de volta no aglomerado de Zion e o
cara provavelmente achou que tudo aquilo foi só outra
viagem de ganja. .. Deixei Case no Tóquio Hyatt, nunca
mais o vi...
– Por quê?– Sei lá. Sem motivos. Eu era jovem, apenas parecia que
tinha acabado.
– Mas você a deixou lá em cima, no poço, em Straylight.
– Deixei. Penso nisso de vez em quando. Quando nós
estávamos partindo, Fin, era como se ela
não se importasse com nada daquilo. Como se eu tivesse
matado o pai dela, louco de pedra, no lugar dela, e Case
tinha arrombado seus núcleos e deixado suas IAS soltas
na matrix... Então eu a coloquei na lista, certo? Um dia
você se mete numa enrascada das grossas, alguém está
na cola, daí é bom olhar a lista.
– E você pensou nela, na hora?
– Não. Minha lista é bem longa.
Case, que para Kumiko parecia ter sido algo mais do que
um simples sócio de Sally, nunca reapareceu na história.
Enquanto Kumiko ouvia Sally condensar quatorze anos
de sua história pessoal para atualizar Fin, ficou
imaginando a versão mais jovem dessa Sally como uma
heroína bishonen de um vídeo romântico tradicional:
misteriosa, elegante e mortífera. Apesar de achar o
relato prosaico de Sally sobre sua vida difícil de
acompanhar, com referências a lugares e coisas que ela
não conhecia, era fácil imaginá-la vencendo as batalhas
de forma súbita e fulgurante como se esperava das
bishonen.
Mas não, pensou, ao ouvir Sally falar de “um ano ruim
em Hamburgo”, uma fúria repentina em suavoz – uma fúria antiga, algo decorrido uma década antes
–, era um erro tentar encaixar esta mulher nos padrões
japoneses. Não havia nenhum ronin, nenhum samurai
errante; Sally e Fin estavam discutindo negócios.
Ela havia chegado ao ano ruim em Hamburgo, segundo o
que Kumiko compreendeu, depois de
ter ganhado e perdido algum tipo de fortuna. Tinha
ganhado a sua parte desse dinheiro “lá em cima”, em um
lugar que Fin chamara de Straylight, em sociedade com o
tal de Case. Ao fazer isso, havia ganhado um inimigo.
– Hamburgo – interrompeu o Fin. – Ouvi histórias sobre
Hamburgo...
– O dinheiro tinha sumido. Sabe como é, quando a
transação é grande e você é jovem... Ficar sem dinheiro,
de certa forma, era voltar ao normal, mas eu estava
envolvida com este pessoal de Frankfurt, em dívida com
eles, e queriam zerar as coisas fazendo uma troca.
– Que tipo de troca?
– Queriam que algumas pessoas fossem assassinadas.
– E aí?
– Aí eu caí fora. Quando pude. Fui para Londres...
Talvez, Kumiko concluiu, Sally um dia já tenha sido ronin,
uma espécie de samurai. Em Londres, contudo, ela havia
se tornado outra coisa, uma mulher de negócios. Tendo
se mantido de uma forma não muito explicada, ela
gradualmente se tornou uma investidora, fornecendo
fundos para vários tipos de operações de negócios. (O
que era um “crédito a fundo perdido”? O que era“lavagem de informação”?)
– Sim – disse o Fin –, você se saiu bem. Conseguiu ações
de um cassino alemão.
– Aix-la-Chapelle. Eu estava na diretoria. Ainda estou,
quando conseguir o passaporte certo.
– Vai se acomodar? – A risada de novo.
– Com certeza.
– Não foi bem o que ouvi, por aqui.
– Eu estava administrando um cassino. Era isso. Estava
bem.
– Você estava lutando por dinheiro. “Misty Steele”, peso
leve aumentada. Foram oito lutas e apostei em cinco
delas. Lutas sangrentas, querida. Ilegal.
– Hobby.
– E que hobby! Assisti aos vídeos. Burmese Kid abriu
você até em cima, ao vivo e a cores...
Kumiko lembrou-se da longa cicatriz.
– Daí eu desisti. Foi há cinco anos e, na época, eu já tinha
cinco anos mais do que deveria.
– Você era boa, mas “Misty Steele”... Cacete.
– Dá um tempo. Não inventei esse nome.
– Claro. Então me fala sobre nossa amiga lá em cima,
como ela entrou em contato.– Swain. Roger Swain. Enviou um de seus capangas ao
cassino, um aspirante a durão chamado
Prior. Cerca de um mês atrás.
– Swain, o intermediário? De Londres?
– O próprio. E Prior tinha um presente para mim, cerca de
um metro de impressão. Uma lista.
Nomes, datas, lugares.
– Era feia?
– Tinha tudo lá. Coisas de que mesmo eu já tinha
esquecido.
– O trabalho em Straylight?
– Tudo. Então preparei uma mala, voltei para Londres e lá
estava Swain. Ele sentia muito, não
era culpa dele, mas tinha que me chantagear. Porque
alguém estava chantageando ele. Tinha a sua própria
lista de um metro para se preocupar. – Kumiko ouviu os
saltos de Sally girarem no asfalto.
– O que ele quer?
– Um sequestro, um corpo quente. Celebridade.
– Por que você?
– Putz, Fin, foi justamente por isso que vim aqui, pra te
perguntar.
– Swain te disse que era 3Jane?– Não. Mas meu cowboy de console em Londres disse.
Os joelhos de Kumiko doíam.
– A garota. Como você se meteu com ela?
– Ela apareceu na casa de Swain. Yanaka a queria fora de
Tóquio. Swain devia giri para ele.
– Ela está limpa, de qualquer jeito, sem implantes. Pelas
notícias recentes que chegaram de Tóquio, Yanaka está
metido em confusões...
Kumiko tremeu no escuro.
– E quem é o sequestrado, a celebridade? – continuou o
Fin.
Ela sentiu que Sally hesitou. – Angela Mitchell.
O
metrônomo
rosa
balançando
silenciosamente,
esquerda para direita, direita para esquerda.
– Está frio aqui, Fin.
– Sim. Queria poder sentir. Acabei de fazer uma pequena
viagem por você, visitando o passado.
Você sabe exatamente de onde Angie vem?
– Não.
– Estou no ramo de oráculos, querida, não sou uma
biblioteca de pesquisas... O pai dela era Christopher
Mitchell. Ele era o fodão na pesquisa de biochips na Maas
Biolabs. Ela cresceu num complexo industrial isolado, no
Arizona, cria da companhia. Há sete anos, alguma coisa
aconteceu lá.A história que circula é que a Hosaka formou uma equipe
para ajudar Mitchell a dar um grande salto em sua
carreira. O fax dizia que houve uma explosão de um
megaton numa propriedade da Maas, porém ninguém
jamais encontrou qualquer radiação. Nunca encontraram
os mercenários da Hosaka
também. A Maas anunciou que Mitchell estava morto,
suicídio.
– Isso é o que todos sabem. O que o oráculo sabe?
– Rumores. Nada muito coerente. Dizem
apareceu aqui, um dia ou dois após a explosão
que
ela
no Arizona, se meteu com alguns caras realmente
estranhos que trabalhavam nos arredores de Nova
Jersey.
– Trabalhavam em quê?
– Tráfico. Software, basicamente. Comprando, vendendo.
Algumas vezes compravam de mim...
– Quão estranhos eram os caras?
– Vodu. Pensavam que a matrix estava repleta de
mambos e outras merdas. Quer saber de uma
coisa, Moll?
– O quê?
– Eles estão certos.
23ESPELHO, ESPELHO MEU
Ela despertou como se alguém tivesse acionado um
interruptor.
Não abriu os olhos. Ela podia ouvi-los falar numa outra
sala. Doía em muitos lugares, mas nada
muito pior do que o wiz. A ressaca já tinha passado, ou
talvez reduzida pelo que tivessem lhe dado naquele
spray.
Um avental de papel áspero sobre seus mamilos;
pareciam grandes e macios, e os seios lhe pareciam
cheios. Pequenos fios de dor beliscando seu rosto, dores
gêmeas nas órbitas dos olhos, sensação de irritação na
boca e o gosto de sangue.
– Eu não estou querendo lhe dar lições sobre como
conduzir suas coisas – dizia Gerald, a voz
sobre água corrente e ruídos metálicos, como se
estivesse lavando panelas ou algo assim –, mas você
está se fazendo de tolo se pensa que ela vai enganar
alguém que não queira ser enganado. É realmente um
trabalho muito superficial.
Prior disse alguma coisa que ela não conseguiu distinguir.
– Eu disse superficial, não vulgar. É um trabalho de
qualidade, do início ao fim. Vinte e quatro
horas em um estimulador dérmico e você não saberá que
ela esteve aqui. Mantenha a garota sob antibióticos e
longe das drogas; o sistema imunológico dela não é
grande coisa.Então Prior falou novamente,
conseguia entender.
mas
ela
ainda
não
Abriu os olhos, mas havia apenas o teto, quadrados
brancos de revestimento acústico. Virou sua
cabeça para a esquerda. A parede de plástico branco
com uma daquelas janelas falsas, animação em
alta resolução de uma praia com palmeiras e ondas;
observando a água por tempo suficiente, você veria as
mesmas ondas se quebrando, em loop, para sempre.
Exceto que a coisa estava quebrada e desgastada, havia
um tipo de hesitação nas ondas, e o vermelho do pôr do
sol piscava como um tubo fluorescente estragado.
Tentar o lado direito. Virou-se novamente, sentindo a
cobertura de papel suada sobre a espuma dura do
travesseiro contra seu pescoço.
E o rosto com olhos machucados olhando para ela da
cama, o nariz coberto com um plástico
claro e fita micropore, algum tipo de geleia marrom sobre
suas bochechas...
Angie. Era o rosto de Angie, emoldurado pelo pôr do sol
refletido, piscando na janela defeituosa.
***
– Não houve intervenção óssea – disse Gerald,
afrouxando cuidadosamente a fita que segurava o
pequeno plástico protetor sobre o nariz dela. – É a beleza
disso tudo. Aplainamos um pouco a cartilagem do nariz,trabalhando através das narinas, depois passamos para
os dentes. Sorria. Linda.
Nós aumentamos seus seios, construímos os mamilos
com tecido erétil cultivado em laboratório, depois
fizemos a coloração dos olhos... – Removeu a proteção. –
Não toque nisto durante as próximas vinte e quatro
horas.
– Foi por isso que fiquei machucada?
– Não. Isto é um trauma secundário do trabalho com a
cartilagem. – Sentia os dedos de Gerald
frios sobre seu rosto, precisos. – Até amanhã, já terá
sumido.
Gerald era legal. Deu-lhe três dermas, dois azuis e um
rosa, macios e confortáveis. Prior definitivamente não era
legal, mas ele tinha saído ou, pelo menos, não estava à
vista. E era simplesmente bom ouvir Gerald explicar
coisas com sua voz calma. E ver aquilo que ele podia
fazer.
– Sardas – disse ela, porque tinham sumido.
– Abrasivos e mais tecido cultivado. Elas voltarão e bem
rápido se você pegar muito sol.
– Ela é tão bonita... – Virou a cabeça.
– Você, Mona. Aquela é você.
Ela olhou o rosto no espelho e tentou imitar o famoso
sorriso.
***Talvez Gerald não fosse legal.
De volta para a cama branca e estreita, onde ele a havia
colocado para descansar, ela ergueu o
braço e olhou para os três dermas. Tranquilizantes.
Flutuando.
Colocou a unha debaixo do derma rosa; tirou-o, grudou-o
na parede branca e apertou forte com
o dedão. Uma única gota de líquido cor de palha
escorreu. Ela o retirou cuidadosamente da parede e o
colocou de volta no braço. A coisa que saiu dos azuis era
leitosa. Colocou-os de volta também.
Talvez ele notasse, mas ela queria saber o que estava
acontecendo.
Olhou no espelho. Gerald disse que poderia voltar do
jeito que era, algum dia, se ela quisesse,
mas então ela se perguntou como ele se lembraria de
sua aparência. Talvez tivesse tirado uma fotografia ou
outra coisa. Agora que tinha pensado nisso, talvez não
houvesse ninguém para lembrar como ela era antes. Ela
pensou que o console de stim de Michael era
provavelmente a melhor aposta, mas ela não sabia seu
endereço ou, mesmo, seu sobrenome. Isso deu a ela uma
sensação engraçada,
como se quem ela tinha sido houvesse ido até a esquina
e nunca mais voltasse. Mas então fechou os olhos e sabia
que era Mona, sempre havia sido, e que nada havia
mudado muito, nada atrás de suas
pálpebras.Lanette dizia que não importava como você se operava.
Lanette disse a ela, uma vez, que não tinha sobrado nem
dez por cento de seu próprio rosto, aquele com o qual
havia nascido. Impossível adivinhar, exceto pelo preto ao
redor das pálpebras, de modo que ela nunca precisava
usar rímel.
Mona pensou que talvez Lanette não tivesse sido muito
bem trabalhada, e isso deve ter cruzado os olhos de
Mona alguma vez, porque Lanette disse: você deveria ter
me visto antes, querida.
Mas agora lá estava ela, Mona, esticada na pequena
cama em Baltimore, e tudo que ela conhecia
de Baltimore era o som de uma sirene em algum lugar da
rua e o barulho do compressor do ar-condicionado de
Gerald.
E, de algum modo, isso se transformou em sono, ela não
soube por quanto tempo, e então Prior
estava lá, com a mão no braço dela, perguntando se
estava com fome.
***
Ela observou Prior fazendo a barba. Ele estava usando
uma pia cirúrgica de inox, aparando a barba com um par
de tesouras cromadas. Então pegou um barbeador
plástico descartável numa caixa
de Gerald. Era estranho assistir a seu rosto revelar-se.
Não era o rosto que esperava: era mais jovem.
Mas a boca era a mesma.– Vamos ficar aqui muito tempo, Prior?
Ele tirou a camisa para barbear-se; tinha tatuagens de
um lado ao outro dos ombros, descendo
pela parte superior dos braços, dragões com cabeças de
leão.
– Não se preocupe com isso – disse ele.
– Está chato.
– Nós vamos conseguir mais stims para você. – Ele
estava rapando debaixo do queixo.
– Como é Baltimore?
– Um saco. Como tudo.
– Então como é a Inglaterra?
– Um saco. – Ele limpou o rosto com papel absorvente
azul.
– Talvez nós pudéssemos sair, comer caranguejos. Gerald
diz que têm caranguejos por aqui.
– Têm sim – respondeu ele. – Vou trazer alguns.
– Que tal me levar para sair?
Ele jogou o papel dentro de uma lata de lixo de metal. –
Não, você pode tentar fugir.
Ela escorregou a mão entre a cama e a parede e
encontrou o pedaço de espuma rasgada onde havia
escondido a arma de choque. Tinha visto suas roupas
numa sacola de plástico branca. Geraldentrava a cada duas horas com novos dermas, que ela
retirava tão logo ele saía. Achava que, se pudesse
convencer Prior a levá-la para comer fora, poderia agir no
restaurante. Mas ele não estava colaborando.
Num restaurante, ela poderia chamar um policial, porque
agora ela havia descoberto qual era o
acordo.
Snuff… Lanette havia lhe contado a respeito. Como havia
homens que pagariam para ter garotas modeladas para
se parecerem com outras pessoas e, depois, as
matavam. Tinham que ser ricos, muito ricos. Não Prior,
mas alguém para quem ele trabalhava. Lanette disse que
esses caras pagavam para modelar as garotas como
suas esposas, às vezes. Mona não tinha acreditado
naquilo, na época: às vezes Lanette lhe contava coisas
apavorantes porque era engraçado ficar com medo
quando você sabia que estava perfeitamente segura e,
de qualquer maneira, Lanette tinha várias histórias sobre
perversões bizarras. Ela disse que os figurões eram os
mais bizarros de todos, os engravatados poderosos nos
altos escalões das grandes empresas, porque não
podiam nunca perder o controle no
trabalho. Mas quando não estavam trabalhando, dizia
Lanette, podiam pagar para perder o controle de
qualquer jeito que quisessem. Então, por que não haveria
um figurão em algum lugar querendo Angie daquela
forma? Bem, havia muitas garotas que já fizeram plástica
para se parecerem com ela, mas eram patéticas.
Imitadoras baratas – e ela nunca havia visto uma que
realmente se parecesse com Angie ou, pelo menos, não o
suficiente para enganar alguém que se importasse com
isso. Contudo,talvez houvesse alguém disposto a pagar por tudo aquilo
apenas pra ter uma garota que realmente se parecesse
com Angie. De qualquer maneira, se não era snuff, o que
era, então?
Agora Prior estava abotoando sua camisa azul. Ele veio
até a cama e tirou os lençóis para conferir os seios dela.
Como se estivesse olhando para um carro ou algo
parecido.
Ela puxou o lençol de volta.
– Vou pegar alguns caranguejos. – Colocou a jaqueta e
saiu. Ela ouviu quando disse alguma coisa para Gerald.
Gerald voltou-se para ela.
– Como você está, Mona?
– Com fome.
– Se sente relaxada?
– Sim...
Quando ficou sozinha novamente, ela se virou e estudou
seu rosto, o rosto de Angie, na parede
espelhada. Os hematomas já tinham praticamente
desaparecido. Gerald havia colado trodos em miniatura
em seu rosto; estavam conectados a uma máquina. Disse
que iriam acelerar a cicatrização.
O rosto de Angie no espelho não a assustava mais. Os
dentes estavam lindos; os dentes ela gostaria de manter.
Quanto ao resto, ainda não estava muito certa.Talvez ela devesse apenas levantar-se agora, colocar as
roupas, caminhar para a porta. Se Gerald tentasse
impedi-la, poderia usar a arma de choque. Então se
lembrou de como Prior a encontrara na casa de Michael,
como se alguém a observasse durante a noite inteira,
seguindo-a.
Talvez alguém estivesse vigiando lá fora. O consultório
de Gerald parecia não ter janela alguma, não as
verdadeiras, portanto teria que sair pela porta.
E estava começando a sentir falta do wiz, mas, mesmo
que tivesse um pouco, Gerald perceberia.
Ela sabia que seu kit estava lá, na bolsa debaixo da
cama. Talvez se ela pegasse um pouco, pensou, apenas
um pouquinho. Mas talvez não fosse uma boa ideia: ela
tinha que admitir que as coisas que fazia sob o efeito do
wiz nem sempre davam certo, mesmo se desse a
impressão de que você jamais
cometeria um erro.
De qualquer maneira, estava com fome, e pena que
Gerald não tivesse alguma música ou algo
assim, então
caranguejos...

ela

NUM LUGAR SOLITÁRIO
E Gentry estava lá, de pé, com a Forma ardendo atrás
dos olhos, segurando a rede de trodos soba luz forte das lâmpadas, dizendo para Slick por que
tinha que ser daquele jeito, por que Slick tinha que
colocar os trodos e se conectar direto naquilo que a
figura imóvel na maca estava recebendo da placa cinza.
Ele sacudiu a cabeça, lembrando-se de como chegara a
Dog Solitude. E Gentry começou a falar
mais rápido, achando que o gesto era uma recusa.
Gentry estava dizendo que Slick tinha que entrar, talvez
por apenas alguns segundos, enquanto
ele determinava a natureza dos dados e criava uma
macroforma. Slick não saberia como fazer aquilo, disse
Gentry, do contrário ele mesmo iria; mas não eram os
dados o que queria, apenas a forma geral, porque ele
achava que isso o levaria à grande Forma, aquela coisa
que tinha perseguido por tanto tempo.
Slick lembrou-se de estar atravessando Solitude a pé.
Estava com medo de que o Korsakov voltasse, de que se
esquecesse de onde estava e bebesse água cancerígena
em uma das poças vermelhas enlameadas na superfície
enferrujada. Espuma vermelha e pássaros mortos
flutuavam com
suas asas abertas. O caminhoneiro do Tennessee havia
lhe dito para caminhar a oeste a partir da rodovia, dentro
de uma hora ele chegaria a uma pista dupla asfaltada e
conseguiria uma carona para Cleveland, mas pareceu
muito mais do que uma hora e ele não estava certo de
que lado ficava o oeste e aquele lugar o assustava,
aquela cicatriz de depósito de lixo, plana como se tivesse
sido pisoteada por um gigante. Uma vez viu alguém ao
longe, sobre uma leve inclinação, e acenou. A figura
desapareceu, mas ele caminhou naquela direção, semdesviar as poças, avançando sobre elas, até que chegou
à elevação e viu que era apenas a carcaça de um avião
sem asas, meio soterrada sob latas enferrujadas.
Avançou por essa inclinação ao longo de um caminho
onde pés haviam amassado as latas, até chegar a uma
abertura quadrada que havia sido uma saída de
emergência. Enfiou a cabeça para dentro e viu centenas
de pequenas cabeças suspensas no teto côncavo.
Congelou, ofuscado pela escuridão repentina, até que o
que estava vendo começou a fazer algum sentido. As
cabeças de plástico rosa de bonecas, seu cabelo de nylon
amarrado em nós e os nós presos num grosso piche
preto, balançando como frutas. Nada mais, apenas
alguns pedaços destroçados de espuma verde suja, e ele
soube que não queria ficar lá para descobrir de quem era
aquele lugar.
Depois foi para o sul, sem saber, e encontrou a Fábrica.
– Eu nunca terei outra chance – disse Gentry. Slick
encarou o rosto tenso, os olhos arregalados
em desespero. – Nunca irei vê-la...
E Slick lembrou-se de quando Gentry bateu nele, como
tinha olhado para baixo, para a chave inglesa e sentiu...
Bem, Cherry não estava certa sobre eles, mas havia algo
mais ali, algo que ele não sabia como chamar. Pegou a
rede de trodos com sua mão esquerda e deu um
empurrão forte no peito
de Gentry com a mão direita. – Cala a boca! Cala essa
boca! – Gentry caiu de costas contra a beirada da mesa
de aço.
Slick o xingou baixinho, enquanto ele arrumava a
delicada rede de dermatrodos de contato ao longo de suatesta e sua têmpora.

Conectou-se.

Suas botas pisaram em cascalho.
Abriu seus olhos e olhou para baixo; o caminho de
cascalho liso na madrugada, mais limpo do
que qualquer coisa em Dog Solitude. Olhou para cima e
viu onde fazia uma curva e, para além disso, havia
árvores verdes e frondosas e o telhado de uma casa que
tinha a metade do tamanho da Fábrica.
Havia estátuas perto dele, na grama úmida e alta. Um
cervo feito de ferro e a figura quebrada do corpo de um
homem esculpido numa pedra branca, sem cabeça,
braços ou pernas. Pássaros estavam
cantando e aquele era o único som.
Começou a andar pelo caminho em direção à casa cinza,
porque não parecia haver outra coisa
para fazer. Quando chegou no fim do caminho, pôde ver
para além da casa – havia construções menores e
também um campo de grama, amplo e plano, onde
planadores estavam amarrados e posicionados contra o
vento.
Um conto de fadas, pensou, olhando para a fachada da
grande mansão de pedra, o vidro das janelas em forma
de diamantes, como um vitral; era como um vídeo a quehavia visto quando era pequeno. Havia mesmo pessoas
que moravam em lugares como aquele? Mas não é um
lugar, lembrou-se, apenas parece ser um.
– Gentry – disse ele –, me tira daqui, ok?
Olhou para as costas de suas mãos. Cicatrizes, sujeira
incrustada, meias-luas de graxa debaixo
de suas unhas quebradas. A graxa penetrava e as
amolecia, então se quebravam facilmente.
Começou a se sentir idiota, parado lá. Talvez alguém o
estivesse observando da casa.
– Foda-se – disse ele, e começou a subir pela calçada
larga de lajotas, inconscientemente mudando sua
passada para o jeito insolente de caminhar que tinha
aprendido no Deacon Blues.
A porta tinha uma coisa presa a um painel central: uma
mão, pequena e graciosa, segurando uma
esfera do tamanho de uma bola de bilhar, toda revestida
em ferro. Estava presa ao pulso de modo que era
possível erguê-la e deixá-la cair. Foi o que fez. Com força.
Duas vezes, e depois mais duas. Nada aconteceu. A
maçaneta da porta era de bronze, com detalhes florais
desgastados até quase sumirem após anos de uso. Girou
facilmente. Abriu a porta.
Piscou diante da riqueza de cores e texturas; superfícies
de madeira escura polida, mármore preto e branco,
tapetes com milhares de cores suaves que brilhavam
como vidraças de uma igreja, prataria polida, espelhos...
Ele sorriu com o choque suave daquilo tudo, seus olhospulando de uma nova visão para outra, tantas coisas,
objetos dos quais nem sabia o nome...
– Procurando por alguém em particular, Jack?
O homem estava parado na frente de uma lareira
enorme, vestindo um jeans escuro apertado e
uma camiseta branca. Seus pés estavam nus e ele
segurava uma taça bojuda de bebida alcoólica na mão
direita. Slick ficou perplexo ao vê-lo.
– Merda – disse Slick – você é ele...
O homem girou a taça até fazer o líquido marrom chegar
à borda e tomou um gole. – Já esperava que Afrika fosse
aprontar algo no gênero, no final das contas – disse ele –,
mas, de algum modo, companheiro, você não parece ser
o tipo de cara que ele contrataria.
– Você é o Conde.
– É – disse ele –, sou o Conde. E quem diabos é você?
– Slick. Slick Henry.
Ele riu. – Quer um pouco de conhaque, Slick Henry? – Ele
gesticulou com o copo em direção a
uma peça de mobília de madeira onde garrafas
ornamentadas estavam dispostas em fila, cada uma com
uma etiqueta prateada, presa por uma corrente.
Slick sacudiu a cabeça.
O homem deu de ombros. – Não dá mesmo para ficar
bêbado... Me perdoe por dizer isso, Slick,mas você está com uma aparência de merda. Estou certo
em supor que você não faz parte da operação de Kid
Afrika? E, se não fizer, o que exatamente está fazendo
aqui?
– Gentry me enviou.
– Quem é Gentry?
– Você é o cara na maca, certo?
– O cara na maca sou eu. Onde, exatamente, neste exato
minuto, está aquela maca, Slick?
– Com Gentry.
– Onde é isso?
– Na Fábrica.
– E onde é isso?
– Dog Solitude.
– E como fui parar nesse lugar, seja lá onde for?
– Kid Afrika, ele trouxe você. Trouxe você com esta garota
chamada Cherry, certo? Sabe, eu devia um favor a ele,
então ele quis que eu ficasse com você por um tempo,
você e Cherry, e ela está tomando conta de você.
– Você me chamou de Conde, Slick...
– Cherry disse que Kid o chamou assim uma vez.
– Me conta, Slick, o Kid parecia preocupado quando me
trouxe?– Cherry diz que ele ficou assustado, lá em Cleveland.
– Tenho certeza que sim. Quem é este Gentry? Um amigo
seu?
– A Fábrica é dele. Eu moro lá também...
– Este Gentry, ele é um cowboy, Slick? Um jóquei de
console? Quero dizer, se você está aqui,
ele deve ser um técnico, certo?
Agora era a vez de Slick sacudir os ombros. – Gentry é,
tipo, é um artista, algo assim. Tem umas teorias. É difícil
de explicar. Ele ligou uma série de splitters naquela coisa
na maca, no que você está plugado. Primeiro tentou
conseguir uma imagem numa mesa holográfica, mas
havia apenas aquela coisa em forma de macaco, tipo
uma sombra, então ele me convenceu a...
– Jesus... Bem, não importa. Esta fábrica de que você
fala, fica fora do perímetro, em algum lugar? É
relativamente isolada?
Slick assentiu.
– E, esta Cherry, é algum tipo de enfermeira contratada?
– Sim. Ela tem uma permissão de med-tec, foi o que ela
disse.
– E ninguém veio me procurar ainda?
– Não.
– Isso é bom, Slick. Porque se alguém vier, qualquer outro
sem ser o rato mentiroso que é meuamigo Kid Afrika, você e teu pessoal estariam numa
encrenca séria.
– É?
– É. Presta atenção, quero que você lembre isso. Se
aparecer alguém nessa tal fábrica de vocês,
sua única esperança
Entendeu bem?
será
me
conectar
à
matrix.
– Como você pode ser o Conde? Quero dizer, o que isso
significa?
– Bobby. Meu nome é Bobby. Conde foi meu apelido um
dia, e isso é tudo. Você acha que vai se
lembrar do que eu disse?
Slick assentiu de novo.
– Bom. – Ele colocou o copo na coisa com todas as
garrafas chiques. – Ouça – disse ele. Da porta aberta veio
o som de pneus sobre o cascalho. – Sabe quem é, Slick?
Aquela é Angela Mitchell.
Slick se virou. Bobby, “o Conde”, estava olhando para
fora, para o caminho.
– Angie Mitchell? A estrela de stim? Ela está dentro desta
coisa também?
– De certa forma, Slick, de certa forma...
Slick viu o longo carro negro passar. – Ei – começou –,
Conde, quero dizer, Bobby, o que...– Calma – Gentry estava dizendo. – Fique sentado e
relaxe. Calma. Calma...

DE VOLTA PARA O LESTE
Enquanto Kelly e suas assistentes arrumavam o guarda-
roupa para sua viagem, ela se sentiu como se a própria
casa estivesse se movimentando ao seu redor,
preparando-se para um dos seus muitos períodos de
ociosidade.
Podia ouvir as vozes deles, de onde estava sentada na
sala de estar, suas risadas. Uma de suas assistentes era
uma garota num exoesqueleto de policarbono azul que
lhe permitia carregar as malas Hermès com o guarda-
roupas como se fossem blocos de espuma sem peso, o
traje esquelético e sussurrante descia suavemente a
escada, com passos acolchoados por seus rudes pés de
dinossauro.
Esqueleto azul, caixões de couro.
Agora Porphyre estava parado à porta. – Fofa, está
pronta? – Ele vestia um casaco longo e largo
recortado em um finíssimo couro preto; esporas com
imitações de diamantes brilhavam acima dos
saltos de suas botas pretas.
– Porphyre – disse ela –, você está à paisana. Nós temos
uma entrada triunfal a fazer, em Nova
York.– As câmeras são para você.
– Sim – respondeu ela –, para a minha reinserção.
– Porphyre ficará bem na retaguarda.
