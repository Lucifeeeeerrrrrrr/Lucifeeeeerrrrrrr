 wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on
either side, and displaying curiously fantastic tree-trunks in the light of our bobbing torches. All
were afoot save Libo, Balbutius, Asellius, two or three of the centuriones, and myself, and at
length the way became so steep and narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave
them; a squad of ten men being left to guard them, though robber bands were not likely to be
abroad on such a night of terror. Once in a while it seemed as though we detected a skulking
form in the woods nearby, and after a half-hour's climb the steepness and narrowness of the
way made the advance of so great a body of men—over 300, all told—exceedingly cumbrous
and difficult. Then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below.
It was from the tethered horses—they had screamed, not neighed, but screamed... and there
was no light down there, nor the sound of any human thing, to shew why they had done so. At
the same moment bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead, so that terror seemed to lurk
equally well before and behind us. Looking for the youth Vercellius, our guide, we found only
a crumpled heap weltering in a pool of blood. In his hand was a short sword snatched from
the belt of D. Vibulanus, a subcenturio, and on his face was such a look of terror that the
stoutest veterans turned pale at the sight. He had killed himself when the horses screamed...
he, who had been born and lived all his life in that region, and knew what men whispered
about the hills. All the torches now began to dim, and the cries of frightened legionaries
mingled with the unceasing screams of the tethered horses. The air grew perceptibly colder,
more suddenly so than is usual at November's brink, and seemed stirred by terrible
undulations which I could not help connecting with the beating of huge wings. The whole
cohort now remained at a standstill, and as the torches faded I watched what I thought were
fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by the spectral luminosity of the Via Lactea as it flowed
through Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cygnus. Then suddenly all the stars were blotted
from the sky—even bright Deneb and Vega ahead, and the lone Altair and Fomalhaut behind
us. And as the torches died out altogether, there remained above the stricken and shrieking
cohort only the noxious and horrible altar-flames on the towering peaks; hellish and red, and
now silhouetting the mad, leaping, and colossal forms of such nameless beasts as had never
a Phrygian priest or Campanian grandam whispered of in the wildest of furtive tales. And
above the nighted screaming of men and horses that dæmonic drumming rose to louder pitch,
whilst an ice-cold wind of shocking sentience and deliberateness swept down from those
forbidden heights and coiled about each man separately, till all the cohort was struggling and
screaming in the dark, as if acting out the fate of Laocoön and his sons. Only old Scribonius
Libo seemed resigned. He uttered words amidst the screaming, and they echo still in my ears.
―Malitia vetus—malitia vetus est . . . venit . . . tandem venit . . .”
And then I waked. It was the most vivid dream in years, drawing upon wells of the
subconscious long untouched and forgotten. Of the fate of that cohort no record exists, but
the town at least was saved—for encyclopædias tell of the survival of Pompelo to this day,
under the modern Spanish name of Pompelona. . . .

The Thing in the Moonlight
(1927)
Morgan is not a literary man; in fact he cannot speak English with any degree of coherency.
That is what makes me wonder about the words he wrote, though others have laughed.
He was alone the evening it happened. Suddenly an unconquerable urge to write came over
him, and taking pen in hand he wrote the following:
My name is Howard Phillips. I live at 66 College Street, in Providence, Rhode Island. On
November 24, 1927—for I know not even what the year may be now—, I fell asleep and
dreamed, since when I have been unable to awaken.
My dream began in a dank, reed-choked marsh that lay under a gray autumn sky, with a
rugged cliff of lichen-crusted stone rising to the north. Impelled by some obscure quest, I
ascended a rift or cleft in this beetling precipice, noting as I did so the black mouths of many
fearsome burrows extending from both walls into the depths of the stony plateau.
At several points the passage was roofed over by the choking of the upper parts of the narrow
fissure; these places being exceeding dark, and forbidding the perception of such burrows as
may have existed there. In one such dark space I felt conscious of a singular accession of
fright, as if some subtle and bodiless emanation from the abyss were engulfing my spirit; but
the blackness was too great for me to perceive the source of my alarm.
At length I emerged upon a tableland of moss-grown rock and scanty soil, lit by a faint
moonlight which had replaced the expiring orb of day. Casting my eyes about, I beheld no
living object; but was sensible of a very peculiar stirring far below me, amongst the whispering
rushes of the pestilential swamp I had lately quitted.
After walking for some distance, I encountered the rusty tracks of a street railway, and the
worm-eaten poles which still held the limp and sagging trolley wire. Following this line, I soon
came upon a yellow, vestibuled car numbered 1852—of a plain, double-trucked type common
from 1900 to 1910. It was untenanted, but evidently ready to start; the trolley being on the
wire and the air-brake now and then throbbing beneath the floor. I boarded it and looked
vainly about for the light switch—noting as I did so the absence of the controller handle, which
thus implied the brief absence of the motorman. Then I sat down in one of the cross seats of
the vehicle. Presently I heard a swishing in the sparse grass toward the left, and saw the dark
forms of two men looming up in the moonlight. They had the regulation caps of a railway
company, and I could not doubt but that they were conductor and motorman. Then one of
them sniffed with singular sharpness, and raised his face to howl to the moon. The other
dropped on all fours to run toward the car.
I leaped up at once and raced madly out of that car and across endless leagues of plateau till
exhaustion forced me to stop—doing this not because the conductor had dropped on all fours,
but because the face of the motorman was a mere white cone tapering to one blood-red-
tentacle. . . .
I was aware that I only dreamed, but the very awareness was not pleasant.
Since that fearful night, I have prayed only for awakening—it has not come!
Instead I have found myself an inhabitant of this terrible dream-world! That first night gave
way to dawn, and I wandered aimlessly over the lonely swamp-lands. When night came, I still
wandered, hoping for awakening. But suddenly I parted the weeds and saw before me the
ancient railway car—and to one side a cone-faced thing lifted its head and in the streaming
moonlight howled strangely!
It has been the same each day. Night takes me always to that place of horror. I have tried not
moving, with the coming of nightfall, but I must walk in my slumber, for always I awaken with
the thing of dread howling before me in the pale moonlight, and I turn and flee madly.
God! when will I awaken?
That is what Morgan wrote. I would go to 66 College Street in Providence, but I fear for what I
might find there.

The History of the Necronomicon
(1927)
Original title Al Azif—azif being the word used by Arabs to designate that nocturnal sound
(made by insects) suppos‘d to be the howling of daemons.
Composed by Abdul Alhazred, a mad poet of Sanaá, in Yemen, who is said to have flourished
during the period of the Ommiade caliphs, circa 700 A.D. He visited the ruins of Babylon and
the subterranean secrets of Memphis and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert
of Arabia—the Roba el Khaliyeh or ―Empty Space‖ of the ancients—and ―Dahna‖ or ―Crimson‖
desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and
monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those
who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in Damascus, where the
Necronomicon (Al Azif) was written, and of his final death or disappearance (738 A.D.) many
terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by Ebn Khallikan (12th cent. biographer) to
have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a
large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to
have seen fabulous Irem, or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain
nameless desert town the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was
only an indifferent Moslem, worshipping unknown entities whom he called Yog-Sothoth and
Cthulhu.
In A.D. 950 the Azif, which had gained a considerable tho‘ surreptitious circulation amongst
the philosophers of the age, was secretly translated into Greek by Theodorus Philetas of
Constantinople under the title Necronomicon. For a century it impelled certain experimenters
to terrible attempts, when it was suppressed and burnt by the patriarch Michael. After this it is
only heard of furtively, but (1228) Olaus Wormius made a Latin translation later in the Middle
Ages, and the Latin text was printed twice—once in the fifteenth century in black-letter
(evidently in Germany) and once in the seventeenth (prob. Spanish)—both editions being
without identifying marks, and located as to time and place by internal typographical evidence
only. The work both Latin and Greek was banned by Pope Gregory IX in 1232, shortly after its
Latin translation, which called attention to it. The Arabic original was lost as early as Wormius‘
time, as indicated by his prefatory note; and no sight of the Greek copy—which was printed in
Italy between 1500 and 1550—has been reported since the burning of a certain Salem man‘s
library in 1692. An English translation made by Dr. Dee was never printed, and exists only in
fragments recovered from the original manuscript. Of the Latin texts now existing one (15th
cent.) is known to be in the British Museum under lock and key, while another (17th cent.) is
in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. A seventeenth-century edition is in the Widener Library
at Harvard, and in the library of Miskatonic University at Arkham. Also in the library of the
University of Buenos Ayres. Numerous other copies probably exist in secret, and a fifteenth-
century one is persistently rumoured to form part of the collection of a celebrated American
millionaire. A still vaguer rumour credits the preservation of a sixteenth-century Greek text in
the Salem family of Pickman; but if it was so preserved, it vanished with the artist R.U.
Pickman, who disappeared early in 1926. The book is rigidly suppressed by the authorities of
most countries, and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism. Reading leads to terrible
consequences. It was from rumours of this book (of which relatively few of the general public
know) that R.W. Chambers is said to have derived the idea of his early novel The King in
Yellow.

Ibid
(1928)
(―. . . as Ibid says in his famous Lives of the Poets.‖
—From a student theme.)
The erroneous idea that Ibid is the author of the Lives is so frequently met with, even among
those pretending to a degree of culture, that it is worth correcting. It should be a matter of
general knowledge that Cf. is responsible for this work. Ibid‘s masterpiece, on the other hand,
was the famous Op. Cit. wherein all the significant undercurrents of Graeco-Roman
expression were crystallised once for all—and with admirable acuteness, notwithstanding the
surprisingly late date at which Ibid wrote. There is a false report—very commonly reproduced
in modern books prior to Von Schweinkopf‘s monumental Geschichte der Ostrogothen in
Italien—that Ibid was a Romanised Visigoth of Ataulf‘s horde who settled in Placentia about
410 A.D. The contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for Von Schweinkopf, and since his
time Littlewit 1 and Bêtenoir, 2 have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated
figure was a genuine Roman—or at least as genuine a Roman as that degenerate and
mongrelised age could produce—of whom one might well say what Gibbon said of Boethius,
―that he was the last whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman.‖ He
was, like Boethius and nearly all the eminent men of his age, of the great Anician family, and
traced his genealogy with much exactitude and self-satisfaction to all the heroes of the
republic. His full name—long and pompous according to the custom of an age which had lost
the trinomial simplicity of classic Roman nomenclature—is stated by Von Schweinkopf 3 to
have been Caius Anicius Magnus Furius Camillus Æmilianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius
Julius Ibidus; though Littlewit 4 rejects Æmilianus and adds Claudius Decius Junianus; whilst
Bêtenoir 5 differs radically, giving the full name as Magnus Furius Camillus Aurelius Antoninus
Flavius Anicius Petronius Valentinianus Aegidus Ibidus.
The eminent critic and biographer was born in the year 486, shortly after the extinction of the
Roman rule in Gaul by Clovis. Rome and Ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth,
though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of
Athens—the extent of whose suppression by Theodosius a century before is grossly
exaggerated by the superficial. In 512, under the benign rule of the Ostrogoth Theodoric, we
behold him as a teacher of rhetoric at Rome, and in 516 he held the consulship together with
Pompilius Numantius Bombastes Marcellinus Deodamnatus. Upon the death of Theodoric in
526, Ibidus retired from public life to compose his celebrated work (whose pure Ciceronian
style is as remarkable a case of classic atavism as is the verse of Claudius Claudianus, who
flourished a century before Ibidus); but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp to act as court
rhetorician for Theodatus, nephew of Theodoric.
Upon the usurpation of Vitiges, Ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a time imprisoned; but the
coming of the Byzantine-Roman army under Belisarius soon restored him to liberty and
honours. Throughout the siege of Rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders, and
afterward followed the eagles of Belisarius to Alba, Porto, and Centumcellae. After the
Frankish siege of Milan, Ibidus was chosen to accompany the learned Bishop Datius to
Greece, and resided with him at Corinth in the year 539. About 541 he removed to
Constantinopolis, where he received every mark of imperial favour both from Justinianus and
Justinus the Second. The Emperors Tiberius and Maurice did kindly honour to his old age,
and contributed much to his immortality—especially Maurice, whose delight it was to trace his
ancestry to old Rome notwithstanding his birth at Arabiscus, in Cappadocia. It was Maurice
who, in the poet‘s 101st year, secured the adoption of his work as a textbook in the schools of
the empire, an honour which proved a fatal tax on the aged rhetorician‘s emotions, since he
passed away peacefully at his home near the church of St. Sophia on the sixth day before the
Kalends of September, A.D. 587, in the 102nd year of his age.
His remains, notwithstanding the troubled state of Italy, were taken to Ravenna for interment;
but being interred in the suburb of Classe, were exhumed and ridiculed by the Lombard Duke
of Spoleto, who took his skull to King Autharis for use as a wassail-bowl. Ibid‘s skull was
proudly handed down from king to king of the Lombard line. Upon the capture of Pavia by
Charlemagne in 774, the skull was seized from the tottering Desiderius and carried in the train
of the Frankish conqueror. It was from this vessel, indeed, that Pope Leo administered the
royal unction which made of the hero-nomad a Holy Roman Emperor. Charlemagne took
Ibid‘s skull to his capital at Aix, soon afterward presenting it to his Saxon teacher Alcuin, upon
whose death in 804 it was sent to Alcuin‘s kinsfolk in England.
William the Conqueror, finding it in an abbey niche where the pious family of Alcuin had
placed it (believing it to be the skull of a saint 6 who had miraculously annihilated the
Lombards by his prayers), did reverence to its osseous antiquity; and even the rough soldiers
of Cromwell, upon destroying Ballylough Abbey in Ireland in 1650 (it having been secretly
transported thither by a devout Papist in 1539, upon Henry VIII‘s dissolution of the English
monasteries), declined to offer violence to a relic so venerable.
It was captured by the private soldier Read-‘em-and-Weep Hopkins, who not long after traded
it to Rest-in-Jehovah Stubbs for a quid of new Virginia weed. Stubbs, upon sending forth his
son Zerubbabel to seek his fortune in New England in 1661 (for he thought ill of the
Restoration atmosphere for a pious young yeoman), gave him St. Ibid‘s—or rather Brother
Ibid‘s, for he abhorred all that was Popish—skull as a talisman. Upon landing in Salem
Zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near
the town pump. However, he had not been wholly unaffected by the Restoration influence;
and having become addicted to gaming, lost the skull to one Epenetus Dexter, a visiting
freeman of Providence.
It was in the house of Dexter, in the northern part of the town near the present intersection of
North Main and Olney Streets, on the occasion of Canonchet‘s raid of March 30, 1676, during
King Philip‘s War; and the astute sachem, recognising it at once as a thing of singular
venerableness and dignity, sent it as a symbol of alliance to a faction of the Pequots in
Connecticut with whom he was negotiating. On April 4 he was captured by the colonists and
soon after executed, but the austere head of Ibid continued on its wanderings.
The Pequots, enfeebled by a previous war, could give the now stricken Narragansetts no
assistance; and in 1680 a Dutch fur-trader of Albany, Petrus van Schaack, secured the
distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders, he having recognised its value from
the half-effaced inscription carved in Lombardic minuscules (palaeography, it might be
explained, was one of the leading accomplishments of New-Netherland fur-traders of the
seventeenth century).
From van Schaack, sad to say, the relic was stolen in 1683 by a French trader, Jean Grenier,
whose Popish zeal recognised the features of one whom he had been taught at his mother‘s
knee to revere as St. Ibide. Grenier, fired with virtuous rage at the possession of this holy
symbol by a Protestant, crushed van Schaack‘s head one night with an axe and escaped to
the north with his booty; soon, however, being robbed and slain by the half-breed voyageur
Michel Savard, who took the skull—despite the illiteracy which prevented his recognising it—
to add to a collection of similar but more recent material.
Upon his death in 1701 his half-breed son Pierre traded it among other things to some
emissaries of the Sacs and Foxes, and it was found outside the chief‘s tepee a generation
later by Charles de Langlade, founder of the trading post at Green Bay, Wisconsin. De
Langlade regarded this sacred object with proper veneration and ransomed it at the expense
of many glass beads; yet after his time it found itself in many other hands, being traded to
settlements at the head of Lake Winnebago, to tribes around Lake Mendota, and finally, early
in the nineteenth century, to one Solomon Juneau, a Frenchman, at the new trading post of
Milwaukee on the Menominee River and the shore of Lake Michigan.
Later traded to Jacques Caboche, another settler, it was in 1850 lost in a game of chess or
poker to a newcomer named Hans Zimmerman; being used by him as a beer-stein until one
day, under the spell of its contents, he suffered it to roll from his front stoop to the prairie path
before his home—where, falling into the burrow of a prairie-dog, it passed beyond his power
of discovery or recovery upon his awaking.
So for generations did the sainted skull of Caius Anicius Magnus Furius Camillus Æmilianus
Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus, consul of Rome, favourite of emperors, and saint
of the Romish church, lie hidden beneath the soil of a growing town. At first worshipped with
dark rites by the prairie-dogs, who saw in it a deity sent from the upper world, it afterward fell
into dire neglect as the race of simple, artless burrowers succumbed before the onslaught of
the conquering Aryan. Sewers came, but they passed by it. Houses went up—2303 of them,
and more—and at last one fateful night a titan thing occurred. Subtle Nature, convulsed with a
spiritual ecstasy, like the froth of that region‘s quondam beverage, laid low the lofty and
heaved high the humble—and behold! In the roseal dawn the burghers of Milwaukee rose to
find a former prairie turned to a highland! Vast and far-reaching was the great upheaval.
Subterrene arcana, hidden for years, came at last to the light. For there, full in the rifted
roadway, lay bleached and tranquil in bland, saintly, and consular pomp the dome-like skull of
Ibid!

The Dunwich Horror
(1928)
―Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimaeras—dire stories of Celaeno and the Harpies—
may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition—but they were there before.
They are transcripts, types—the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else
should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to
affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered
in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of all! These
terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body—or without the body, they
would have been the same. . . . That the kind of fear here treated is purely
spiritual—that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it
predominates in the period of our sinless infancy—are difficulties the solution of
which might afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and a
peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.‖
—Charles Lamb: ―Witches and Other Night-Fears‖
I.
When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the
Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean‘s Corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country. The
ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the
ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the
wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At
the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely
scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. Without
knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and
then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so
silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would
be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above
the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded
and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky
silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of
them are crowned.
Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges
always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland
that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills
chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily
insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic‘s upper
reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills
among which it rises.
As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops.
Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their
distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a
small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and
wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than
that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the
houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours
the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous
tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the
impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and
decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road
around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury
pike. Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.
Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the
signboards pointing toward it have been taken down. The scenery, judged by any ordinary
aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer
tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest
presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In
our sensible age—since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the
town‘s and the world‘s welfare at heart—people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps
one reason—though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers—is that the natives are now
repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many
New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-
defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their
intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden
murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry,
representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept
somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid
populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of
the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though
those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their
ancestors were born.
No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just what is the
matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the
Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills,
and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from
the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational
Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan
and his imps; in which he said:
―It must be allow‘d, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are
Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny‘d; the cursed Voices of Azazel and
Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by above a
Score of credible Witnesses now living. I my self did not more than a Fortnight ago
catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein
there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no
Things of this Earth cou‘d raise up, and which must needs have come from those
Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.‖
Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the text, printed in Springfield,
is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year, and still form a
puzzle to geologists and physiographers.
Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing
airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great
ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil‘s Hop Yard—a bleak, blasted hillside where
no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then too, the natives are mortally afraid of the
numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are
psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eerie cries in
unison with the sufferer‘s struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves
the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they
subside gradually into a disappointed silence.
These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from very old
times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old—older by far than any of the communities within
thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the
ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built
in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here,
and the nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great
rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hill-tops, but these are more generally attributed to
the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and bones, found within these circles and
around the sizeable table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots
were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding
the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains Caucasian.
II.
It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a
hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur
Whateley was born at 5 A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was
recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under
another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the
countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was
the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed,
unattractive albino woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom
the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no
known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the
child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might—and did—speculate
as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-
looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was
heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future.
Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to
wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which
her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to
pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed
scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always
been feared because of Old Whateley‘s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained
death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to
make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and
grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by
household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since
disappeared.
There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs‘
barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming.
Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh
through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers
at Osborn‘s general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man—an added element
of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of
fear—though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he
shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child‘s
paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.
―I dun‘t keer what folks think—ef Lavinny‘s boy looked like his pa, he wouldn‘t look like nothin‘
ye expeck. Ye needn‘t think the only folks is the folks hereabaouts. Lavinny‘s read some, an‘
has seed some things the most o‘ ye only tell abaout. I calc‘late her man is as good a husban‘
as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an‘ ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye
wouldn‘t ast no better church weddin‘ nor her‘n. Let me tell ye suthin‘—some day yew folks’ll
hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill!”
The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah
Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer‘s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop.
Mamie‘s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her
observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had
bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of
small Wilbur‘s family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet
at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. There came a
period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed
precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more
than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper,
perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the
filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores,
having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or
twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about
the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.
In the spring after Wilbur‘s birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing
in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after
most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift
development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur‘s growth was indeed
phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power
not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds
shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really
unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which
another month was sufficient to remove.
It was somewhat after this time—on Hallowe‘en—that a great blaze was seen at midnight on
the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient
bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop—of the undecayed Bishops—
mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour
before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his
mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted
almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they
were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had
some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never
subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the
disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger
and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought
very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.
The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that ―Lavinny‘s black brat‖ had
commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat
remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and
because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four
might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some
elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not
reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with
his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect,
too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother‘s and grandfather‘s
chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large,
dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural
intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there
being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin,
coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than
his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the
bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful
name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms
before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive
measures against their barking menace.
III.
Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his
herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house—a spacious,
peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three
least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter.
There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to
accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his
carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation. It had already begun as soon as
Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order,
clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of
the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania shewed itself only in his tight
boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section—though many declared that it was a
crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another
downstairs room for his new grandson—a room which several callers saw, though no one was
ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm
shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting
ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously
in odd corners of the various rooms.
―I made some use of ‘em,‖ he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with
paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, ―but the boy‘s fitten to make better use of ‘em. He‘d
orter hev ‘em as well sot as he kin, for they‘re goin‘ to be all of his larnin‘.‖
When Wilbur was a year and seven months old—in September of 1914—his size and
accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a
fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and
accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the
queer pictures and charts in his grandfather‘s books, while Old Whateley would instruct and
catechise him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was
finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made
into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill;
and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground.
About the period of this work‘s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly
locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur‘s birth, had been abandoned again. The
door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling
call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered—such
a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles
on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then, the
homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.
The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but
steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May-Eve of 1915 there were tremors which
even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe‘en produced an underground
rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame—―them witch Whateleys‘ doin‘s‖—from
the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of
ten as he entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than
formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time people began to speak
specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an
unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of
unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of
wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in
safety. His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners
of canine guardians.
The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd
cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second story. She would never tell what her
father and the boy were doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an
abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading to the
stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a
horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway,
and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of
Old Whateley‘s youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock
is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that
dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and
feared young Wilbur personally.
In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had
hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp.
The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several
officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England
newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set
reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser
to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur‘s precociousness, Old Whateley‘s black
magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and
the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and
looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his
voice had begun to break.
Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and
called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed
upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool-shed abandoned
when the house was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he
caught near the stone circles on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they
appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made
so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely
ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though
they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk.
IV.
For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a
morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May-Eve and All-Hallows
orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the
mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there
were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time callers
professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs,
and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed.
There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but
nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world‘s
attention to themselves.
About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face
gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old
house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people
concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even
removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the
peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range
with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe.
In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that
would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to regard
the circumstance as one of great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn‘s that he
thought his time had almost come.
―They whistle jest in tune with my breathin‘ naow,‖ he said, ―an‘ I guess they‘re gittin‘ ready to
ketch my soul. They know it‘s a-goin‘ aout, an‘ dun‘t calc‘late to miss it. Yew‘ll know, boys,
arter I‘m gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they‘ll keep up a-singin‘ an‘ laffin‘ till
break o‘ day. Ef they dun‘t they‘ll kinder quiet daown like. I expeck them an‘ the souls they
hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes.‖
On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by Wilbur
Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned
from Osborn‘s in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac
action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter
and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead
there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on
some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds
outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in
repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It was uncanny and
unnatural—too much, thought Dr. Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so
reluctantly in response to the urgent call.
Toward one o‘clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his wheezing to
choke out a few words to his grandson.
―More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows—an‘ that grows faster. It‘ll be ready to sarve
ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye‘ll find on page 751
of the complete edition, an‘ then put a match to the prison. Fire from airth can‘t burn it
nohaow.‖
He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside
adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises
came from afar off, he added another sentence or two.
―Feed it reg‘lar, Willy, an‘ mind the quantity; but dun‘t let it grow too fast fer the place, fer ef it
busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it‘s all over an‘ no use. Only them
from beyont kin make it multiply an‘ work. . . . Only them, the old uns as wants to come back. .
. .‖
But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills
followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour, when the final throaty rattle
came. Dr. Houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds
faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises
rumbled faintly.
―They didn‘t git him,‖ he muttered in his heavy bass voice.
Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and
was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and
forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around
Dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door;
but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold
which still, as in his grandfather‘s time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying.
He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached the normal adult
limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent
from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was
fully six and three-quarters feet tall.
Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a growing
contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May-Eve and Hallowmass; and in
1926 the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.
―They‘s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,‖ she said, ―an‘ naowadays
they‘s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun‘t know what he wants nor what
he‘s a-tryin‘ to dew.‖
That Hallowe‘en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on Sentinel Hill as
usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally
belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley
farmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation
which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they
vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no
one could quite be certain till later. None of the country folk seemed to have died—but poor
Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never seen again.
In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his
books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn‘s that
more carpentry was going on in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors
and windows on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his
grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and
Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected
him of knowing something about his mother‘s disappearance, and very few ever approached
his neighbourhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and shewed no
signs of ceasing its development.
V.
The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur‘s first trip outside the
Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library at Harvard, the Bibliothèque
Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the University of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of
Miskatonic University of Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately
wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to
consult the copy at Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet
tall, and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn‘s general store, this dark and goatish
gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and
key at the college library—the hideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in
Olaus Wormius‘ Latin version, as printed in Spain in the seventeenth century. He had never
seen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds; where,
indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural
fury and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chain.
Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee‘s English version which his
grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to the Latin copy he at once
began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have
come on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could not civilly refrain
from telling the librarian—the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M. Miskatonic, Ph. D.
Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied
him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation
containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies,
duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy. As he
copied the formula he finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the
open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous
threats to the peace and sanity of the world.
―Nor is it to be thought,‖ ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, ―that man is
either the oldest or the last of earth‘s masters, or that the common bulk of life and
substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones
shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and
primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-
Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present,
future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of
old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod
earth‘s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them
as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their
semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have
begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from
man‘s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They
walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the
Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the
earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city,
yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste
hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and
the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who
hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed
and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. Iä!
Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats,
yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold.
Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now
where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer
is winter, and after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They
reign again.‖
Dr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of Dunwich and its
brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim, hideous aura that stretched from a
dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of
the tomb‘s cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of
another planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black gulfs
of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter,
space and time. Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange,
resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of mankind‘s.
―Mr. Armitage,‖ he said, ―I calc‘late I‘ve got to take that book home. They‘s things in it I‘ve got
to try under sarten conditions that I can‘t git here, an‘ it ‘ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape
rule hold me up. Let me take it along, Sir, an‘ I‘ll swar they wun‘t nobody know the difference. I
dun‘t need to tell ye I‘ll take good keer of it. It wa‘n‘t me that put this Dee copy in the shape it
is. . . .‖
He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian‘s face, and his own goatish features grew
crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed, thought
suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself. There was too much
responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley
saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.
―Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun‘t be so fussy as yew be.‖ And
without saying more he rose and strode out of the building, stooping at each doorway.
Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley‘s gorilla-like
lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window. He thought of the wild tales he
had heard, and recalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he
had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not
of earth—or at least not of tri-dimensional earth—rushed foetid and horrible through New
England‘s glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain-tops. Of this he had long felt
certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding
horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once
passive nightmare. He locked away the Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the
room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. ―As a foulness shall ye know
them,‖ he quoted. Yes—the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the
Whateley farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous,
once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage.
―Inbreeding?‖ Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. ―Great God, what simpletons! Shew
them Arthur Machen‘s Great God Pan and they‘ll think it a common Dunwich scandal! But
what thing—what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three-dimensioned earth—was
Wilbur Whateley‘s father? Born on Candlemas—nine months after May-Eve of 1912, when
the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham— What walked on the
mountains that May-Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human
flesh and blood?‖
During the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible data on Wilbur
Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in communication with Dr.
Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to
ponder over in the grandfather‘s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich
Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in
those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the
nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with
several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a
growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really
acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done
about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known
to the human world as Wilbur Whateley.
VI.
The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and Dr. Armitage
was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had heard, meanwhile, of
Whateley‘s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the
Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had
issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume.
Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally
anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.
Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of the 3d Dr.
Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the
college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always
in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from
a wholly different throat—such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted
their dreams ever afterward—such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or
wholly of earth.
Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college
buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still
shrilling from the library. An open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight. What
had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast
fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some
instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to
see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among
the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told
some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside.
The inward sounds, except for a watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite
subsided; but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills
among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with the
last breaths of a dying man.
The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew too well, and the three men
rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room whence the low whining came.
For a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then Armitage summoned up his courage and
snapped the switch. One of the three—it is not certain which—shrieked aloud at what
sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice
declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.
The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor and tarry
stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the
skin. It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in
monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-
leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window
an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a
revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been
fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and
not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that
it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely
bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was
partly human, beyond a doubt, with very man-like hands and head, and the goatish, chinless
face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the torso and lower parts of the body were
teratologically fabulous, so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on
earth unchallenged or uneradicated.
Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog‘s rending paws
still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back
was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain
snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and
sheer phantasy began. The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the
abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.
Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry
unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish,
ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended
a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being an
undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their black fur, roughly resembled the hind
legs of prehistoric earth‘s giant saurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were
neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed
colour, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the non-human side of its ancestry. In the
tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was
manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyish-white in the spaces
between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-yellow
ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a
curious discolouration behind it.
As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to mumble
without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage made no written record of its mouthings, but
asserts confidently that nothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all
correlation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came some disjointed
fragments evidently taken from the Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest of
which the thing had perished. These fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like
―N’gai, n’gha’ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y’hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth. . . .” They trailed off into
nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.
Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long, lugubrious howl. A
change came over the yellow, goatish face of the prostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell
in appallingly. Outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and
above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck whirring
and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight,
frantic at that which they had sought for prey.
All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and leaped nervously out of
the window by which it had entered. A cry rose from the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to
the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He
was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the dark
curtains carefully down over each one. By this time two policemen had arrived; and Dr.
Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone
entrance to the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could
be covered up.
Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need not describe the kind
and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and
Professor Rice; but it is permissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face
and hands, the really human element in Wilbur Whateley must have been very small. When
the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards, and
the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony
skeleton; at least, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his unknown
father.
VII.
Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through
by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were
sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the
late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the
growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the
surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by
Whateley‘s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during
Wilbur‘s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised
excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the
deceased‘s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous
report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in
progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper
Miskatonic valley.
An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and
adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship,
presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its
owner‘s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the
deceased‘s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best
linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold
with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.
It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very
pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th
noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o‘clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at
George Corey‘s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his
morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he
stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing
and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between
gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.
―Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis‘ Corey—they‘s suthin‘ ben thar! It smells like thunder,
an‘ all the bushes an‘ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they‘d a haouse ben moved
along of it. An‘ that ain‘t the wust, nuther. They‘s prints in the rud, Mis‘ Corey—great raound
prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s
a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an‘ I see every one
was covered with lines spreadin‘ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or
three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An‘ the smell was
awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley‘s ol‘ haouse. . . .‖
Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home.
Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus
starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally
Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop‘s, the nearest place to Whateley‘s, it became her turn to
listen instead of transmit; for Sally‘s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill
toward Whateley‘s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the
pasturage where Mr. Bishop‘s cows had been left out all night.
―Yes, Mis‘ Corey,‖ came Sally‘s tremulous voice over the party wire, ―Cha‘ncey he just come
back a-postin‘, and couldn‘t haff talk fer bein‘ scairt! He says Ol‘ Whateley‘s haouse is all
blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they‘d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom
floor ain‘t through, but is all covered with a kind o‘ tar-like stuff that smells awful an‘ drips
daown offen the aidges onto the graoun‘ whar the side timbers is blown away. An‘ they‘s awful
kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an‘ all
sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha‘ncey he says they leads off into the
medders, whar a great swath wider‘n a barn is matted daown, an‘ all the stun walls tumbled
every whichway wherever it goes.
―An‘ he says, says he, Mis‘ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth‘s caows, frighted ez he
was; an‘ faound ‘em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil‘s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on
‘em‘s clean gone, an‘ nigh haff o‘ them that‘s left is sucked most dry o‘ blood, with sores on
‘em like they‘s ben on Whateley‘s cattle ever senct Lavinny‘s black brat was born. Seth he‘s
gone aout naow to look at ‘em, though I‘ll vaow he wun‘t keer ter git very nigh Wizard
Whateley‘s! Cha‘ncey didn‘t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it
leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p‘inted towards the glen rud to the village.
―I tell ye, Mis‘ Corey, they‘s suthin‘ abroad as hadn‘t orter be abroad, an‘ I for one think that
black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin‘
of it. He wa‘n‘t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an‘ I think he an‘ Ol‘ Whateley
must a raised suthin‘ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain‘t even so human as he was. They‘s
allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin‘ things—as ain‘t human an‘ ain‘t good fer
human folks.
―The graoun‘ was a-talkin‘ lass night, an‘ towards mornin‘ Cha‘ncey he heerd the
whippoorwills so laoud in Col‘ Spring Glen he couldn‘t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd
another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley‘s—a kinder rippin‘ or tearin‘ o‘ wood,
like some big box er crate was bein‘ opened fur off. What with this an‘ that, he didn‘t git to
sleep at all till sunup, an‘ no sooner was he up this mornin‘, but he‘s got to go over to
Whateley‘s an‘ see what‘s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis‘ Corey! This dun‘t mean no
good, an‘ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an‘ do suthin‘. I know suthin‘
awful‘s abaout, an‘ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.
―Did your Luther take accaount o‘ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis‘ Corey, ef they
was on the glen rud this side o‘ the glen, an‘ ain‘t got to your haouse yet, I calc‘late they must
go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col‘ Spring Glen ain‘t no healthy nor
decent place. The whippoorwills an‘ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o‘
Gawd, an‘ they‘s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin‘ an‘ a-talkin‘ in the air
daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an‘ Bear‘s Den.‖
By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the
roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining
in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of
the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had
burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the
trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the
precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid
down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came,
but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to
stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in
its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed
and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript;
but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous
paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.
That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as
possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in
the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at
Elmer Frye‘s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a
sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed
telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering
wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly
followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and
crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit,
but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk
whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told
them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful
moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together
in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold
Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late
whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she
could of the second phase of the horror.
The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came
and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched
from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and
one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be
found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be
shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others
maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half
way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought
to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his
memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur
and his grandfather.
Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few
cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof;
but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile,
ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however,
occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that
the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed
an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual
example to the still reluctant majority.
When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling
together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported
excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers
noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As
before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous
bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two
directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it
along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings
led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular
places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer
stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill‘s
summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.
It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by
the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a
vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave
surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the
ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and
muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route
much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas
of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have
done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.
Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the
glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3
A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a
fright-mad voice shriek out, ―Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .‖ and some thought a crashing sound
followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do
anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it
called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an
hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the
head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and
monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and
amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry
stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich.
VIII.
In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been
blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious
manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for
translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both
ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily
shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority.
The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving
the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to
furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably
have used. The ancient books taken from Whateley‘s quarters, while absorbingly interesting
and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among
philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them,
a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet—this one of a very
different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length
given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage, both because of his peculiar interest in the
Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae
of antiquity and the Middle Ages.
Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain
forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have inherited many forms
and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not
deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if, as he
suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It was his belief that,
considering the great amount of text involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the
trouble of using another speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and
incantations. Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the
bulk of it was in English.
Dr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle was a deep
and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial. All through late
August he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography; drawing upon the fullest
resources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius‘
Poligraphia, Giambattista Porta‘s De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenère‘s Traité des
Chiffres, Falconer‘s Cryptomenysis Patefacta, Davys‘ and Thicknesse‘s eighteenth-century
treatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten, and Klüber‘s Kryptographik.
He interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time
became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of
cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the
multiplication table, and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the
initiated. The older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage
concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down
through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only to
be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds
began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged definitely
and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in English.
On the evening of September 2nd the last major barrier gave way, and Dr. Armitage read for
the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley‘s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all
had thought; and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and
general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage
deciphered, an entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was
written, he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or
thirteen.
―Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth,‖ it ran, ―which did not like, it being
answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me than
I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam
Hutchins‘ collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he
dast. I guess he won‘t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and
I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to those poles when
the earth is cleared off, if I can‘t break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I
commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I can clear
off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then, so I shall have to learn all
the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They
from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood. That
upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I make the Voorish
sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May-Eve on
the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall look when the
earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo
Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.‖
Morning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration. He
had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under the electric light turning page
after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously
telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the
house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted
maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner
were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward the middle of the next
night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as
hideous as the truths and menaces to man‘s existence that he had uncovered.
On the morning of September 4th Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan insisted on seeing him for a
while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he went to bed, but slept only
fitfully. Wednesday—the next day—he was back at the manuscript, and began to take copious
notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered. In the small
hours of that night he slept a little in an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript
again before dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see him and
insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for
him to complete the reading of the diary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.
That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted.
His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious
enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he
had taken. Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great
envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had sufficient strength to
get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once.
As the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, ―But what, in God’s
name, can we do?”
Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no explanations to Hartwell,
but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with Rice and
Morgan. His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that
something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan
for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by
some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world was
in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and
cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen,
vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the
Daemonolatreia of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check
the peril he conjured up.
―Stop them, stop them!‖ he would shout. ―Those Whateleys meant to let them in, and the
worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something—it‘s a blind business, but I
know how to make the powder. . . . It hasn‘t been fed since the second of August, when
Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . . .‖
But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off his disorder
that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober
with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to
go over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day
and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most
desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack
shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with
feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism there was none. All three had
seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building, and
after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman‘s
raving.
Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the negative finally
won. There were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not
seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at
night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday
Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college
laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the
efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left
behind him—the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few
hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror.
Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task in hand required an infinity
of research and experiment. Further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about
various changes of plan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must
remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a
trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely
away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated
Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of Dunwich had raised up.
Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they
discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage
knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to
annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him.
IX.
Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, arriving at the
village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a
kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the
deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt
circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn‘s
store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the
Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich;
questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with
rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the
blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous
swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed
to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar-like
stone on the summit.
At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from Aylesbury that
morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the
officers and compare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more easily
planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction. There had
been five of them in a car, but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The
natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage
and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging
Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by.
―Gawd,‖ he gasped, ―I telled ‘em not ter go daown into the glen, an‘ I never thought nobody‘d
dew it with them tracks an‘ that smell an‘ the whippoorwills a-screechin‘ daown thar in the dark
o‘ noonday. . . .‖
A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed strained in a kind
of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror
and its monstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon
fall, and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course.
Negotium perambulans in tenebris. . . . The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had
memorised, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised. He
saw that his electric flashlight was in working order. Rice, beside him, took from a valise a
metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle
on which he relied despite his colleague‘s warnings that no material weapon would be of help.
Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to
expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He
hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it
had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward,
anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and
bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose.
They shook their heads at the visitors‘ plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near the glen; and
as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.
There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped threateningly.
Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable
foetor to the heavy night air; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once
before, when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a
human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen
was biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in
the dark.
Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day, with now and
then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up
beyond the hills to the northwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking
shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings,
they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen
in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant
peals of thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then a forky bolt
flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed glen itself. The sky grew very dark,
and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear
weather.
It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel of voices
sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a
dozen men, running, shouting, and even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began
sobbing out words, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed a
coherent form.
―Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,‖ the voice choked out. ―It‘s a-goin‘ agin, an’ this time by day! It‘s
aout—it‘s aout an‘ a-movin‘ this very minute, an‘ only the Lord knows when it‘ll be on us all!‖
The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.
―Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the ‘phone a-ringin‘, an‘ it was Mis‘ Corey,
George‘s wife, that lives daown by the junction. She says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin‘
in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin‘ at the
maouth o‘ the glen—opposite side ter this—an‘ smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when
he faound the big tracks las‘ Monday mornin‘. An‘ she says he says they was a swishin‘,
lappin‘ sound, more nor what the bendin‘ trees an‘ bushes could make, an‘ all on a suddent
the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an‘ they was a awful stompin‘ an‘
splashin‘ in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn‘t see nothin‘ at all, only just the bendin‘ trees
an‘ underbrush.
―Then fur ahead where Bishop‘s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin‘ an‘
strainin‘ on the bridge, an‘ says he could tell the saound o‘ wood a-startin‘ to crack an‘ split.
An‘ all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees an‘ bushes a-bendin‘. An‘ when the
swishin‘ saound got very fur off—on the rud towards Wizard Whateley‘s an‘ Sentinel Hill—
Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he‘d heerd it furst an‘ look at the graound. It was all
mud an‘ water, an‘ the sky was dark, an‘ the rain was wipin‘ aout all tracks abaout as fast as
could be; but beginnin‘ at the glen maouth, whar the trees had moved, they was still some o‘
them awful prints big as bar‘ls like he seen Monday.‖
At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.
―But that ain‘t the trouble naow—that was only the start. Zeb here was callin‘ folks up an‘
everybody was a-listenin‘ in when a call from Seth Bishop‘s cut in. His haousekeeper Sally
was carryin‘ on fit ter kill—she‘d jest seed the trees a-bendin‘ beside the rud, an‘ says they
was a kind o‘ mushy saound, like a elephant puffin‘ an‘ treadin‘, a-headin‘ fer the haouse.
Then she up an‘ spoke suddent of a fearful smell, an‘ says her boy Cha‘ncey was a-screamin‘
as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin‘. An‘ the
dogs was all barkin‘ an‘ whinin‘ awful.
―An‘ then she let aout a turrible yell, an‘ says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the
storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa‘n‘t strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-
listenin‘, an‘ we could hear lots o‘ folks on the wire a-gaspin‘. All to onct Sally she yelled agin,
an‘ says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up, though they wa‘n‘t no sign o‘ what
done it. Then everybody on the line could hear Cha‘ncey an‘ ol‘ Seth Bishop a-yellin‘ tew, an‘
Sally was shriekin‘ aout that suthin‘ heavy hed struck the haouse—not lightnin‘ nor nothin‘, but
suthin‘ heavy agin the front, that kep‘ a-launchin‘ itself agin an‘ agin, though ye couldn‘t see
nothin‘ aout the front winders. An‘ then . . . an‘ then . . .‖
Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was, had barely poise
enough to prompt the speaker.
―An‘ then . . . Sally she yelled aout, ‘O help, the haouse is a-cavin‘ in‘ . . . an‘ on the wire we
could hear a turrible crashin‘, an‘ a hull flock o‘ screamin‘ . . . jest like when Elmer Frye‘s place
was took, only wuss. . . .‖
The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.
―That‘s all—not a saound nor squeak over the ‘phone arter that. Jest still-like. We that heerd it
got aout Fords an‘ wagons an‘ raounded up as many able-bodied menfolks as we could git, at
Corey‘s place, an‘ come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I think
it‘s the Lord‘s jedgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.‖
Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to the faltering
group of frightened rustics.
―We must follow it, boys.‖ He made his voice as reassuring as possible. ―I believe there‘s a
chance of putting it out of business. You men know that those Whateleys were wizards—well,
this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I‘ve seen Wilbur
Whateley‘s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know
the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course, one can‘t be sure, but
we can always take a chance. It‘s invisible—I knew it would be—but there‘s a powder in this
long-distance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second. Later on we‘ll try it. It‘s a
frightful thing to have alive, but it isn‘t as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he‘d lived
longer. You‘ll never know what the world has escaped. Now we‘ve only this one thing to fight,
and it can‘t multiply. It can, though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn‘t hesitate to rid the
community of it.
―We must follow it—and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked. Let
somebody lead the way—I don‘t know your roads very well, but I‘ve an idea there might be a
shorter cut across lots. How about it?‖
The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing with a grimy
finger through the steadily lessening rain.
―I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop‘s quickest by cuttin‘ acrost the lower medder here, wadin‘
the brook at the low place, an‘ climbin‘ through Carrier‘s mowin‘ and the timber-lot beyont.
That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth‘s—a leetle t‘other side.‖
Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and most of the
natives followed slowly. The sky was growing lighter, and there were signs that the storm had
worn itself away. When Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned
him and walked ahead to shew the right one. Courage and confidence were mounting; though
the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut,
and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these
qualities to a severe test.
At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They were a little beyond
the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks shewed what had
passed by. Only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend.
It was the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was found in either of the
collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house and barn. No one cared to remain there
amidst the stench and tarry stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints
leading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of Sentinel
Hill.
As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley‘s abode they shuddered visibly, and seemed
again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke tracking down something as big as a
house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon. Opposite
the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh bending and matting
visible along the broad swath marking the monster‘s former route to and from the summit.
Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green
side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose sight was keener. After a
moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a
certain spot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical
devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with Armitage‘s aid. When
he did so his cry was less restrained than Morgan‘s had been.
―Gawd almighty, the grass an‘ bushes is a-movin‘! It‘s a-goin‘ up—slow-like—creepin‘ up ter
the top this minute, heaven only knows what fur!‖
Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one thing to chase the
nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells might be all right—but suppose they
weren‘t? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply
seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of
Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind.
X.
In the end the three men from Arkham—old, white-bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron-grey
Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan—ascended the mountain alone. After much
patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened
group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those
among whom the glass was passed around. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be
helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish
maker re-passed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were
gaining.
Curtis Whateley—of the undecayed branch—was holding the telescope when the Arkham
party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the men were evidently trying
to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of
where the shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were
seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it.
Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was adjusting the
sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to happen. The crowd stirred
uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of
visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope
and strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party‘s point of vantage
above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with
marvellous effect.
Those without the telescope saw only an instant‘s flash of grey cloud—a cloud about the size
of a moderately large building—near the top of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the
instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled,
and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him.
All he could do was moan half-inaudibly,
―Oh, oh, great Gawd . . . that . . . that . . .‖
There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to rescue the
fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all coherence, and even isolated
replies were almost too much for him.
―Bigger‘n a barn . . . all made o‘ squirmin‘ ropes . . . hull thing sort o‘ shaped like a hen‘s egg
bigger‘n anything, with dozens o‘ legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step . . .
nothin‘ solid abaout it—all like jelly, an‘ made o‘ sep‘rit wrigglin‘ ropes pushed clost together . .
. great bulgin‘ eyes all over it . . . ten or twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin‘ aout all along the
sides, big as stovepipes, an‘ all a-tossin‘ an‘ openin‘ an‘ shuttin‘ . . . all grey, with kinder blue or
purple rings . . . an’ Gawd in heaven—that haff face on top! . . .‖
This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and he collapsed
completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will Hutchins carried him to the roadside
and laid him on the damp grass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on
the mountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures,
apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed. Only these—
nothing more. Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley
behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered
whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil
expectancy.
Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the
topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable distance from it. One
figure, he said, seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and as
Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound
from the distance, as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette
on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and
impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation. ―I guess he‘s
sayin‘ the spell,‖ whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills
were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible
ritual.
Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud. It
was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly marked by all. A rumbling sound seemed
brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came
from the sky. Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents
of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw
through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some
farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs.
The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed about the horizon in
wonder. A purplish darkness, born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky‘s
blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat
brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the
altar-stone on the distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that
instant. The whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich braced
themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed
surcharged.
Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the
memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any human throat were they born, for
the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they
came from the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the
peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-
bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet one
must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words.
They were loud—loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed—yet did
they come from no visible being. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source
in the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain‘s base huddled still
closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.
―Ygnaiih . . . ygnaiih . . . thflthkh’ngha . . . Yog-Sothoth . . .” rang the hideous croaking out of
space. ―Y’bthnk . . . h’ehye—n’grkdl’lh. . . .”
The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle were going
on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely
silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as
their incantation drew near its culmination. From what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling,
from what unplumbed gulfs of extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity,
were those half-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed
force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.
―Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah—e’yayayayaaaa . . . ngh’aaaaa . . . ngh’aaaa . . . h‘yuh . . . h‘yuh . . .
HELP! HELP! . . . ff—ff—ff—FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH! . . .‖
But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably English syllables
that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking
altar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the
terrific report which seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source,
be it inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning-bolt shot from the
purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable
stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were
whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain‘s base, weakened by the lethal
foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled
from the distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over
field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.
The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day there is
something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill. Curtis
Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down
the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave
and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those
which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of
questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.
―The thing has gone forever,‖ Armitage said. ―It has been split up into what it was originally
made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in a normal world. Only the least
fraction was really matter in any sense we know. It was like its father—and most of it has
gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe; some
vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have
called him for a moment on the hills.‖
There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis Whateley
began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan.
Memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had
prostrated him burst in upon him again.
―Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face—that haff face on top of it . . . that face with the red eyes an’
crinkly albino hair, an’ no chin, like the Whateleys . . . It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind
o’ thing, but they was a haff-shaped man’s face on top of it, an’ it looked like Wizard
Whateley’s, only it was yards an’ yards acrost. . . .”
He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite
crystallised into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who wanderingly remembered
ancient things but who had been silent heretofore, spoke aloud.
―Fifteen year‘ gone,‖ he rambled, ―I heerd Ol‘ Whateley say as haow some day we‘d hear a
child o‘ Lavinny‘s a-callin‘ its father‘s name on the top o‘ Sentinel Hill. . . .‖
But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.
―What was it anyhaow, an‘ haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o‘ the air it come
from?‖
Armitage chose his words very carefully.
―It was—well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn‘t belong in our part of space; a kind of
force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We
have no business calling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people and very
wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself—enough to make a
devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I‘m
going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you‘ll dynamite that altar-stone up
there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills. Things like that brought
down the beings those Whateleys were so fond of—the beings they were going to let in
tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some
nameless purpose.
―But as to this thing we‘ve just sent back—the Whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the
doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and
big—but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn‘t ask
how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn‘t call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked
more like the father than he did.”

The Whisperer in Darkness
(1930)
I.
Bear in mind closely that I did not see any actual visual horror at the end. To say that a mental
shock was the cause of what I inferred—that last straw which sent me racing out of the lonely
Akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills of Vermont in a commandeered motor at
night—is to ignore the plainest facts of my final experience. Notwithstanding the deep extent
to which I shared the information and speculations of Henry Akeley, the things I saw and
heard, and the admitted vividness of the impression produced on me by these things, I cannot
prove even now whether I was right or wrong in my hideous inference. For after all, Akeley‘s
disappearance establishes nothing. People found nothing amiss in his house despite the
bullet-marks on the outside and inside. It was just as though he had walked out casually for a
ramble in the hills and failed to return. There was not even a sign that a guest had been there,
or that those horrible cylinders and machines had been stored in the study. That he had
mortally feared the crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had
been born and reared, means nothing at all, either; for thousands are subject to just such
morbid fears. Eccentricity, moreover, could easily account for his strange acts and
apprehensions toward the last.
The whole matter began, so far as I am concerned, with the historic and unprecedented
Vermont floods of November 3, 1927. I was then, as now, an instructor of literature at
Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts, and an enthusiastic amateur student of New
England folklore. Shortly after the flood, amidst the varied reports of hardship, suffering, and
organised relief which filled the press, there appeared certain odd stories of things found
floating in some of the swollen rivers; so that many of my friends embarked on curious
discussions and appealed to me to shed what light I could on the subject. I felt flattered at
having my folklore study taken so seriously, and did what I could to belittle the wild, vague
tales which seemed so clearly an outgrowth of old rustic superstitions. It amused me to find
several persons of education who insisted that some stratum of obscure, distorted fact might
underlie the rumours.
The tales thus brought to my notice came mostly through newspaper cuttings; though one
yarn had an oral source and was repeated to a friend of mine in a letter from his mother in
Hardwick, Vermont. The type of thing described was essentially the same in all cases, though
there seemed to be three separate instances involved—one connected with the Winooski
River near Montpelier, another attached to the West River in Windham County beyond
Newfane, and a third centring in the Passumpsic in Caledonia County above Lyndonville. Of
course many of the stray items mentioned other instances, but on analysis they all seemed to
boil down to these three. In each case country folk reported seeing one or more very bizarre
and disturbing objects in the surging waters that poured down from the unfrequented hills,
and there was a widespread tendency to connect these sights with a primitive, half-forgotten
cycle of whispered legend which old people resurrected for the occasion.
What people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they had ever seen
before. Naturally, there were many human bodies washed along by the streams in that tragic
period; but those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that they were not
human, despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline. Nor, said the
witnesses, could they have been any kind of animal known to Vermont. They were pinkish
things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or
membraneous wings and several sets of articulated limbs, and with a sort of convoluted
ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be. It
was really remarkable how closely the reports from different sources tended to coincide;
though the wonder was lessened by the fact that the old legends, shared at one time
throughout the hill country, furnished a morbidly vivid picture which might well have coloured
the imaginations of all the witnesses concerned. It was my conclusion that such witnesses—in
every case naive and simple backwoods folk—had glimpsed the battered and bloated bodies
of human beings or farm animals in the whirling currents; and had allowed the half-
remembered folklore to invest these pitiful objects with fantastic attributes.
The ancient folklore, while cloudy, evasive, and largely forgotten by the present generation,
was of a highly singular character, and obviously reflected the influence of still earlier Indian
tales. I knew it well, though I had never been in Vermont, through the exceedingly rare
monograph of Eli Davenport, which embraces material orally obtained prior to 1839 among
the oldest people of the state. This material, moreover, closely coincided with tales which I
had personally heard from elderly rustics in the mountains of New Hampshire. Briefly
summarised, it hinted at a hidden race of monstrous beings which lurked somewhere among
the remoter hills—in the deep woods of the highest peaks, and the dark valleys where
streams trickle from unknown sources. These beings were seldom glimpsed, but evidences of
their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of
certain mountains or into certain deep, steep-sided gorges that even the wolves shunned.
There were queer footprints or claw-prints in the mud of brook-margins and barren patches,
and curious circles of stones, with the grass around them worn away, which did not seem to
have been placed or entirely shaped by Nature. There were, too, certain caves of
problematical depth in the sides of the hills; with mouths closed by boulders in a manner
scarcely accidental, and with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both
toward and away from them—if indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated.
And worst of all, there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in the
twilight of the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above the limits of normal
hill-climbing.
It would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these things had not agreed so
well. As it was, nearly all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the
creatures were a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great bat-
like wings in the middle of the back. They sometimes walked on all their legs, and sometimes
on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey large objects of indeterminate nature.
On one occasion they were spied in considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading
along a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once
a specimen was seen flying—launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at night and
vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been silhouetted an instant against the
full moon.
These things seemed content, on the whole, to let mankind alone; though they were at times
held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individuals—especially persons who
built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up on certain mountains. Many localities
came to be known as inadvisable to settle in, the feeling persisting long after the cause was
forgotten. People would look up at some of the neighbouring mountain-precipices with a
shudder, even when not recalling how many settlers had been lost, and how many
farmhouses burnt to ashes, on the lower slopes of those grim, green sentinels.
But while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only
those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men,
and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world. There were tales of the
queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning, and of occasional
disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing
voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads
and cart-paths in the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or
heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards. In the final layer of
legends—the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close
contact with the dreaded places—there are shocked references to hermits and remote
farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change,
and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the
strange beings. In one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to
accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred
things.
As to what the things were—explanations naturally varied. The common name applied to
them was ―those ones‖, or ―the old ones‖, though other terms had a local and transient use.
Perhaps the bulk of the Puritan settlers set them down bluntly as familiars of the devil, and
made them a basis of awed theological speculation. Those with Celtic legendry in their
heritage—mainly the Scotch-Irish element of New Hampshire, and their kindred who had
settled in Vermont on Governor Wentworth‘s colonial grants—linked them vaguely with the
malign fairies and ―little people‖ of the bogs and raths, and protected themselves with scraps
of incantation handed down through many generations. But the Indians had the most fantastic
theories of all. While different tribal legends differed, there was a marked consensus of belief
in certain vital particulars; it being unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to
this earth.
The Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taught that the
Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in our earthly hills whence
they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world. They did not live here, said
the myths, but merely maintained outposts and flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their
own stars in the north. They harmed only those earth-people who got too near them or spied
upon them. Animals shunned them through instinctive hatred, not because of being hunted.
They could not eat the things and animals of earth, but brought their own food from the stars.
It was bad to get near them, and sometimes young hunters who went into their hills never
came back. It was not good, either, to listen to what they whispered at night in the forest with
voices like a bee‘s that tried to be like the voices of men. They knew the speech of all kinds of
men—Pennacooks, Hurons, men of the Five Nations—but did not seem to have or need any
speech of their own. They talked with their heads, which changed colour in different ways to
mean different things.
All the legendry, of course, white and Indian alike, died down during the nineteenth century,
except for occasional atavistical flareups. The ways of the Vermonters became settled; and
once their habitual paths and dwellings were established according to a certain fixed plan,
they remembered less and less what fears and avoidances had determined that plan, and
even that there had been any fears or avoidances. Most people simply knew that certain hilly
regions were considered as highly unhealthy, unprofitable, and generally unlucky to live in,
and that the farther one kept from them the better off one usually was. In time the ruts of
custom and economic interest became so deeply cut in approved places that there was no
longer any reason for going outside them, and the haunted hills were left deserted by accident
rather than by design. Save during infrequent local scares, only wonder-loving grandmothers
and retrospective nonagenarians ever whispered of beings dwelling in those hills; and even
such whisperers admitted that there was not much to fear from those things now that they
were used to the presence of houses and settlements, and now that human beings let their
chosen territory severely alone.
All this I had known from my reading, and from certain folk-tales picked up in New Hampshire;
hence when the flood-time rumours began to appear, I could easily guess what imaginative
background had evolved them. I took great pains to explain this to my friends, and was
correspondingly amused when several contentious souls continued to insist on a possible
element of truth in the reports. Such persons tried to point out that the early legends had a
significant persistence and uniformity, and that the virtually unexplored nature of the Vermont
hills made it unwise to be dogmatic about what might or might not dwell among them; nor
could they be silenced by my assurance that all the myths were of a well-known pattern
common to most of mankind and determined by early phases of imaginative experience which
always produced the same type of delusion.
It was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the Vermont myths differed but little in
essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled the ancient world
with fauns and dryads and satyrs, suggested the kallikanzari of modern Greece, and gave to
wild Wales and Ireland their dark hints of strange, small, and terrible hidden races of
troglodytes and burrowers. No use, either, to point out the even more startlingly similar belief
of the Nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded Mi-Go or ―Abominable Snow-Men‖ who lurk
hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the Himalayan summits. When I brought up
this evidence, my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it must imply some actual
historicity for the ancient tales; that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder
earth-race, driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind, which might very
conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times—or even to the
present.
The more I laughed at such theories, the more these stubborn friends asseverated them;
adding that even without the heritage of legend the recent reports were too clear, consistent,
detailed, and sanely prosaic in manner of telling, to be completely ignored. Two or three
fanatical extremists went so far as to hint at possible meanings in the ancient Indian tales
which gave the hidden beings a non-terrestrial origin; citing the extravagant books of Charles
Fort with their claims that voyagers from other worlds and outer space have often visited
earth. Most of my foes, however, were merely romanticists who insisted on trying to transfer
to real life the fantastic lore of lurking ―little people‖ made popular by the magnificent horror-
fiction of Arthur Machen.
II.
As was only natural under the circumstances, this piquant debating finally got into print in the
form of letters to the Arkham Advertiser; some of which were copied in the press of those
Vermont regions whence the flood-stories came. The Rutland Herald gave half a page of
extracts from the letters on both sides, while the Brattleboro Reformer reprinted one of my
long historical and mythological summaries in full, with some accompanying comments in
―The Pendrifter‘s‖ thoughtful column which supported and applauded my sceptical
conclusions. By the spring of 1928 I was almost a well-known figure in Vermont,
notwithstanding the fact that I had never set foot in the state. Then came the challenging
letters from Henry Akeley which impressed me so profoundly, and which took me for the first
and last time to that fascinating realm of crowded green precipices and muttering forest
streams.
Most of what I now know of Henry Wentworth Akeley was gathered by correspondence with
his neighbours, and with his only son in California, after my experience in his lonely
farmhouse. He was, I discovered, the last representative on his home soil of a long, locally
distinguished line of jurists, administrators, and gentlemen-agriculturists. In him, however, the
family mentally had veered away from practical affairs to pure scholarship; so that he had
been a notable student of mathematics, astronomy, biology, anthropology, and folklore at the
University of Vermont. I had never previously heard of him, and he did not give many
autobiographical details in his communications; but from the first I saw he was a man of
character, education, and intelligence, albeit a recluse with very little worldly sophistication.
Despite the incredible nature of what he claimed, I could not help at once taking Akeley more
seriously than I had taken any of the other challengers of my views. For one thing, he was
really close to the actual phenomena—visible and tangible—that he speculated so
grotesquely about; and for another thing, he was amazingly willing to leave his conclusions in
a tentative state like a true man of science. He had no personal preferences to advance, and
was always guided by what he took to be solid evidence. Of course I began by considering
him mistaken, but gave him credit for being intelligently mistaken; and at no time did I emulate
some of his friends in attributing his ideas, and his fear of the lonely green hills, to insanity. I
could see that there was a great deal to the man, and knew that what he reported must surely
come from strange circumstances deserving investigation, however little it might have to do
with the fantastic causes he assigned. Later on I received from him certain material proofs
which placed the matter on a somewhat different and bewilderingly bizarre basis.
I cannot do better than transcribe in full, so far as is possible, the long letter in which Akeley
introduced himself, and which formed such an important landmark in my own intellectual
history. It is no longer in my possession, but my memory holds almost every word of its
portentous message; and again I affirm my confidence in the sanity of the man who wrote it.
Here is the text—a text which reached me in the cramped, archaic-looking scrawl of one who
had obviously not mingled much with the world during his sedate, scholarly life.
R.F.D. #2,
Townshend, Windham Co.,
Vermont.
May 5, 1928.
Albert N. Wilmarth, Esq.,
118 Saltonstall St.,
Arkham, Mass.,
My dear Sir:—
I have read with great interest the Brattleboro Reformer‘s reprint (Apr. 23, ‘28) of
your letter on the recent stories of strange bodies seen floating in our flooded
streams last fall, and on the curious folklore they so well agree with. It is easy to
see why an outlander would take the position you take, and even why ―Pendrifter‖
agrees with you. That is the attitude generally taken by educated persons both in
and out of Vermont, and was my own attitude as a young man (I am now 57)
before my studies, both general and in Davenport‘s book, led me to do some
exploring in parts of the hills hereabouts not usually visited.
I was directed toward such studies by the queer old tales I used to hear from
elderly farmers of the more ignorant sort, but now I wish I had let the whole matter
alone. I might say, with all proper modesty, that the subject of anthropology and
folklore is by no means strange to me. I took a good deal of it at college, and am
familiar with most of the standard authorities such as Tylor, Lubbock, Frazer,
Quatrefages, Murray, Osborn, Keith, Boule, G. Elliot Smith, and so on. It is no news
to me that tales of hidden races are as old as all mankind. I have seen the reprints
of letters from you, and those arguing with you, in the Rutland Herald, and guess I
know about where your controversy stands at the present time.
What I desire to say now is, that I am afraid your adversaries are nearer right than
yourself, even though all reason seems to be on your side. They are nearer right
than they realise themselves—for of course they go only by theory, and cannot
know what I know. If I knew as little of the matter as they, I would not feel justified
in believing as they do. I would be wholly on your side.
You can see that I am having a hard time getting to the point, probably because I
really dread getting to the point; but the upshot of the matter is that I have certain
evidence that monstrous things do indeed live in the woods on the high hills which
nobody visits. I have not seen any of the things floating in the rivers, as reported,
but I have seen things like them under circumstances I dread to repeat. I have
seen footprints, and of late have seen them nearer my own home (I live in the old
Akeley place south of Townshend Village, on the side of Dark Mountain) than I dare
tell you now. And I have overheard voices in the woods at certain points that I will
not even begin to describe on paper.
At one place I heard them so much that I took a phonograph there—with a
dictaphone attachment and wax blank—and I shall try to arrange to have you hear
the record I got. I have run it on the machine for some of the old people up here,
and one of the voices had nearly scared them paralysed by reason of its likeness
to a certain voice (that buzzing voice in the woods which Davenport mentions) that
their grandmothers have told about and mimicked for them. I know what most
people think of a man who tells about ―hearing voices‖—but before you draw
conclusions just listen to this record and ask some of the older backwoods people
what they think of it. If you can account for it normally, very well; but there must be
something behind it. Ex nihilo nihil fit, you know.
Now my object in writing you is not to start an argument, but to give you
information which I think a man of your tastes will find deeply interesting. This is
private. Publicly I am on your side, for certain things shew me that it does not do
for people to know too much about these matters. My own studies are now wholly
private, and I would not think of saying anything to attract people‘s attention and
cause them to visit the places I have explored. It is true—terribly true—that there
are non-human creatures watching us all the time; with spies among us gathering
information. It is from a wretched man who, if he was sane (as I think he was), was
one of those spies, that I got a large part of my clues to the matter. He later killed
himself, but I have reason to think there are others now.
The things come from another planet, being able to live in interstellar space and fly
through it on clumsy, powerful wings which have a way of resisting the ether but
which are too poor at steering to be of much use in helping them about on earth. I
will tell you about this later if you do not dismiss me at once as a madman. They
come here to get metals from mines that go deep under the hills, and I think I know
where they come from. They will not hurt us if we let them alone, but no one can
say what will happen if we get too curious about them. Of course a good army of
men could wipe out their mining colony. That is what they are afraid of. But if that
happened, more would come from outside—any number of them. They could easily
conquer the earth, but have not tried so far because they have not needed to. They
would rather leave things as they are to save bother.
I think they mean to get rid of me because of what I have discovered. There is a
great black stone with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which I found in the
woods on Round Hill, east of here; and after I took it home everything became
different. If they think I suspect too much they will either kill me or take me off the
earth to where they come from. They like to take away men of learning once in a
while, to keep informed on the state of things in the human world.
This leads me to my secondary purpose in addressing you—namely, to urge you to
hush up the present debate rather than give it more publicity. People must be kept
away from these hills, and in order to effect this, their curiosity ought not to be
aroused any further. Heaven knows there is peril enough anyway, with promoters
and real estate men flooding Vermont with herds of summer people to overrun the
wild places and cover the hills with cheap bungalows.
I shall welcome further communication with you, and shall try to send you that
phonograph record and black stone (which is so worn that photographs don‘t shew
much) by express if you are willing. I say ―try‖ because I think those creatures have
a way of tampering with things around here. There is a sullen, furtive fellow named
Brown, on a farm near the village, who I think is their spy. Little by little they are
trying to cut me off from our world because I know too much about their world.
They have the most amazing way of finding out what I do. You may not even get
this letter. I think I shall have to leave this part of the country and go to live with my
son in San Diego, Cal., if things get any worse, but it is not easy to give up the
place you were born in, and where your family has lived for six generations. Also, I
would hardly dare sell this house to anybody now that the creatures have taken
notice of it. They seem to be trying to get the black stone back and destroy the
phonograph record, but I shall not let them if I can help it. My great police dogs
always hold them back, for there are very few here as yet, and they are clumsy in
getting about. As I have said, their wings are not much use for short flights on
earth. I am on the very brink of deciphering that stone—in a very terrible way—and
with your knowledge of folklore you may be able to supply missing links enough to
help me. I suppose you know all about the fearful myths antedating the coming of
man to the earth—the Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu cycles—which are hinted at in the
Necronomicon. I had access to a copy of that once, and hear that you have one in
your college library under lock and key.
To conclude, Mr. Wilmarth, I think that with our respective studies we can be very
useful to each other. I don‘t wish to put you in any peril, and suppose I ought to
warn you that possession of the stone and the record won‘t be very safe; but I think
you will find any risks worth running for the sake of knowledge. I will drive down to
Newfane or Brattleboro to send whatever you authorise me to send, for the
express offices there are more to be trusted. I might say that I live quite alone now,
since I can‘t keep hired help any more. They won‘t stay because of the things that
try to get near the house at night, and that keep the dogs barking continually. I am
glad I didn‘t get as deep as this into the business while my wife was alive, for it
would have driven her mad.
Hoping that I am not bothering you unduly, and that you will decide to get in touch
with me rather than throw this letter into the waste basket as a madman‘s raving, I
am
Yrs. very truly,
HENRY W. AKELEY
P.S. I am making some extra prints of certain photographs taken by me, which I
think will help to prove a number of the points I have touched on. The old people
think they are monstrously true. I shall send you these very soon if you are
interested. H.W.A.
It would be difficult to describe my sentiments upon reading this strange document for the first
time. By all ordinary rules, I ought to have laughed more loudly at these extravagances than
at the far milder theories which had previously moved me to mirth; yet something in the tone
of the letter made me take it with paradoxical seriousness. Not that I believed for a moment in
the hidden race from the stars which my correspondent spoke of; but that, after some grave
preliminary doubts, I grew to feel oddly sure of his sanity and sincerity, and of his
confrontation by some genuine though singular and abnormal phenomenon which he could
not explain except in this imaginative way. It could not be as he thought it, I reflected, yet on
the other hand it could not be otherwise than worthy of investigation. The man seemed unduly
excited and alarmed about something, but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking. He
was so specific and logical in certain ways—and after all, his yarn did fit in so perplexingly
well with some of the old myths—even the wildest Indian legends.
That he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills, and had really found the black
stone he spoke about, was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences he had made—
inferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be a spy of the outer beings
and had later killed himself. It was easy to deduce that this man must have been wholly
insane, but that he probably had a streak of perverse outward logic which made the naive
Akeley—already prepared for such things by his folklore studies—believe his tale. As for the
latest developments—it appeared from his inability to keep hired help that Akeley‘s humbler
rustic neighbours were as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny things at
night. The dogs really barked, too.
And then the matter of that phonograph record, which I could not but believe he had obtained
in the way he said. It must mean something; whether animal noises deceptively like human
speech, or the speech of some hidden, night-haunting human being decayed to a state not
much above that of lower animals. From this my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphed
stone, and to speculations upon what it might mean. Then, too, what of the photographs
which Akeley said he was about to send, and which the old people had found so convincingly
terrible?
As I re-read the cramped handwriting I felt as never before that my credulous opponents
might have more on their side than I had conceded. After all, there might be some queer and
perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those shunned hills, even though no such race of
star-born monsters as folklore claimed. And if there were, then the presence of strange bodies
in the flooded streams would not be wholly beyond belief. Was it too presumptuous to
suppose that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind
them? But even as I harboured these doubts I felt ashamed that so fantastic a piece of
bizarrerie as Henry Akeley‘s wild letter had brought them up.
In the end I answered Akeley‘s letter, adopting a tone of friendly interest and soliciting further
particulars. His reply came almost by return mail; and contained, true to promise, a number of
kodak views of scenes and objects illustrating what he had to tell. Glancing at these pictures
as I took them from the envelope, I felt a curious sense of fright and nearness to forbidden
things; for in spite of the vagueness of most of them, they had a damnably suggestive power
which was intensified by the fact of their being genuine photographs—actual optical links with
what they portrayed, and the product of an impersonal transmitting process without prejudice,
fallibility, or mendacity.
The more I looked at them, the more I saw that my serious estimate of Akeley and his story
had not been unjustified. Certainly, these pictures carried conclusive evidence of something in
the Vermont hills which was at least vastly outside the radius of our common knowledge and
belief. The worst thing of all was the footprint—a view taken where the sun shone on a mud
patch somewhere in a deserted upland. This was no cheaply counterfeited thing, I could see
at a glance; for the sharply defined pebbles and grass-blades in the field of vision gave a
clear index of scale and left no possibility of a tricky double exposure. I have called the thing a
―footprint‖, but ―claw-print‖ would be a better term. Even now I can scarcely describe it save to
say that it was hideously crab-like, and that there seemed to be some ambiguity about its
direction. It was not a very deep or fresh print, but seemed to be about the size of an average
man‘s foot. From a central pad, pairs of saw-toothed nippers projected in opposite
directions—quite baffling as to function, if indeed the whole object were exclusively an organ
of locomotion.
Another photograph—evidently a time-exposure taken in deep shadow—was of the mouth of
a woodland cave, with a boulder of rounded regularity choking the aperture. On the bare
ground in front of it one could just discern a dense network of curious tracks, and when I
studied the picture with a magnifier I felt uneasily sure that the tracks were like the one in the
other view. A third picture shewed a druid-like circle of standing stones on the summit of a wild
hill. Around the cryptic circle the grass was very much beaten down and worn away, though I
could not detect any footprints even with the glass. The extreme remoteness of the place was
apparent from the veritable sea of tenantless mountains which formed the background and
stretched away toward a misty horizon.
But if the most disturbing of all the views was that of the footprint, the most curiously
suggestive was that of the great black stone found in the Round Hill woods. Akeley had
photographed it on what was evidently his study table, for I could see rows of books and a
bust of Milton in the background. The thing, as nearly as one might guess, had faced the
camera vertically with a somewhat irregularly curved surface of one by two feet; but to say
anything definite about that surface, or about the general shape of the whole mass, almost
defies the power of language. What outlandish geometrical principles had guided its cutting—
for artificially cut it surely was—I could not even begin to guess; and never before had I seen
anything which struck me as so strangely and unmistakably alien to this world. Of the
hieroglyphics on the surface I could discern very few, but one or two that I did see gave me
rather a shock. Of course they might be fraudulent, for others besides myself had read the
monstrous and abhorred Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; but it nevertheless
made me shiver to recognise certain ideographs which study had taught me to link with the
most blood-curdling and blasphemous whispers of things that had had a kind of mad half-
existence before the earth and the other inner worlds of the solar system were made.
Of the five remaining pictures, three were of swamp and hill scenes which seemed to bear
traces of hidden and unwholesome tenancy. Another was of a queer mark in the ground very
near Akeley‘s house, which he said he had photographed the morning after a night on which
the dogs had barked more violently than usual. It was very blurred, and one could really draw
no certain conclusions from it; but it did seem fiendishly like that other mark or claw-print
photographed on the deserted upland. The final picture was of the Akeley place itself; a trim
white house of two stories and attic, about a century and a quarter old, and with a well-kept
lawn and stone-bordered path leading up to a tastefully carved Georgian doorway. There
were several huge police dogs on the lawn, squatting near a pleasant-faced man with a close-
cropped grey beard whom I took to be Akeley himself—his own photographer, one might infer
from the tube-connected bulb in his right hand.
From the pictures I turned to the bulky, closely written letter itself; and for the next three hours
was immersed in a gulf of unutterable horror. Where Akeley had given only outlines before, he
now entered into minute details; presenting long transcripts of words overheard in the woods
at night, long accounts of monstrous pinkish forms spied in thickets at twilight on the hills, and
a terrible cosmic narrative derived from the application of profound and varied scholarship to
the endless bygone discourses of the mad self-styled spy who had killed himself. I found
myself faced by names and terms that I had heard elsewhere in the most hideous of
connexions—Yuggoth, Great Cthulhu, Tsathoggua, Yog-Sothoth, R‘lyeh, Nyarlathotep,
Azathoth, Hastur, Yian, Leng, the Lake of Hali, Bethmoora, the Yellow Sign, L‘mur-Kathulos,
Bran, and the Magnum Innominandum—and was drawn back through nameless aeons and
inconceivable dimensions to worlds of elder, outer entity at which the crazed author of the
Necronomicon had only guessed in the vaguest way. I was told of the pits of primal life, and of
the streams that had trickled down therefrom; and finally, of the tiny rivulet from one of those
streams which had become entangled with the destinies of our own earth.
My brain whirled; and where before I had attempted to explain things away, I now began to
believe in the most abnormal and incredible wonders. The array of vital evidence was
damnably vast and overwhelming; and the cool, scientific attitude of Akeley—an attitude
removed as far as imaginable from the demented, the fanatical, the hysterical, or even the
extravagantly speculative—had a tremendous effect on my thought and judgment. By the time
I laid the frightful letter aside I could understand the fears he had come to entertain, and was
ready to do anything in my power to keep people away from those wild, haunted hills. Even
now, when time has dulled the impression and made me half question my own experience
and horrible doubts, there are things in that letter of Akeley‘s which I would not quote, or even
form into words on paper. I am almost glad that the letter and record and photographs are
gone now—and I wish, for reasons I shall soon make clear, that the new planet beyond
Neptune had not been discovered.
With the reading of that letter my public debating about the Vermont horror permanently
ended. Arguments from opponents remained unanswered or put off with promises, and
eventually the controversy petered out into oblivion. During late May and June I was in
constant correspondence with Akeley; though once in a while a letter would be lost, so that
we would have to retrace our ground and perform considerable laborious copying. What we
were trying to do, as a whole, was to compare notes in matters of obscure mythological
scholarship and arrive at a clearer correlation of the Vermont horrors with the general body of
primitive world legend.
For one thing, we virtually decided that these morbidities and the hellish Himalayan Mi-Go
were one and the same order of incarnated nightmare. There were also absorbing zoölogical
conjectures, which I would have referred to Professor Dexter in my own college but for
Akeley‘s imperative command to tell no one of the matter before us. If I seem to disobey that
command now, it is only because I think that at this stage a warning about those farther
Vermont hills—and about those Himalayan peaks which bold explorers are more and more
determined to ascend—is more conducive to public safety than silence would be. One
specific thing we were leading up to was a deciphering of the hieroglyphics on that infamous
black stone—a deciphering which might well place us in possession of secrets deeper and
more dizzying than any formerly known to man.
III.
Toward the end of June the phonograph record came—shipped from Brattleboro, since
Akeley was unwilling to trust conditions on the branch line north of there. He had begun to
feel an increased sense of espionage, aggravated by the loss of some of our letters; and said
much about the insidious deeds of certain men whom he considered tools and agents of the
hidden beings. Most of all he suspected the surly farmer Walter Brown, who lived alone on a
run-down hillside place near the deep woods, and who was often seen loafing around corners
in Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Newfane, and South Londonderry in the most inexplicable and
seemingly unmotivated way. Brown‘s voice, he felt convinced, was one of those he had
overheard on a certain occasion in a very terrible conversation; and he had once found a
footprint or claw-print near Brown‘s house which might possess the most ominous
significance. It had been curiously near some of Brown‘s own footprints—footprints that faced
toward it.
So the record was shipped from Brattleboro, whither Akeley drove in his Ford car along the
lonely Vermont back roads. He confessed in an accompanying note that he was beginning to
be afraid of those roads, and that he would not even go into Townshend for supplies now
except in broad daylight. It did not pay, he repeated again and again, to know too much
unless one were very remote from those silent and problematical hills. He would be going to
California pretty soon to live with his son, though it was hard to leave a place where all one‘s
memories and ancestral feelings centred.
Before trying the record on the commercial machine which I borrowed from the college
administration building I carefully went over all the explanatory matter in Akeley‘s various
letters. This record, he had said, was obtained about 1 a.m. on the first of May, 1915, near the
closed mouth of a cave where the wooded west slope of Dark Mountain rises out of Lee‘s
Swamp. The place had always been unusually plagued with strange voices, this being the
reason he had brought the phonograph, dictaphone, and blank in expectation of results.
Former experience had told him that May-Eve—the hideous Sabbat-night of underground
European legend—would probably be more fruitful than any other date, and he was not
disappointed. It was noteworthy, though, that he never again heard voices at that particular
spot.
Unlike most of the overheard forest voices, the substance of the record was quasi-ritualistic,
and included one palpably human voice which Akeley had never been able to place. It was
not Brown‘s, but seemed to be that of a man of greater cultivation. The second voice,
however, was the real crux of the thing—for this was the accursed buzzing which had no
likeness to humanity despite the human words which it uttered in good English grammar and
a scholarly accent.
The recording phonograph and dictaphone had not worked uniformly well, and had of course
been at a great disadvantage because of the remote and muffled nature of the overheard
ritual; so that the actual speech secured was very fragmentary. Akeley had given me a
transcript of what he believed the spoken words to be, and I glanced through this again as I
prepared the machine for action. The text was darkly mysterious rather than openly horrible,
though a knowledge of its origin and manner of gathering gave it all the associative horror
which any words could well possess. I will present it here in full as I remember it—and I am
fairly confident that I know it correctly by heart, not only from reading the transcript, but from
playing the record itself over and over again. It is not a thing which one might readily forget!

(SPEECH CUT OFF BY END OF RECORD)
Such were the words for which I was to listen when I started the phonograph. It was with a
trace of genuine dread and reluctance that I pressed the lever and heard the preliminary
scratching of the sapphire point, and I was glad that the first faint, fragmentary words were in
a human voice—a mellow, educated voice which seemed vaguely Bostonian in accent, and
which was certainly not that of any native of the Vermont hills. As I listened to the tantalisingly
feeble rendering, I seemed to find the speech identical with Akeley‘s carefully prepared
transcript. On it chanted, in that mellow Bostonian voice . . . ―Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat
with a Thousand Young! . . .‖
And then I heard the other voice. To this hour I shudder retrospectively when I think of how it
struck me, prepared though I was by Akeley‘s accounts. Those to whom I have since
described the record profess to find nothing but cheap imposture or madness in it; but could
they have heard the accursed thing itself, or read the bulk of Akeley‘s correspondence
(especially that terrible and encyclopaedic second letter), I know they would think differently. It
is, after all, a tremendous pity that I did not disobey Akeley and play the record for others—a
tremendous pity, too, that all of his letters were lost. To me, with my first-hand impression of
the actual sounds, and with my knowledge of the background and surrounding circumstances,
the voice was a monstrous thing. It swiftly followed the human voice in ritualistic response, but
in my imagination it was a morbid echo winging its way across unimaginable abysses from
unimaginable outer hells. It is more than two years now since I last ran off that blasphemous
waxen cylinder; but at this moment, and at all other moments, I can still hear that feeble,
fiendish buzzing as it reached me for the first time.
―Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!”
But though that voice is always in my ears, I have not even yet been able to analyse it well
enough for a graphic description. It was like the drone of some loathsome, gigantic insect
ponderously shaped into the articulate speech of an alien species, and I am perfectly certain
that the organs producing it can have no resemblance to the vocal organs of man, or indeed
to those of any of the mammalia. There were singularities in timbre, range, and overtones
which placed this phenomenon wholly outside the sphere of humanity and earth-life. Its
sudden advent that first time almost stunned me, and I heard the rest of the record through in
a sort of abstracted daze. When the longer passage of buzzing came, there was a sharp
intensification of that feeling of blasphemous infinity which had struck me during the shorter
and earlier passage. At last the record ended abruptly, during an unusually clear speech of
the human and Bostonian voice; but I sat stupidly staring long after the machine had
automatically stopped.
I hardly need say that I gave that shocking record many another playing, and that I made
exhaustive attempts at analysis and comment in comparing notes with Akeley. It would be
both useless and disturbing to repeat here all that we concluded; but I may hint that we
agreed in believing we had secured a clue to the source of some of the most repulsive
primordial customs in the cryptic elder religions of mankind. It seemed plain to us, also, that
there were ancient and elaborate alliances between the hidden outer creatures and certain
members of the human race. How extensive these alliances were, and how their state today
might compare with their state in earlier ages, we had no means of guessing; yet at best there
was room for a limitless amount of horrified speculation. There seemed to be an awful,
immemorial linkage in several definite stages betwixt man and nameless infinity. The
blasphemies which appeared on earth, it was hinted, came from the dark planet Yuggoth, at
the rim of the solar system; but this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful
interstellar race whose ultimate source must lie far outside even the Einsteinian space-time
continuum or greatest known cosmos.
Meanwhile we continued to discuss the black stone and the best way of getting it to Arkham—
Akeley deeming it inadvisable to have me visit him at the scene of his nightmare studies. For
some reason or other, Akeley was afraid to trust the thing to any ordinary or expected
transportation route. His final idea was to take it across county to Bellows Falls and ship it on
the Boston and Maine system through Keene and Winchendon and Fitchburg, even though
this would necessitate his driving along somewhat lonelier and more forest-traversing hill
roads than the main highway to Brattleboro. He said he had noticed a man around the
express office at Brattleboro when he had sent the phonograph record, whose actions and
expression had been far from reassuring. This man had seemed too anxious to talk with the
clerks, and had taken the train on which the record was shipped. Akeley confessed that he
had not felt strictly at ease about that record until he heard from me of its safe receipt.
About this time—the second week in July—another letter of mine went astray, as I learned
through an anxious communication from Akeley. After that he told me to address him no more
at Townshend, but to send all mail in care of the General Delivery at Brattleboro; whither he
would make frequent trips either in his car or on the motor-coach line which had lately
replaced passenger service on the lagging branch railway. I could see that he was getting
more and more anxious, for he went into much detail about the increased barking of the dogs
on moonless nights, and about the fresh claw-prints he sometimes found in the road and in
the mud at the back of his farmyard when morning came. Once he told about a veritable army
of prints drawn up in a line facing an equally thick and resolute line of dog-tracks, and sent a
loathsomely disturbing kodak picture to prove it. That was after a night on which the dogs had
outdone themselves in barking and howling.
On the morning of Wednesday, July 18, I received a telegram from Bellows Falls, in which
Akeley said he was expressing the black stone over the B. & M. on Train No. 5508, leaving
Bellows Falls at 12:15 p.m., standard time, and due at the North Station in Boston at 4:12
p.m. It ought, I calculated, to get up to Arkham at least by the next noon; and accordingly I
stayed in all Thursday morning to receive it. But noon came and went without its advent, and
when I telephoned down to the express office I was informed that no shipment for me had
arrived. My next act, performed amidst a growing alarm, was to give a long-distance call to
the express agent at the Boston North Station; and I was scarcely surprised to learn that my
consignment had not appeared. Train No. 5508 had pulled in only 35 minutes late on the day
before, but had contained no box addressed to me. The agent promised, however, to institute
a searching inquiry; and I ended the day by sending Akeley a night-letter outlining the
situation.
With commendable promptness a report came from the Boston office on the following
afternoon, the agent telephoning as soon as he learned the facts. It seemed that the railway
express clerk on No. 5508 had been able to recall an incident which might have much bearing
on my loss—an argument with a very curious-voiced man, lean, sandy, and rustic-looking,
when the train was waiting at Keene, N.H., shortly after one o‘clock standard time.
The man, he said, was greatly excited about a heavy box which he claimed to expect, but
which was neither on the train nor entered on the company‘s books. He had given the name
of Stanley Adams, and had had such a queerly thick droning voice, that it made the clerk
abnormally dizzy and sleepy to listen to him. The clerk could not remember quite how the
conversation had ended, but recalled starting into a fuller awakeness when the train began to
move. The Boston agent added that this clerk was a young man of wholly unquestioned
veracity and reliability, of known antecedents and long with the company.
That evening I went to Boston to interview the clerk in person, having obtained his name and
address from the office. He was a frank, prepossessing fellow, but I saw that he could add
nothing to his original account. Oddly, he was scarcely sure that he could even recognise the
strange inquirer again. Realising that he had no more to tell, I returned to Arkham and sat up
till morning writing letters to Akeley, to the express company, and to the police department and
station agent in Keene. I felt that the strange-voiced man who had so queerly affected the
clerk must have a pivotal place in the ominous business, and hoped that Keene station
employees and telegraph-office records might tell something about him and about how he
happened to make his inquiry when and where he did.
I must admit, however, that all my investigations came to nothing. The queer-voiced man had
indeed been noticed around the Keene station in the early afternoon of July 18, and one
lounger seemed to couple him vaguely with a heavy box; but he was altogether unknown, and
had not been seen before or since. He had not visited the telegraph office or received any
message so far as could be learned, nor had any message which might justly be considered a
notice of the black stone‘s presence on No. 5508 come through the office for anyone.
Naturally Akeley joined with me in conducting these inquiries, and even made a personal trip
to Keene to question the people around the station; but his attitude toward the matter was
more fatalistic than mine. He seemed to find the loss of the box a portentous and menacing
fulfilment of inevitable tendencies, and had no real hope at all of its recovery. He spoke of the
undoubted telepathic and hypnotic powers of the hill creatures and their agents, and in one
letter hinted that he did not believe the stone was on this earth any longer. For my part, I was
duly enraged, for I had felt there was at least a chance of learning profound and astonishing
things from the old, blurred hieroglyphs. The matter would have rankled bitterly in my mind
had not Akeley‘s immediate subsequent letters brought up a new phase of the whole horrible
hill problem which at once seized all my attention.
IV.
The unknown things, Akeley wrote in a script grown pitifully tremulous, had begun to close in
on him with a wholly new degree of determination. The nocturnal barking of the dogs
whenever the moon was dim or absent was hideous now, and there had been attempts to
molest him on the lonely roads he had to traverse by day. On the second of August, while
bound for the village in his car, he had found a tree-trunk laid in his path at a point where the
highway ran through a deep patch of woods; while the savage barking of the two great dogs
he had with him told all too well of the things which must have been lurking near. What would
have happened had the dogs not been there, he did not dare guess—but he never went out
now without at least two of his faithful and powerful pack. Other road experiences had
occurred on August 5th and 6th; a shot grazing his car on one occasion, and the barking of
the dogs telling of unholy woodland presences on the other.
On August 15th I received a frantic letter which disturbed me greatly, and which made me
wish Akeley could put aside his lonely reticence and call in the aid of the law. There had been
frightful happenings on the night of the 12-13th, bullets flying outside the farmhouse, and
three of the twelve great dogs being found shot dead in the morning. There were myriads of
claw-prints in the road, with the human prints of Walter Brown among them. Akeley had
started to telephone to Brattleboro for more dogs, but the wire had gone dead before he had a
chance to say much. Later he went to Brattleboro in his car, and learned there that linemen
had found the main telephone cable neatly cut at a point where it ran through the deserted
hills north of Newfane. But he was about to start home with four fine new dogs, and several
cases of ammunition for his big-game repeating rifle. The letter was written at the post office
in Brattleboro, and came through to me without delay.
My attitude toward the matter was by this time quickly slipping from a scientific to an
alarmedly personal one. I was afraid for Akeley in his remote, lonely farmhouse, and half
afraid for myself because of my now definite connexion with the strange hill problem. The
thing was reaching out so. Would it suck me in and engulf me? In replying to his letter I urged
him to seek help, and hinted that I might take action myself if he did not. I spoke of visiting
Vermont in person in spite of his wishes, and of helping him explain the situation to the proper
authorities. In return, however, I received only a telegram from Bellows Falls which read thus:
APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION BUT CAN DO NOTHING. TAKE NO ACTION
YOURSELF FOR IT COULD ONLY HARM BOTH. WAIT FOR EXPLANATION.
HENRY AKELY
But the affair was steadily deepening. Upon my replying to the telegram I received a shaky
note from Akeley with the astonishing news that he had not only never sent the wire, but had
not received the letter from me to which it was an obvious reply. Hasty inquiries by him at
Bellows Falls had brought out that the message was deposited by a strange sandy-haired
man with a curiously thick, droning voice, though more than this he could not learn. The clerk
shewed him the original text as scrawled in pencil by the sender, but the handwriting was
wholly unfamiliar. It was noticeable that the signature was misspelled—A-K-E-L-Y, without the
second ―E‖. Certain conjectures were inevitable, but amidst the obvious crisis he did not stop
to elaborate upon them.
He spoke of the death of more dogs and the purchase of still others, and of the exchange of
gunfire which had become a settled feature each moonless night. Brown‘s prints, and the
prints of at least one or two more shod human figures, were now found regularly among the
claw-prints in the road, and at the back of the farmyard. It was, Akeley admitted, a pretty bad
business; and before long he would probably have to go to live with his California son whether
or not he could sell the old place. But it was not easy to leave the only spot one could really
think of as home. He must try to hang on a little longer; perhaps he could scare off the
intruders—especially if he openly gave up all further attempts to penetrate their secrets.
Writing Akeley at once, I renewed my offers of aid, and spoke again of visiting him and
helping him convince the authorities of his dire peril. In his reply he seemed less set against
that plan than his past attitude would have led one to predict, but said he would like to hold off
a little while longer—long enough to get his things in order and reconcile himself to the idea of
leaving an almost morbidly cherished birthplace. People looked askance at his studies and
speculations, and it would be better to get quietly off without setting the countryside in a
turmoil and creating widespread doubts of his own sanity. He had had enough, he admitted,
but he wanted to make a dignified exit if he could.
This letter reached me on the twenty-eighth of August, and I prepared and mailed as
encouraging a reply as I could. Apparently the encouragement had effect, for Akeley had
fewer terrors to report when he acknowledged my note. He was not very optimistic, though,
and expressed the belief that it was only the full moon season which was holding the
creatures off. He hoped there would not be many densely cloudy nights, and talked vaguely of
boarding in Brattleboro when the moon waned. Again I wrote him encouragingly, but on
September 5th there came a fresh communication which had obviously crossed my letter in
the mails; and to this I could not give any such hopeful response. In view of its importance I
believe I had better give it in full—as best I can do from memory of the shaky script. It ran
substantially as follows:
Monday.
Dear Wilmarth—
A rather discouraging P.S. to my last. Last night was thickly cloudy—though no
rain—and not a bit of moonlight got through. Things were pretty bad, and I think the
end is getting near, in spite of all we have hoped. After midnight something landed
on the roof of the house, and the dogs all rushed up to see what it was. I could
hear them snapping and tearing around, and then one managed to get on the roof
by jumping from the low ell. There was a terrible fight up there, and I heard a
frightful buzzing which I‘ll never forget. And then there was a shocking smell. About
the same time bullets came through the window and nearly grazed me. I think the
main line of the hill creatures had got close to the house when the dogs divided
because of the roof business. What was up there I don‘t know yet, but I‘m afraid
the creatures are learning to steer better with their space wings. I put out the light
and used the windows for loopholes, and raked all around the house with rifle fire
aimed just high enough not to hit the dogs. That seemed to end the business, but
in the morning I found great pools of blood in the yard, beside pools of a green
sticky stuff that had the worst odour I have ever smelled. I climbed up on the roof
and found more of the sticky stuff there. Five of the dogs were killed—I‘m afraid I
hit one by aiming too low, for he was shot in the back. Now I am setting the panes
the shots broke, and am going to Brattleboro for more dogs. I guess the men at the
kennels think I am crazy. Will drop another note later. Suppose I‘ll be ready for
moving in a week or two, though it nearly kills me to think of it.
Hastily—
AKELEY
But this was not the only letter from Akeley to cross mine. On the next morning—September
6th—still another came; this time a frantic scrawl which utterly unnerved me and put me at a
loss what to say or do next. Again I cannot do better than quote the text as faithfully as
memory will let me.
Tuesday.
Clouds didn‘t break, so no moon again—and going into the wane anyhow. I‘d have
the house wired for electricity and put in a searchlight if I didn‘t know they‘d cut the
cables as fast as they could be mended.
I think I am going crazy. It may be that all I have ever written you is a dream or
madness. It was bad enough before, but this time it is too much. They talked to me
last night—talked in that cursed buzzing voice and told me things that I dare not
repeat to you. I heard them plainly over the barking of the dogs, and once when
they were drowned out a human voice helped them. Keep out of this, Wilmarth—it
is worse than either you or I ever suspected. They don’t mean to let me get to
California now—they want to take me off alive, or what theoretically and mentally
amounts to alive—not only to Yuggoth, but beyond that—away outside the galaxy
and possibly beyond the last curved rim of space. I told them I wouldn‘t go where
they wish, or in the terrible way they propose to take me, but I‘m afraid it will be no
use. My place is so far out that they may come by day as well as by night before
long. Six more dogs killed, and I felt presences all along the wooded parts of the
road when I drove to Brattleboro today.
It was a mistake for me to try to send you that phonograph record and black stone.
Better smash the record before it‘s too late. Will drop you another line tomorrow if
I‘m still here. Wish I could arrange to get my books and things to Brattleboro and
board there. I would run off without anything if I could, but something inside my
mind holds me back. I can slip out to Brattleboro, where I ought to be safe, but I
feel just as much a prisoner there as at the house. And I seem to know that I
couldn‘t get much farther even if I dropped everything and tried. It is horrible—don‘t
get mixed up in this.
Yrs—AKELEY
I did not sleep at all the night after receiving this terrible thing, and was utterly baffled as to
Akeley‘s remaining degree of sanity. The substance of the note was wholly insane, yet the
manner of expression—in view of all that had gone before—had a grimly potent quality of
convincingness. I made no attempt to answer it, thinking it better to wait until Akeley might
have time to reply to my latest communication. Such a reply indeed came on the following
day, though the fresh material in it quite overshadowed any of the points brought up by the
letter it nominally answered. Here is what I recall of the text, scrawled and blotted as it was in
the course of a plainly frantic and hurried composition.
Wednesday.
W—
Yr letter came, but it‘s no use to discuss anything any more. I am fully resigned.
Wonder that I have even enough will power left to fight them off. Can‘t escape even
if I were willing to give up everything and run. They‘ll get me.
Had a letter from them yesterday—R.F.D. man brought it while I was at Brattleboro.
Typed and postmarked Bellows Falls. Tells what they want to do with me—I can‘t
repeat it. Look out for yourself, too! Smash that record. Cloudy nights keep up, and
moon waning all the time. Wish I dared to get help—it might brace up my will
power—but everyone who would dare to come at all would call me crazy unless
there happened to be some proof. Couldn‘t ask people to come for no reason at
all—am all out of touch with everybody and have been for years.
But I haven‘t told you the worst, Wilmarth. Brace up to read this, for it will give you
a shock. I am telling the truth, though. It is this—I have seen and touched one of
the things, or part of one of the things. God, man, but it‘s awful! It was dead, of
course. One of the dogs had it, and I found it near the kennel this morning. I tried to
save it in the woodshed to convince people of the whole thing, but it all evaporated
in a few hours. Nothing left. You know, all those things in the rivers were seen only
on the first morning after the flood. And here‘s the worst. I tried to photograph it for
you, but when I developed the film there wasn’t anything visible except the
woodshed. What can the thing have been made of? I saw it and felt it, and they all
leave footprints. It was surely made of matter—but what kind of matter? The shape
can‘t be described. It was a great crab with a lot of pyramided fleshy rings or knots
of thick, ropy stuff covered with feelers where a man‘s head would be. That green
sticky stuff is its blood or juice. And there are more of them due on earth any
minute.
Walter Brown is missing—hasn‘t been seen loafing around any of his usual corners
in the villages hereabouts. I must have got him with one of my shots, though the
creatures always seem to try to take their dead and wounded away.
Got into town this afternoon without any trouble, but am afraid they‘re beginning to
hold off because they‘re sure of me. Am writing this in Brattleboro P.O. This may be
goodbye—if it is, write my son George Goodenough Akeley, 176 Pleasant St., San
Diego, Cal., but don’t come up here. Write the boy if you don‘t hear from me in a
week, and watch the papers for news.
I‘m going to play my last two cards now—if I have the will power left. First to try
poison gas on the things (I‘ve got the right chemicals and have fixed up masks for
myself and the dogs) and then if that doesn‘t work, tell the sheriff. They can lock
me in a madhouse if they want to—it‘ll be better than what the other creatures
would do. Perhaps I can get them to pay attention to the prints around the house—
they are faint, but I can find them every morning. Suppose, though, police would
say I faked them somehow; for they all think I‘m a queer character.
Must try to have a state policeman spend a night here and see for himself—though
it would be just like the creatures to learn about it and hold off that night. They cut
my wires whenever I try to telephone in the night—the linemen think it is very
queer, and may testify for me if they don‘t go and imagine I cut them myself. I
haven‘t tried to keep them repaired for over a week now.
I could get some of the ignorant people to testify for me about the reality of the
horrors, but everybody laughs at what they say, and anyway, they have shunned
my place for so long that they don‘t know any of the new events. You couldn‘t get
one of those run-down farmers to come within a mile of my house for love or
money. The mail-carrier hears what they say and jokes me about it—God! If I only
dared tell him how real it is! I think I‘ll try to get him to notice the prints, but he
comes in the afternoon and they‘re usually about gone by that time. If I kept one by
setting a box or pan over it, he‘d think surely it was a fake or joke.
Wish I hadn‘t gotten to be such a hermit, so folks don‘t drop around as they used
to. I‘ve never dared shew the black stone or the kodak pictures, or play that record,
to anybody but the ignorant people. The others would say I faked the whole
business and do nothing but laugh. But I may yet try shewing the pictures. They
give those claw-prints clearly, even if the things that made them can‘t be
photographed. What a shame nobody else saw that thing this morning before it
went to nothing!
But I don‘t know as I care. After what I‘ve been through, a madhouse is as good a
place as any. The doctors can help me make up my mind to get away from this
house, and that is all that will save me.
Write my son George if you don‘t hear soon. Goodbye, smash that record, and
don‘t mix up in this.
Yrs—AKELEY
The letter frankly plunged me into the blackest of terror. I did not know what to say in answer,
but scratched off some incoherent words of advice and encouragement and sent them by
registered mail. I recall urging Akeley to move to Brattleboro at once, and place himself under
the protection of the authorities; adding that I would come to that town with the phonograph
record and help convince the courts of his sanity. It was time, too, I think I wrote, to alarm the
people generally against this thing in their midst. It will be observed that at this moment of
stress my own belief in all Akeley had told and claimed was virtually complete, though I did
think his failure to get a picture of the dead monster was due not to any freak of Nature but to
some excited slip of his own.
V.
Then, apparently crossing my incoherent note and reaching me Saturday afternoon,
September 8th, came that curiously different and calming letter neatly typed on a new
machine; that strange letter of reassurance and invitation which must have marked so
prodigious a transition in the whole nightmare drama of the lonely hills. Again I will quote from
memory—seeking for special reasons to preserve as much of the flavour of the style as I can.
It was postmarked Bellows Falls, and the signature as well as the body of the letter was
typed—as is frequent with beginners in typing. The text, though, was marvellously accurate
for a tyro‘s work; and I concluded that Akeley must have used a machine at some previous
period—perhaps in college. To say that the letter relieved me would be only fair, yet beneath
my relief lay a substratum of uneasiness. If Akeley had been sane in his terror, was he now
sane in his deliverance? And the sort of ―improved rapport‖ mentioned . . . what was it? The
entire thing implied such a diametrical reversal of Akeley‘s previous attitude! But here is the
substance of the text, carefully transcribed from a memory in which I take some pride.
Townshend, Vermont,
Thursday, Sept. 6, 1928.
My dear Wilmarth:—
It gives me great pleasure to be able to set you at rest regarding all the silly things
I‘ve been writing you. I say ―silly‖, although by that I mean my frightened attitude
rather than my descriptions of certain phenomena. Those phenomena are real and
important enough; my mistake had been in establishing an anomalous attitude
toward them.
I think I mentioned that my strange visitors were beginning to communicate with
me, and to attempt such communication. Last night this exchange of speech
became actual. In response to certain signals I admitted to the house a messenger
from those outside—a fellow-human, let me hasten to say. He told me much that
neither you nor I had even begun to guess, and shewed clearly how totally we had
misjudged and misinterpreted the purpose of the Outer Ones in maintaining their
secret colony on this planet.
It seems that the evil legends about what they have offered to men, and what they
wish in connexion with the earth, are wholly the result of an ignorant misconception
of allegorical speech—speech, of course, moulded by cultural backgrounds and
thought-habits vastly different from anything we dream of. My own conjectures, I
freely own, shot as widely past the mark as any of the guesses of illiterate farmers
and savage Indians. What I had thought morbid and shameful and ignominious is
in reality awesome and mind-expanding and even glorious—my previous estimate
being merely a phase of man‘s eternal tendency to hate and fear and shrink from
the utterly different.
Now I regret the harm I have inflicted upon these alien and incredible beings in the
course of our nightly skirmishes. If only I had consented to talk peacefully and
reasonably with them in the first place! But they bear me no grudge, their emotions
being organised very differently from ours. It is their misfortune to have had as their
human agents in Vermont some very inferior specimens—the late Walter Brown,
for example. He prejudiced me vastly against them. Actually, they have never
knowingly harmed men, but have often been cruelly wronged and spied upon by
our species. There is a whole secret cult of evil men (a man of your mystical
erudition will understand me when I link them with Hastur and the Yellow Sign)
devoted to the purpose of tracking them down and injuring them on behalf of
monstrous powers from other dimensions. It is against these aggressors—not
against normal humanity—that the drastic precautions of the Outer Ones are
directed. Incidentally, I learned that many of our lost letters were stolen not by the
Outer Ones but by the emissaries of this malign cult.
All that the Outer Ones wish of man is peace and non-molestation and an
increasing intellectual rapport. This latter is absolutely necessary now that our
inventions and devices are expanding our knowledge and motions, and making it
more and more impossible for the Outer Ones‘ necessary outposts to exist secretly
on this planet. The alien beings desire to know mankind more fully, and to have a
few of mankind‘s philosophic and scientific leaders know more about them. With
such an exchange of knowledge all perils will pass, and a satisfactory modus
vivendi be established. The very idea of any attempt to enslave or degrade
mankind is ridiculous.
As a beginning of this improved rapport, the Outer Ones have naturally chosen
me—whose knowledge of them is already so considerable—as their primary
interpreter on earth. Much was told me last night—facts of the most stupendous
and vista-opening nature—and more will be subsequently communicated to me
both orally and in writing. I shall not be called upon to make any trip outside just
yet, though I shall probably wish to do so later on—employing special means and
transcending everything which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as
human experience. My house will be besieged no longer. Everything has reverted
to normal, and the dogs will have no further occupation. In place of terror I have
been given a rich boon of knowledge and intellectual adventure which few other
mortals have ever shared.
The Outer Beings are perhaps the most marvellous organic things in or beyond all
space and time—members of a cosmos-wide race of which all other life-forms are
merely degenerate variants. They are more vegetable than animal, if these terms
can be applied to the sort of matter composing them, and have a somewhat
fungoid structure; though the presence of a chlorophyll-like substance and a very
singular nutritive system differentiate them altogether from true cormophytic fungi.
Indeed, the type is composed of a form of matter totally alien to our part of space—
with electrons having a wholly different vibration-rate. That is why the beings
cannot be photographed on the ordinary camera films and plates of our known
universe, even though our eyes can see them. With proper knowledge, however,
any good chemist could make a photographic emulsion which would record their
images.
The genus is unique in its ability to traverse the heatless and airless interstellar
void in full corporeal form, and some of its variants cannot do this without
mechanical aid or curious surgical transpositions. Only a few species have the
ether-resisting wings characteristic of the Vermont variety. Those inhabiting certain
remote peaks in the Old World were brought in other ways. Their external
resemblance to animal life, and to the sort of structure we understand as material,
is a matter of parallel evolution rather than of close kinship. Their brain-capacity
exceeds that of any other surviving life-form, although the winged types of our hill
country are by no means the most highly developed. Telepathy is their usual
means of discourse, though they have rudimentary vocal organs which, after a
slight operation (for surgery is an incredibly expert and every-day thing among
them), can roughly duplicate the speech of such types of organism as still use
speech.
Their main immediate abode is a still undiscovered and almost lightless planet at
the very edge of our solar system—beyond Neptune, and the ninth in distance from
the sun. It is, as we have inferred, the object mystically hinted at as ―Yuggoth‖ in
certain ancient and forbidden writings; and it will soon be the scene of a strange
focussing of thought upon our world in an effort to facilitate mental rapport. I would
not be surprised if astronomers became sufficiently sensitive to these thought-
currents to discover Yuggoth when the Outer Ones wish them to do so. But
Yuggoth, of course, is only the stepping-stone. The main body of the beings
inhabits strangely organised abysses wholly beyond the utmost reach of any
human imagination. The space-time globule which we recognise as the totality of
all cosmic entity is only an atom in the genuine infinity which is theirs. And as much
of this infinity as any human brain can hold is eventually to be opened up to me, as
it has been to not more than fifty other men since the human race has existed.
You will probably call this raving at first, Wilmarth, but in time you will appreciate
the titanic opportunity I have stumbled upon. I want you to share as much of it as is
possible, and to that end must tell you thousands of things that won‘t go on paper.
In the past I have warned you not to come to see me. Now that all is safe, I take
pleasure in rescinding that warning and inviting you.
Can‘t you make a trip up here before your college term opens? It would be
marvellously delightful if you could. Bring along the phonograph record and all my
letters to you as consultative data—we shall need them in piecing together the
whole tremendous story. You might bring the kodak prints, too, since I seem to
have mislaid the negatives and my own prints in all this recent excitement. But
what a wealth of facts I have to add to all this groping and tentative material—and
what a stupendous device I have to supplement my additions!
Don‘t hesitate—I am free from espionage now, and you will not meet anything
unnatural or disturbing. Just come along and let my car meet you at the Brattleboro
station—prepare to stay as long as you can, and expect many an evening of
discussion of things beyond all human conjecture. Don‘t tell anyone about it, of
course—for this matter must not get to the promiscuous public.
The train service to Brattleboro is not bad—you can get a time-table in Boston.
Take the B. & M. to Greenfield, and then change for the brief remainder of the way.
I suggest your taking the convenient 4:10 p.m.—standard—from Boston. This gets
into Greenfield at 7:35, and at 9:19 a train leaves there which reaches Brattleboro
at 10:01. That is week-days. Let me know the date and I‘ll have my car on hand at
the station.
Pardon this typed letter, but my handwriting has grown shaky of late, as you know,
and I don‘t feel equal to long stretches of script. I got this new Corona in
Brattleboro yesterday—it seems to work very well.
Awaiting word, and hoping to see you shortly with the phonograph record and all
my letters—and the kodak prints—
I am
Yours in anticipation,
HENRY W. AKELEY.
To Albert N. Wilmarth, Esq.,
Miskatonic University,
Arkham, Mass.
The complexity of my emotions upon reading, re-reading, and pondering over this strange
and unlooked-for letter is past adequate description. I have said that I was at once relieved
and made uneasy, but this expresses only crudely the overtones of diverse and largely
subconscious feelings which comprised both the relief and the uneasiness. To begin with, the
thing was so antipodally at variance with the whole chain of horrors preceding it—the change
of mood from stark terror to cool complacency and even exultation was so unheralded,
lightning-like, and complete! I could scarcely believe that a single day could so alter the
psychological perspective of one who had written that final frenzied bulletin of Wednesday, no
matter what relieving disclosures that day might have brought. At certain moments a sense of
conflicting unrealities made me wonder whether this whole distantly reported drama of
fantastic forces were not a kind of half-illusory dream created largely within my own mind.
Then I thought of the phonograph record and gave way to still greater bewilderment.
The letter seemed so unlike anything which could have been expected! As I analysed my
impression, I saw that it consisted of two distinct phases. First, granting that Akeley had been
sane before and was still sane, the indicated change in the situation itself was so swift and
unthinkable. And secondly, the change in Akeley‘s own manner, attitude, and language was
so vastly beyond the normal or the predictable. The man‘s whole personality seemed to have
undergone an insidious mutation—a mutation so deep that one could scarcely reconcile his
two aspects with the supposition that both represented equal sanity. Word-choice, spelling—
all were subtly different. And with my academic sensitiveness to prose style, I could trace
profound divergences in his commonest reactions and rhythm-responses. Certainly, the
emotional cataclysm or revelation which could produce so radical an overturn must be an
extreme one indeed! Yet in another way the letter seemed quite characteristic of Akeley. The
same old passion for infinity—the same old scholarly inquisitiveness. I could not a moment—
or more than a moment—credit the idea of spuriousness or malign substitution. Did not the
invitation—the willingness to have me test the truth of the letter in person—prove its
genuineness?
I did not retire Saturday night, but sat up thinking of the shadows and marvels behind the
letter I had received. My mind, aching from the quick succession of monstrous conceptions it
had been forced to confront during the last four months, worked upon this startling new
material in a cycle of doubt and acceptance which repeated most of the steps experienced in
facing the earlier wonders; till long before dawn a burning interest and curiosity had begun to
replace the original storm of perplexity and uneasiness. Mad or sane, metamorphosed or
merely relieved, the chances were that Akeley had actually encountered some stupendous
change of perspective in his hazardous research; some change at once diminishing his
danger—real or fancied—and opening dizzy new vistas of cosmic and superhuman
knowledge. My own zeal for the unknown flared up to meet his, and I felt myself touched by
the contagion of the morbid barrier-breaking. To shake off the maddening and wearying
limitations of time and space and natural law—to be linked with the vast outside—to come
close to the nighted and abysmal secrets of the infinite and the ultimate—surely such a thing
was worth the risk of one‘s life, soul, and sanity! And Akeley had said there was no longer any
peril—he had invited me to visit him instead of warning me away as before. I tingled at the
thought of what he might now have to tell me—there was an almost paralysing fascination in
the thought of sitting in that lonely and lately beleaguered farmhouse with a man who had
talked with actual emissaries from outer space; sitting there with the terrible record and the
pile of letters in which Akeley had summarised his earlier conclusions.
So late Sunday morning I telegraphed Akeley that I would meet him in Brattleboro on the
following Wednesday—September 12th—if that date were convenient for him. In only one
respect did I depart from his suggestions, and that concerned the choice of a train. Frankly, I
did not feel like arriving in that haunted Vermont region late at night; so instead of accepting
the train he chose I telephoned the station and devised another arrangement. By rising early
and taking the 8:07 a.m. (standard) into Boston, I could catch the 9:25 for Greenfield; arriving
there at 12:22 noon. This connected exactly with a train reaching Brattleboro at 1:08 p.m.—a
much more comfortable hour than 10:01 for meeting Akeley and riding with him into the close-
packed, secret-guarding hills.
I mentioned this choice in my telegram, and was glad to learn in the reply which came toward
evening that it had met with my prospective host‘s endorsement. His wire ran thus:
ARRANGEMENT SATISFACTORY. WILL MEET 1:08 TRAIN WEDNESDAY.
DON‘T FORGET RECORD AND LETTERS AND PRINTS. KEEP DESTINATION
QUIET. EXPECT GREAT REVELATIONS.
AKELEY.
Receipt of this message in direct response to one sent to Akeley—and necessarily delivered
to his house from the Townshend station either by official messenger or by a restored
telephone service—removed any lingering subconscious doubts I may have had about the
authorship of the perplexing letter. My relief was marked—indeed, it was greater than I could
account for at that time; since all such doubts had been rather deeply buried. But I slept
soundly and long that night, and was eagerly busy with preparations during the ensuing two
days.
VI.
On Wednesday I started as agreed, taking with me a valise full of simple necessities and
scientific data, including the hideous phonograph record, the kodak prints, and the entire file
of Akeley‘s correspondence. As requested, I had told no one where I was going; for I could
see that the matter demanded utmost privacy, even allowing for its most favourable turns. The
thought of actual mental contact with alien, outside entities was stupefying enough to my
trained and somewhat prepared mind; and this being so, what might one think of its effect on
the vast masses of uninformed laymen? I do not know whether dread or adventurous
expectancy was uppermost in me as I changed trains in Boston and began the long westward
run out of familiar regions into those I knew less thoroughly. Waltham—Concord—Ayer—
Fitchburg—Gardner—Athol—
My train reached Greenfield seven minutes late, but the northbound connecting express had
been held. Transferring in haste, I felt a curious breathlessness as the cars rumbled on
through the early afternoon sunlight into territories I had always read of but had never before
visited. I knew I was entering an altogether older-fashioned and more primitive New England
than the mechanised, urbanised coastal and southern areas where all my life had been spent;
an unspoiled, ancestral New England without the foreigners and factory-smoke, billboards
and concrete roads, of the sections which modernity has touched. There would be odd
survivals of that continuous native life whose deep roots make it the one authentic outgrowth
of the landscape—the continuous native life which keeps alive strange ancient memories, and
fertilises the soil for shadowy, marvellous, and seldom-mentioned beliefs.
Now and then I saw the blue Connecticut River gleaming in the sun, and after leaving
Northfield we crossed it. Ahead loomed green and cryptical hills, and when the conductor
came around I learned that I was at last in Vermont. He told me to set my watch back an hour,
since the northern hill country will have no dealings with new-fangled daylight time schemes.
As I did so it seemed to me that I was likewise turning the calendar back a century.
The train kept close to the river, and across in New Hampshire I could see the approaching
slope of steep Wantastiquet, about which singular old legends cluster. Then streets appeared
on my left, and a green island shewed in the stream on my right. People rose and filed to the
door, and I followed them. The car stopped, and I alighted beneath the long train-shed of the
Brattleboro station.
Looking over the line of waiting motors I hesitated a moment to see which one might turn out
to be the Akeley Ford, but my identity was divined before I could take the initiative. And yet it
was clearly not Akeley himself who advanced to meet me with an outstretched hand and a
mellowly phrased query as to whether I was indeed Mr. Albert N. Wilmarth of Arkham. This
man bore no resemblance to the bearded, grizzled Akeley of the snapshot; but was a younger
and more urban person, fashionably dressed, and wearing only a small, dark moustache. His
cultivated voice held an odd and almost disturbing hint of vague familiarity, though I could not
definitely place it in my memory.
As I surveyed him I heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospective host‘s who
had come down from Townshend in his stead. Akeley, he declared, had suffered a sudden
attack of some asthmatic trouble, and did not feel equal to making a trip in the outdoor air. It
was not serious, however, and there was to be no change in plans regarding my visit. I could
not make out just how much this Mr. Noyes—as he announced himself—knew of Akeley‘s
researches and discoveries, though it seemed to me that his casual manner stamped him as
a comparative outsider. Remembering what a hermit Akeley had been, I was a trifle surprised
at the ready availability of such a friend; but did not let my puzzlement deter me from entering
the motor to which he gestured me. It was not the small ancient car I had expected from
Akeley‘s descriptions, but a large and immaculate specimen of recent pattern—apparently
Noyes‘s own, and bearing Massachusetts licence plates with the amusing ―sacred codfish‖
device of that year. My guide, I concluded, must be a summer transient in the Townshend
region.
Noyes climbed into the car beside me and started it at once. I was glad that he did not
overflow with conversation, for some peculiar atmospheric tensity made me feel disinclined to
talk. The town seemed very attractive in the afternoon sunlight as we swept up an incline and
turned to the right into the main street. It drowsed like the older New England cities which one
remembers from boyhood, and something in the collocation of roofs and steeples and
chimneys and brick walls formed contours touching deep viol-strings of ancestral emotion. I
could tell that I was at the gateway of a region half-bewitched through the piling-up of
unbroken time-accumulations; a region where old, strange things have had a chance to grow
and linger because they have never been stirred up.
As we passed out of Brattleboro my sense of constraint and foreboding increased, for a
vague quality in the hill-crowded countryside with its towering, threatening, close-pressing
green and granite slopes hinted at obscure secrets and immemorial survivals which might or
might not be hostile to mankind. For a time our course followed a broad, shallow river which
flowed down from unknown hills in the north, and I shivered when my companion told me it
was the West River. It was in this stream, I recalled from newspaper items, that one of the
morbid crab-like beings had been seen floating after the floods.
Gradually the country around us grew wilder and more deserted. Archaic covered bridges
lingered fearsomely out of the past in pockets of the hills, and the half-abandoned railway
track paralleling the river seemed to exhale a nebulously visible air of desolation. There were
awesome sweeps of vivid valley where great cliffs rose, New England‘s virgin granite shewing
grey and austere through the verdure that scaled the crests. There were gorges where
untamed streams leaped, bearing down toward the river the unimagined secrets of a
thousand pathless peaks. Branching away now and then were narrow, half-concealed roads
that bored their way through solid, luxuriant masses of forest among whose primal trees
whole armies of elemental spirits might well lurk. As I saw these I thought of how Akeley had
been molested by unseen agencies on his drives along this very route, and did not wonder
that such things could be.
The quaint, sightly village of Newfane, reached in less than an hour, was our last link with that
world which man can definitely call his own by virtue of conquest and complete occupancy.
After that we cast off all allegiance to immediate, tangible, and time-touched things, and
entered a fantastic world of hushed unreality in which the narrow, ribbon-like road rose and
fell and curved with an almost sentient and purposeful caprice amidst the tenantless green
peaks and half-deserted valleys. Except for the sound of the motor, and the faint stir of the
few lonely farms we passed at infrequent intervals, the only thing that reached my ears was
the gurgling, insidious trickle of strange waters from numberless hidden fountains in the
shadowy woods.
The nearness and intimacy of the dwarfed, domed hills now became veritably breath-taking.
Their steepness and abruptness were even greater than I had imagined from hearsay, and
suggested nothing in common with the prosaic objective world we know. The dense, unvisited
woods on those inaccessible slopes seemed to harbour alien and incredible things, and I felt
that the very outline of the hills themselves held some strange and aeon-forgotten meaning,
as if they were vast hieroglyphs left by a rumoured titan race whose glories live only in rare,
deep dreams. All the legends of the past, and all the stupefying imputations of Henry Akeley‘s
letters and exhibits, welled up in my memory to heighten the atmosphere of tension and
growing menace. The purpose of my visit, and the frightful abnormalities it postulated, struck
me all at once with a chill sensation that nearly overbalanced my ardour for strange delvings.
My guide must have noticed my disturbed attitude; for as the road grew wilder and more
irregular, and our motion slower and more jolting, his occasional pleasant comments
expanded into a steadier flow of discourse. He spoke of the beauty and weirdness of the
country, and revealed some acquaintance with the folklore studies of my prospective host.
From his polite questions it was obvious that he knew I had come for a scientific purpose, and
that I was bringing data of some importance; but he gave no sign of appreciating the depth
and awfulness of the knowledge which Akeley had finally reached.
His manner was so cheerful, normal, and urbane that his remarks ought to have calmed and
reassured me; but oddly enough, I felt only the more disturbed as we bumped and veered
onward into the unknown wilderness of hills and woods. At times it seemed as if he were
pumping me to see what I knew of the monstrous secrets of the place, and with every fresh
utterance that vague, teasing, baffling familiarity in his voice increased. It was not an ordinary
or healthy familiarity despite the thoroughly wholesome and cultivated nature of the voice. I
somehow linked it with forgotten nightmares, and felt that I might go mad if I recognised it. If
any good excuse had existed, I think I would have turned back from my visit. As it was, I could
not well do so—and it occurred to me that a cool, scientific conversation with Akeley himself
after my arrival would help greatly to pull me together.
Besides, there was a strangely calming element of cosmic beauty in the hypnotic landscape
through which we climbed and plunged fantastically. Time had lost itself in the labyrinths
behind, and around us stretched only the flowering waves of faery and the recaptured
loveliness of vanished centuries—the hoary groves, the untainted pastures edged with gay
autumnal blossoms, and at vast intervals the small brown farmsteads nestling amidst huge
trees beneath vertical precipices of fragrant brier and meadow-grass. Even the sunlight
assumed a supernal glamour, as if some special atmosphere or exhalation mantled the whole
region. I had seen nothing like it before save in the magic vistas that sometimes form the
backgrounds of Italian primitives. Sodoma and Leonardo conceived such expanses, but only
in the distance, and through the vaultings of Renaissance arcades. We were now burrowing
bodily through the midst of the picture, and I seemed to find in its necromancy a thing I had
innately known or inherited, and for which I had always been vainly searching.
Suddenly, after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent, the car came to a
standstill. On my left, across a well-kept lawn which stretched to the road and flaunted a
border of whitewashed stones, rose a white, two-and-a-half-story house of unusual size and
elegance for the region, with a congeries of contiguous or arcade-linked barns, sheds, and
windmill behind and to the right. I recognised it at once from the snapshot I had received, and
was not surprised to see the name of Henry Akeley on the galvanised-iron mail-box near the
road. For some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and sparsely wooded
land extended, beyond which soared a steep, thickly forested hillside ending in a jagged leafy
crest. This latter, I knew, was the summit of Dark Mountain, half way up which we must have
climbed already.
Alighting from the car and taking my valise, Noyes asked me to wait while he went in and
notified Akeley of my advent. He himself, he added, had important business elsewhere, and
could not stop for more than a moment. As he briskly walked up the path to the house I
climbed out of the car myself, wishing to stretch my legs a little before settling down to a
sedentary conversation. My feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum
again now that I was on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly
in Akeley‘s letters, and I honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to link me with
such alien and forbidden worlds.
Close contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring, and it did not cheer
me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where those monstrous tracks and
that foetid green ichor had been found after moonless nights of fear and death. Idly I noticed
that none of Akeley‘s dogs seemed to be about. Had he sold them all as soon as the Outer
Ones made peace with him? Try as I might, I could not have the same confidence in the
depth and sincerity of that peace which appeared in Akeley‘s final and queerly different letter.
After all, he was a man of much simplicity and with little worldly experience. Was there not,
perhaps, some deep and sinister undercurrent beneath the surface of the new alliance?
Led by my thoughts, my eyes turned downward to the powdery road surface which had held
such hideous testimonies. The last few days had been dry, and tracks of all sorts cluttered the
rutted, irregular highway despite the unfrequented nature of the district. With a vague curiosity
I began to trace the outline of some of the heterogeneous impressions, trying meanwhile to
curb the flights of macabre fancy which the place and its memories suggested. There was
something menacing and uncomfortable in the funereal stillness, in the muffled, subtle trickle
of distant brooks, and in the crowding green peaks and black-wooded precipices that choked
the narrow horizon.
And then an image shot into my consciousness which made those vague menaces and flights
of fancy seem mild and insignificant indeed. I have said that I was scanning the
miscellaneous prints in the road with a kind of idle curiosity—but all at once that curiosity was
shockingly snuffed out by a sudden and paralysing gust of active terror. For though the dust
tracks were in general confused and overlapping, and unlikely to arrest any casual gaze, my
restless vision had caught certain details near the spot where the path to the house joined the
highway; and had recognised beyond doubt or hope the frightful significance of those details.
It was not for nothing, alas, that I had pored for hours over the kodak views of the Outer Ones‘
claw-prints which Akeley had sent. Too well did I know the marks of those loathsome nippers,
and that hint of ambiguous direction which stamped the horrors as no creatures of this planet.
No chance had been left me for merciful mistake. Here, indeed, in objective form before my
own eyes, and surely made not many hours ago, were at least three marks which stood out
blasphemously among the surprising plethora of blurred footprints leading to and from the
Akeley farmhouse. They were the hellish tracks of the living fungi from Yuggoth.
I pulled myself together in time to stifle a scream. After all, what more was there than I might
have expected, assuming that I had really believed Akeley‘s letters? He had spoken of
making peace with the things. Why, then, was it strange that some of them had visited his
house? But the terror was stronger than the reassurance. Could any man be expected to look
unmoved for the first time upon the claw-marks of animate beings from outer depths of
space? Just then I saw Noyes emerge from the door and approach with a brisk step. I must, I
reflected, keep command of myself, for the chances were this genial friend knew nothing of
Akeley‘s profoundest and most stupendous probings into the forbidden.
Akeley, Noyes hastened to inform me, was glad and ready to see me; although his sudden
attack of asthma would prevent him from being a very competent host for a day or two. These
spells hit him hard when they came, and were always accompanied by a debilitating fever and
general weakness. He never was good for much while they lasted—had to talk in a whisper,
and was very clumsy and feeble in getting about. His feet and ankles swelled, too, so that he
had to bandage them like a gouty old beef-eater. Today he was in rather bad shape, so that I
would have to attend very largely to my own needs; but he was none the less eager for
conversation. I would find him in the study at the left of the front hall—the room where the
blinds were shut. He had to keep the sunlight out when he was ill, for his eyes were very
sensitive.
As Noyes bade me adieu and rode off northward in his car I began to walk slowly toward the
house. The door had been left ajar for me; but before approaching and entering I cast a
searching glance around the whole place, trying to decide what had struck me as so
intangibly queer about it. The barns and sheds looked trimly prosaic enough, and I noticed
Akeley‘s battered Ford in its capacious, unguarded shelter. Then the secret of the queerness
reached me. It was the total silence. Ordinarily a farm is at least moderately murmurous from
its various kinds of livestock, but here all signs of life were missing. What of the hens and the
hogs? The cows, of which Akeley had said he possessed several, might conceivably be out to
pasture, and the dogs might possibly have been sold; but the absence of any trace of cackling
or grunting was truly singular.
I did not pause long on the path, but resolutely entered the open house door and closed it
behind me. It had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so, and now that I was shut
inside I had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat. Not that the place was in the least
sinister in visual suggestion; on the contrary, I thought the graceful late-colonial hallway very
tasteful and wholesome, and admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnished it.
What made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable. Perhaps it was a
certain odd odour which I thought I noticed—though I well knew how common musty odours
are in even the best of ancient farmhouses.
VII.
Refusing to let these cloudy qualms overmaster me, I recalled Noyes‘s instructions and
pushed open the six-panelled, brass-latched white door on my left. The room beyond was
darkened, as I had known before; and as I entered it I noticed that the queer odour was
stronger there. There likewise appeared to be some faint, half-imaginary rhythm or vibration in
the air. For a moment the closed blinds allowed me to see very little, but then a kind of
apologetic hacking or whispering sound drew my attention to a great easy-chair in the farther,
darker corner of the room. Within its shadowy depths I saw the white blur of a man‘s face and
hands; and in a moment I had crossed to greet the figure who had tried to speak. Dim though
the light was, I perceived that this was indeed my host. I had studied the kodak picture
repeatedly, and there could be no mistake about this firm, weather-beaten face with the
cropped, grizzled beard.
But as I looked again my recognition was mixed with sadness and anxiety; for certainly, this
face was that of a very sick man. I felt that there must be something more than asthma behind
that strained, rigid, immobile expression and unwinking glassy stare; and realised how terribly
the strain of his frightful experiences must have told on him. Was it not enough to break any
human being—even a younger man than this intrepid delver into the forbidden? The strange
and sudden relief, I feared, had come too late to save him from something like a general
breakdown. There was a touch of the pitiful in the limp, lifeless way his lean hands rested in
his lap. He had on a loose dressing-gown, and was swathed around the head and high
around the neck with a vivid yellow scarf or hood.
And then I saw that he was trying to talk in the same hacking whisper with which he had
greeted me. It was a hard whisper to catch at first, since the grey moustache concealed all
movements of the lips, and something in its timbre disturbed me greatly; but by concentrating
my attention I could soon make out its purport surprisingly well. The accent was by no means
a rustic one, and the language was even more polished than correspondence had led me to
expect.
―Mr. Wilmarth, I presume? You must pardon my not rising. I am quite ill, as Mr. Noyes must
have told you; but I could not resist having you come just the same. You know what I wrote in
my last letter—there is so much to tell you tomorrow when I shall feel better. I can‘t say how
glad I am to see you in person after all our many letters. You have the file with you, of course?
And the kodak prints and record? Noyes put your valise in the hall—I suppose you saw it. For
tonight I fear you‘ll have to wait on yourself to a great extent. Your room is upstairs—the one
over this—and you‘ll see the bathroom door open at the head of the staircase. There‘s a meal
spread for you in the dining-room—right through this door at your right—which you can take
whenever you feel like it. I‘ll be a better host tomorrow—but just now weakness leaves me
helpless.
―Make yourself at home—you might take out the letters and pictures and record and put them
on the table here before you go upstairs with your bag. It is here that we shall discuss them—
you can see my phonograph on that corner stand.
―No, thanks—there‘s nothing you can do for me. I know these spells of old. Just come back
for a little quiet visiting before night, and then go to bed when you please. I‘ll rest right here—
perhaps sleep here all night as I often do. In the morning I‘ll be far better able to go into the
things we must go into. You realise, of course, the utterly stupendous nature of the matter
before us. To us, as to only a few men on this earth, there will be opened up gulfs of time and
space and knowledge beyond anything within the conception of human science and
philosophy.
―Do you know that Einstein is wrong, and that certain objects and forces can move with a
velocity greater than that of light? With proper aid I expect to go backward and forward in
time, and actually see and feel the earth of remote past and future epochs. You can‘t imagine
the degree to which those beings have carried science. There is nothing they can‘t do with the
mind and body of living organisms. I expect to visit other planets, and even other stars and
galaxies. The first trip will be to Yuggoth, the nearest world fully peopled by the beings. It is a
strange dark orb at the very rim of our solar system—unknown to earthly astronomers as yet.
But I must have written you about this. At the proper time, you know, the beings there will
direct thought-currents toward us and cause it to be discovered—or perhaps let one of their
human allies give the scientists a hint.
―There are mighty cities on Yuggoth—great tiers of terraced towers built of black stone like the
specimen I tried to send you. That came from Yuggoth. The sun shines there no brighter than
a star, but the beings need no light. They have other, subtler senses, and put no windows in
their great houses and temples. Light even hurts and hampers and confuses them, for it does
not exist at all in the black cosmos outside time and space where they came from originally.
To visit Yuggoth would drive any weak man mad—yet I am going there. The black rivers of
pitch that flow under those mysterious Cyclopean bridges—things built by some elder race
extinct and forgotten before the things came to Yuggoth from the ultimate voids—ought to be
enough to make any man a Dante or Poe if he can keep sane long enough to tell what he has
seen.
―But remember—that dark world of fungoid gardens and windowless cities isn‘t really terrible.
It is only to us that it would seem so. Probably this world seemed just as terrible to the beings
when they first explored it in the primal age. You know they were here long before the
fabulous epoch of Cthulhu was over, and remember all about sunken R‘lyeh when it was
above the waters. They‘ve been inside the earth, too—there are openings which human
beings know nothing of—some of them in these very Vermont hills—and great worlds of
unknown life down there; blue-litten K‘n-yan, red-litten Yoth, and black, lightless N‘kai. It‘s
from N‘kai that frightful Tsathoggua came—you know, the amorphous, toad-like god-creature
mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon and the Commoriom myth-
cycle preserved by the Atlantean high-priest Klarkash-Ton.
―But we will talk of all this later on. It must be four or five o‘clock by this time. Better bring the
stuff from your bag, take a bite, and then come back for a comfortable chat.‖
Very slowly I turned and began to obey my host; fetching my valise, extracting and depositing
the desired articles, and finally ascending to the room designated as mine. With the memory
of that roadside claw-print fresh in my mind, Akeley‘s whispered paragraphs had affected me
queerly; and the hints of familiarity with this unknown world of fungous life—forbidden
Yuggoth—made my flesh creep more than I cared to own. I was tremendously sorry about
Akeley‘s illness, but had to confess that his hoarse whisper had a hateful as well as pitiful
quality. If only he wouldn‘t gloat so about Yuggoth and its black secrets!
My room proved a very pleasant and well-furnished one, devoid alike of the musty odour and
disturbing sense of vibration; and after leaving my valise there I descended again to greet
Akeley and take the lunch he had set out for me. The dining-room was just beyond the study,
and I saw that a kitchen ell extended still farther in the same direction. On the dining-table an
ample array of sandwiches, cake, and cheese awaited me, and a Thermos-bottle beside a
cup and saucer testified that hot coffee had not been forgotten. After a well-relished meal I
poured myself a liberal cup of coffee, but found that the culinary standard had suffered a
lapse in this one detail. My first spoonful revealed a faintly unpleasant acrid taste, so that I did
not take more. Throughout the lunch I thought of Akeley sitting silently in the great chair in the
darkened next room. Once I went in to beg him to share the repast, but he whispered that he
could eat nothing as yet. Later on, just before he slept, he would take some malted milk—all
he ought to have that day.
After lunch I insisted on clearing the dishes away and washing them in the kitchen sink—
incidentally emptying the coffee which I had not been able to appreciate. Then returning to the
darkened study I drew up a chair near my host‘s corner and prepared for such conversation
as he might feel inclined to conduct. The letters, pictures, and record were still on the large
centre-table, but for the nonce we did not have to draw upon them. Before long I forgot even
the bizarre odour and curious suggestions of vibration.
I have said that there were things in some of Akeley‘s letters—especially the second and most
voluminous one—which I would not dare to quote or even form into words on paper. This
hesitancy applies with still greater force to the things I heard whispered that evening in the
darkened room among the lonely haunted hills. Of the extent of the cosmic horrors unfolded
by that raucous voice I cannot even hint. He had known hideous things before, but what he
had learned since making his pact with the Outside Things was almost too much for sanity to
bear. Even now I absolutely refuse to believe what he implied about the constitution of
ultimate infinity, the juxtaposition of dimensions, and the frightful position of our known
cosmos of space and time in the unending chain of linked cosmos-atoms which makes up the
immediate super-cosmos of curves, angles, and material and semi-material electronic
organisation.
Never was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of basic entity—never was an
organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that transcends form and force and
symmetry. I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great temporary stars of
history had flared forth. I guessed—from hints which made even my informant pause timidly—
the secret behind the Magellanic Clouds and globular nebulae, and the black truth veiled by
the immemorial allegory of Tao. The nature of the Doels was plainly revealed, and I was told
the essence (though not the source) of the Hounds of Tindalos. The legend of Yig, Father of
Serpents, remained figurative no longer, and I started with loathing when told of the
monstrous nuclear chaos beyond angled space which the Necronomicon had mercifully
cloaked under the name of Azathoth. It was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret
myth cleared up in concrete terms whose stark, morbid hatefulness exceeded the boldest
hints of ancient and mediaeval mystics. Ineluctably I was led to believe that the first
whisperers of these accursed tales must have had discourse with Akeley‘s Outer Ones, and
perhaps have visited outer cosmic realms as Akeley now proposed visiting them.
I was told of the Black Stone and what it implied, and was glad that it had not reached me. My
guesses about those hieroglyphics had been all too correct! And yet Akeley now seemed
reconciled to the whole fiendish system he had stumbled upon; reconciled and eager to probe
farther into the monstrous abyss. I wondered what beings he had talked with since his last
letter to me, and whether many of them had been as human as that first emissary he had
mentioned. The tension in my head grew insufferable, and I built up all sorts of wild theories
about the queer, persistent odour and those insidious hints of vibration in the darkened room.
Night was falling now, and as I recalled what Akeley had written me about those earlier nights
I shuddered to think there would be no moon. Nor did I like the way the farmhouse nestled in
the lee of that colossal forested slope leading up to Dark Mountain‘s unvisited crest. With
Akeley‘s permission I lighted a small oil lamp, turned it low, and set it on a distant bookcase
beside the ghostly bust of Milton; but afterward I was sorry I had done so, for it made my
host‘s strained, immobile face and listless hands look damnably abnormal and corpse-like. He
seemed half-incapable of motion, though I saw him nod stiffly once in a while.
After what he had told, I could scarcely imagine what profounder secrets he was saving for
the morrow; but at last it developed that his trip to Yuggoth and beyond—and my own
possible participation in it—was to be the next day‘s topic. He must have been amused by the
start of horror I gave at hearing a cosmic voyage on my part proposed, for his head wabbled
violently when I shewed my fear. Subsequently he spoke very gently of how human beings
might accomplish—and several times had accomplished—the seemingly impossible flight
across the interstellar void. It seemed that complete human bodies did not indeed make the
trip, but that the prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill of the Outer
Ones had found a way to convey human brains without their concomitant physical structure.
There was a harmless way to extract a brain, and a way to keep the organic residue alive
during its absence. The bare, compact cerebral matter was then immersed in an occasionally
replenished fluid within an ether-tight cylinder of a metal mined in Yuggoth, certain electrodes
reaching through and connecting at will with elaborate instruments capable of duplicating the
three vital faculties of sight, hearing, and speech. For the winged fungus-beings to carry the
brain-cylinders intact through space was an easy matter. Then, on every planet covered by
their civilisation, they would find plenty of adjustable faculty-instruments capable of being
connected with the encased brains; so that after a little fitting these travelling intelligences
could be given a full sensory and articulate life—albeit a bodiless and mechanical one—at
each stage of their journeying through and beyond the space-time continuum. It was as
simple as carrying a phonograph record about and playing it wherever a phonograph of the
corresponding make exists. Of its success there could be no question. Akeley was not afraid.
Had it not been brilliantly accomplished again and again?
For the first time one of the inert, wasted hands raised itself and pointed to a high shelf on the
farther side of the room. There, in a neat row, stood more than a dozen cylinders of a metal I
had never seen before—cylinders about a foot high and somewhat less in diameter, with
three curious sockets set in an isosceles triangle over the front convex surface of each. One
of them was linked at two of the sockets to a pair of singular-looking machines that stood in
the background. Of their purport I did not need to be told, and I shivered as with ague. Then I
saw the hand point to a much nearer corner where some intricate instruments with attached
cords and plugs, several of them much like the two devices on the shelf behind the cylinders,
were huddled together.
―There are four kinds of instruments here, Wilmarth,‖ whispered the voice. ―Four kinds—three
faculties each—makes twelve pieces in all. You see there are four different sorts of beings
presented in those cylinders up there. Three humans, six fungoid beings who can‘t navigate
space corporeally, two beings from Neptune (God! if you could see the body this type has on
its own planet!), and the rest entities from the central caverns of an especially interesting dark
star beyond the galaxy. In the principal outpost inside Round Hill you‘ll now and then find
more cylinders and machines—cylinders of extra-cosmic brains with different senses from
any we know—allies and explorers from the uttermost Outside—and special machines for
giving them impressions and expression in the several ways suited at once to them and to the
comprehensions of different types of listeners. Round Hill, like most of the beings‘ main
outposts all through the various universes, is a very cosmopolitan place! Of course, only the
more common types have been lent to me for experiment.
―Here—take the three machines I point to and set them on the table. That tall one with the two
glass lenses in front—then the box with the vacuum tubes and sounding-board—and now the
one with the metal disc on top. Now for the cylinder with the label ‗B-67‘ pasted on it. Just
stand in that Windsor chair to reach the shelf. Heavy? Never mind! Be sure of the number—
B-67. Don‘t bother that fresh, shiny cylinder joined to the two testing instruments—the one
with my name on it. Set B-67 on the table near where you‘ve put the machines—and see that
the dial switch on all three machines is jammed over to the extreme left.
―Now connect the cord of the lens machine with the upper socket on the cylinder—there! Join
the tube machine to the lower left-hand socket, and the disc apparatus to the outer socket.
Now move all the dial switches on the machines over to the extreme right—first the lens one,
then the disc one, and then the tube one. That‘s right. I might as well tell you that this is a
human being—just like any of us. I‘ll give you a taste of some of the others tomorrow.‖
To this day I do not know why I obeyed those whispers so slavishly, or whether I thought
Akeley was mad or sane. After what had gone before, I ought to have been prepared for
anything; but this mechanical mummery seemed so like the typical vagaries of crazed
inventors and scientists that it struck a chord of doubt which even the preceding discourse
had not excited. What the whisperer implied was beyond all human belief—yet were not the
other things still farther beyond, and less preposterous only because of their remoteness from
tangible concrete proof?
As my mind reeled amidst this chaos, I became conscious of a mixed grating and whirring
from all three machines lately linked to the cylinder—a grating and whirring which soon
subsided into a virtual noiselessness. What was about to happen? Was I to hear a voice? And
if so, what proof would I have that it was not some cleverly concocted radio device talked into
by a concealed but closely watching speaker? Even now I am unwilling to swear just what I
heard, or just what phenomenon really took place before me. But something certainly seemed
to take place.
To be brief and plain, the machine with the tubes and sound-box began to speak, and with a
point and intelligence which left no doubt that the speaker was actually present and observing
us. The voice was loud, metallic, lifeless, and plainly mechanical in every detail of its
production. It was incapable of inflection or expressiveness, but scraped and rattled on with a
deadly precision and deliberation.
―Mr. Wilmarth,‖ it said, ―I hope I do not startle you. I am a human being like yourself, though
my body is now resting safely under proper vitalising treatment inside Round Hill, about a mile
and a half east of here. I myself am here with you—my brain is in that cylinder and I see,
hear, and speak through these electronic vibrators. In a week I am going across the void as I
have been many times before, and I expect to have the pleasure of Mr. Akeley‘s company. I
wish I might have yours as well; for I know you by sight and reputation, and have kept close
track of your correspondence with our friend. I am, of course, one of the men who have
become allied with the outside beings visiting our planet. I met them first in the Himalayas,
and have helped them in various ways. In return they have given me experiences such as few
men have ever had.
―Do you realise what it means when I say I have been on thirty-seven different celestial
bodies—planets, dark stars, and less definable objects—including eight outside our galaxy
and two outside the curved cosmos of space and time? All this has not harmed me in the
least. My brain has been removed from my body by fissions so adroit that it would be crude to
call the operation surgery. The visiting beings have methods which make these extractions
easy and almost normal—and one‘s body never ages when the brain is out of it. The brain, I
may add, is virtually immortal with its mechanical faculties and a limited nourishment supplied
by occasional changes of the preserving fluid.
―Altogether, I hope most heartily that you will decide to come with Mr. Akeley and me. The
visitors are eager to know men of knowledge like yourself, and to shew them the great
abysses that most of us have had to dream about in fanciful ignorance. It may seem strange
at first to meet them, but I know you will be above minding that. I think Mr. Noyes will go
along, too—the man who doubtless brought you up here in his car. He has been one of us for
years—I suppose you recognised his voice as one of those on the record Mr. Akeley sent
you.‖
At my violent start the speaker paused a moment before concluding.
―So, Mr. Wilmarth, I will leave the matter to you; merely adding that a man with your love of
strangeness and folklore ought never to miss such a chance as this. There is nothing to fear.
All transitions are painless, and there is much to enjoy in a wholly mechanised state of
sensation. When the electrodes are disconnected, one merely drops off into a sleep of
especially vivid and fantastic dreams.
―And now, if you don‘t mind, we might adjourn our session till tomorrow. Good night—just turn
all the switches back to the left; never mind the exact order, though you might let the lens
machine be last. Good night, Mr. Akeley—treat our guest well! Ready now with those
switches?‖
That was all. I obeyed mechanically and shut off all three switches, though dazed with doubt
of everything that had occurred. My head was still reeling as I heard Akeley‘s whispering
voice telling me that I might leave all the apparatus on the table just as it was. He did not
essay any comment on what had happened, and indeed no comment could have conveyed
much to my burdened faculties. I heard him telling me I could take the lamp to use in my
room, and deduced that he wished to rest alone in the dark. It was surely time he rested, for
his discourse of the afternoon and evening had been such as to exhaust even a vigorous
man. Still dazed, I bade my host good night and went upstairs with the lamp, although I had
an excellent pocket flashlight with me.
I was glad to be out of that downstairs study with the queer odour and vague suggestions of
vibration, yet could not of course escape a hideous sense of dread and peril and cosmic
abnormality as I thought of the place I was in and the forces I was meeting. The wild, lonely
region, the black, mysteriously forested slope towering so close behind the house, the
footprints in the road, the sick, motionless whisperer in the dark, the hellish cylinders and
machines, and above all the invitations to strange surgery and stranger voyagings—these
things, all so new and in such sudden succession, rushed in on me with a cumulative force
which sapped my will and almost undermined my physical strength.
To discover that my guide Noyes was the human celebrant in that monstrous bygone Sabbat-
ritual on the phonograph record was a particular shock, though I had previously sensed a dim,
repellent familiarity in his voice. Another special shock came from my own attitude toward my
host whenever I paused to analyse it; for much as I had instinctively liked Akeley as revealed
in his correspondence, I now found that he filled me with a distinct repulsion. His illness ought
to have excited my pity; but instead, it gave me a kind of shudder. He was so rigid and inert
and corpse-like—and that incessant whispering was so hateful and unhuman!
It occurred to me that this whispering was different from anything else of the kind I had ever
heard; that, despite the curious motionlessness of the speaker‘s moustache-screened lips, it
had a latent strength and carrying-power remarkable for the wheezings of an asthmatic. I had
been able to understand the speaker when wholly across the room, and once or twice it had
seemed to me that the faint but penetrant sounds represented not so much weakness as
deliberate repression—for what reason I could not guess. From the first I had felt a disturbing
quality in their timbre. Now, when I tried to weigh the matter, I thought I could trace this
impression to a kind of subconscious familiarity like that which had made Noyes‘s voice so
hazily ominous. But when or where I had encountered the thing it hinted at, was more than I
could tell.
One thing was certain—I would not spend another night here. My scientific zeal had vanished
amidst fear and loathing, and I felt nothing now but a wish to escape from this net of morbidity
and unnatural revelation. I knew enough now. It must indeed be true that cosmic linkages do
exist—but such things are surely not meant for normal human beings to meddle with.
Blasphemous influences seemed to surround me and press chokingly upon my senses.
Sleep, I decided, would be out of the question; so I merely extinguished the lamp and threw
myself on the bed fully dressed. No doubt it was absurd, but I kept ready for some unknown
emergency; gripping in my right hand the revolver I had brought along, and holding the pocket
flashlight in my left. Not a sound came from below, and I could imagine how my host was
sitting there with cadaverous stiffness in the dark.
Somewhere I heard a clock ticking, and was vaguely grateful for the normality of the sound. It
reminded me, though, of another thing about the region which disturbed me—the total
absence of animal life. There were certainly no farm beasts about, and now I realised that
even the accustomed night-noises of wild living things were absent. Except for the sinister
trickle of distant unseen waters, that stillness was anomalous—interplanetary—and I
wondered what star-spawned, intangible blight could be hanging over the region. I recalled
from old legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the Outer Ones, and thought
of what those tracks in the road might mean.
VIII.
Do not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted, or how much of what
ensued was sheer dream. If I tell you that I awaked at a certain time, and heard and saw
certain things, you will merely answer that I did not wake then; and that everything was a
dream until the moment when I rushed out of the house, stumbled to the shed where I had
seen the old Ford, and seized that ancient vehicle for a mad, aimless race over the haunted
hills which at last landed me—after hours of jolting and winding through forest-threatened
labyrinths—in a village which turned out to be Townshend.
You will also, of course, discount everything else in my report; and declare that all the
pictures, record-sounds, cylinder-and-machine sounds, and kindred evidences were bits of
pure deception practiced on me by the missing Henry Akeley. You will even hint that he
conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a silly and elaborate hoax—that he had the
express shipment removed at Keene, and that he had Noyes make that terrifying wax record.
It is odd, though, that Noyes has not even yet been identified; that he was unknown at any of
the villages near Akeley‘s place, though he must have been frequently in the region. I wish I
had stopped to memorise the licence-number of his car—or perhaps it is better after all that I
did not. For I, despite all you can say, and despite all I sometimes try to say to myself, know
that loathsome outside influences must be lurking there in the half-unknown hills—and that
those influences have spies and emissaries in the world of men. To keep as far as possible
from such influences and such emissaries is all that I ask of life in future.
When my frantic story sent a sheriff‘s posse out to the farmhouse, Akeley was gone without
leaving a trace. His loose dressing-gown, yellow scarf, and foot-bandages lay on the study
floor near his corner easy-chair, and it could not be decided whether any of his other apparel
had vanished with him. The dogs and livestock were indeed missing, and there were some
curious bullet-holes both on the house‘s exterior and on some of the walls within; but beyond
this nothing unusual could be detected. No cylinders or machines, none of the evidences I
had brought in my valise, no queer odour or vibration-sense, no footprints in the road, and
none of the problematical things I glimpsed at the very last.
I stayed a week in Brattleboro after my escape, making inquiries among people of every kind
who had known Akeley; and the results convince me that the matter is no figment of dream or
delusion. Akeley‘s queer purchases of dogs and ammunition and chemicals, and the cutting of
his telephone wires, are matters of record; while all who knew him—including his son in
California—concede that his occasional remarks on strange studies had a certain
consistency. Solid citizens believe he was mad, and unhesitatingly pronounce all reported
evidences mere hoaxes devised with insane cunning and perhaps abetted by eccentric
associates; but the lowlier country folk sustain his statements in every detail. He had shewed
some of these rustics his photographs and black stone, and had played the hideous record for
them; and they all said the footprints and buzzing voice were like those described in ancestral
legends.
They said, too, that suspicious sights and sounds had been noticed increasingly around
Akeley‘s house after he found the black stone, and that the place was now avoided by
everybody except the mail man and other casual, tough-minded people. Dark Mountain and
Round Hill were both notoriously haunted spots, and I could find no one who had ever closely
explored either. Occasional disappearances of natives throughout the district‘s history were
well attested, and these now included the semi-vagabond Walter Brown, whom Akeley‘s
letters had mentioned. I even came upon one farmer who thought he had personally glimpsed
one of the queer bodies at flood-time in the swollen West River, but his tale was too confused
to be really valuable.
When I left Brattleboro I resolved never to go back to Vermont, and I feel quite certain I shall
keep my resolution. Those wild hills are surely the outpost of a frightful cosmic race—as I
doubt all the less since reading that a new ninth planet has been glimpsed beyond Neptune,
just as those influences had said it would be glimpsed. Astronomers, with a hideous
appropriateness they little suspect, have named this thing ―Pluto‖. I feel, beyond question, that
it is nothing less than nighted Yuggoth—and I shiver when I try to figure out the real reason
why its monstrous denizens wish it to be known in this way at this especial time. I vainly try to
assure myself that these daemoniac creatures are not gradually leading up to some new
policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitants.
But I have still to tell of the ending of that terrible night in the farmhouse. As I have said, I did
finally drop into a troubled doze; a doze filled with bits of dream which involved monstrous
landscape-glimpses. Just what awaked me I cannot yet say, but that I did indeed awake at
this given point I feel very certain. My first confused impression was of stealthily creaking
floor-boards in the hall outside my door, and of a clumsy, muffled fumbling at the latch. This,
however, ceased almost at once; so that my really clear impressions began with the voices
heard from the study below. There seemed to be several speakers, and I judged that they
were controversially engaged.
By the time I had listened a few seconds I was broad awake, for the nature of the voices was
such as to make all thought of sleep ridiculous. The tones were curiously varied, and no one
who had listened to that accursed phonograph record could harbour any doubts about the
nature of at least two of them. Hideous though the idea was, I knew that I was under the
same roof with nameless things from abysmal space; for those two voices were unmistakably
the blasphemous buzzings which the Outside Beings used in their communication with men.
The two were individually different—different in pitch, accent, and tempo—but they were both
of the same damnable general kind.
A third voice was indubitably that of a mechanical utterance-machine connected with one of
the detached brains in the cylinders. There was as little doubt about that as about the
buzzings; for the loud, metallic, lifeless voice of the previous evening, with its inflectionless,
expressionless scraping and rattling, and its impersonal precision and deliberation, had been
utterly unforgettable. For a time I did not pause to question whether the intelligence behind
the scraping was the identical one which had formerly talked to me; but shortly afterward I
reflected that any brain would emit vocal sounds of the same quality if linked to the same
mechanical speech-producer; the only possible differences being in language, rhythm, speed,
and pronunciation. To complete the eldritch colloquy there were two actually human voices—
one the crude speech of an unknown and evidently rustic man, and the other the suave
Bostonian tones of my erstwhile guide Noyes.
As I tried to catch the words which the stoutly fashioned floor so bafflingly intercepted, I was
also conscious of a great deal of stirring and scratching and shuffling in the room below; so
– Até onde me lembro, você nunca quis roubar a cena.
Ele sorriu, expondo seus dentes esculpidos, de contornos
eficientes, uma fantasia de um dentista
de vanguarda sobre como os dentes poderiam ser em
espécies mais rápidas e elegantes.
– Danielle Stark vai voar conosco. – Ela ouviu o som de
um helicóptero se aproximando. – Ela
vai nos encontrar no aeroporto de Los Angeles.
– Nós a estrangularemos – disse ele, em seu tom
confidencial, enquanto a ajudava com o casaco
azul que Kelly havia escolhido para ela. – Se
prometermos deixar vazar que o motivo foi sexual, ela
pode até resolver participar da brincadeira...
– Você é horrível.
– Danielle é um horror, fofa.
– Olha quem está falando.
– Ah – disse o cabeleireiro, aguçando os olhos, – mas
minha alma é pura como a de uma criança.
O helicóptero estava pousando.
***Danielle Stark, conhecida pelas versões stim da Vogue-
Nippon e da Vogue-Europa estaria, segundo rumores,
quase com noventa anos. Se isso fosse verdade, Angie
pensou, inspecionando discretamente a figura da
jornalista enquanto os três embarcavam no Lear, Danielle
e Porphyre estariam no mesmo nível no que diz respeito
às modificações cirúrgicas totais. Aparentemente em
seus trinta anos, o único detalhe que poderia denunciar
sua idade era um par de implantes de lentes Carl Zeiss
azul-claro. Uma jovem repórter de moda francesa uma
vez referiu-se aos implantes como
“estilosamente antigos”; a repórter, diz a lenda da Net,
nunca mais voltou a trabalhar.
E logo, Angie sabia, Danielle iria querer falar sobre
drogas, drogas de celebridades, os olhos
de uma estudante bem abertos para anotar tudo.
***
Sob o olhar assustador de Porphyre, Danielle deu um
jeito de se conter até que estivessem em
velocidade de cruzeiro sobre Utah.
– Eu gostaria – começou – de não ser eu a pessoa a
trazer isso à tona.
– Danielle – Angie retrucou –, sinto muito. Que falta de
tato. – Ela apertou a superfície envernizada da cozinha
de bordo Hosaka, que zuniu suavemente e começou a
distribuir pratos minúsculos de pato defumado em chá,
ostras do golfo em torradas de pimenta negra, pudim de
lagostins,
panquecas
de
gergelim...
Porphyre,
compreendendo a jogada de Angie, trouxe uma garrafade Chablis resfriado – o favorito de Danielle, Angie
lembrou-se. Alguém ... Swift? ... também havia se
lembrado.
– Drogas – disse Danielle, quinze minutos depois,
terminando o último pedaço do pato.
– Não se preocupe – assegurou Porphyre. – Quando
chegarmos a Nova York, eles têm o que você quiser.
Danielle sorriu. – Você é tão divertido. Sabia que eu
tenho uma cópia da sua certidão de nascimento? Eu sei o
seu nome verdadeiro. – Ela lhe dirigiu um olhar
fulminante, ainda sorrindo.
– ...paus e pedras... – disse ele, enchendo o copo dela.
– Um comentário interessante no que diz respeito a
defeitos congênitos. – Ela tomou um gole de
vinho.
– Congênito, genital... Nós todos mudamos tanto por
estes dias, não é? Quem anda arrumando
seu cabelo, querida? – Ele se aproximou dela e inclinou-
se. – O que te salva, Danielle, é que você faz o resto de
sua espécie parecer vagamente humana.
Danielle sorriu.
***
A entrevista em si correu tranquila o bastante. Danielle
era demasiado habilidosa como entrevistadora para
permitir que seus ataques dissimulados cruzassem o
limite da dor, onde eles poderiam encontrar sériaresistência. Mas quando ela passou a ponta do dedo
atrás da têmpora, pressionando um interruptor
subcutâneo que desativava seu equipamento de
gravação, Angie temeu o
verdadeiro ataque.
– Obrigada – disse Danielle. – O resto do voo ficará em
off, é claro.
– Por que você não pega uma ou duas garrafas e entorna
tudo? – perguntou Porphyre.
– O que eu não consigo entender, querida – disse
Danielle, ignorando-o –, é por que você se deu
ao trabalho...
– Por que eu me dei ao trabalho, Danielle?
– De ir até aquela clínica entediante. Você disse que não
afetava seu trabalho. Você também disse que não ficava
“alta”, não no sentido habitual. – Deu uma risadinha. –
Contudo você afirma que era uma substância
terrivelmente viciante. Por que você decidiu parar?
– Era terrivelmente caro...
– Em seu caso, certamente, é uma questão retórica.
Verdade, pensou Angie, embora uma semana daquilo
custasse o mesmo que você ganha em um ano.
– Suponho que eu comecei a me ressentir por pagar para
me sentir normal. Ou uma
aproximação modesta do que seja normal.– Você criou uma tolerância?
– Não.
– Que estranho.
– Na verdade, não. Esses designers criam substâncias
que supostamente superam as
desvantagens tradicionais.
– Ah. Mas e quanto às novas desvantagens,
desvantagens atuais? – Danielle se serviu de um
as
pouco mais de vinho. – Eu ouvi uma versão diferente
disso tudo, é claro.
– Ouviu?
– Claro que sim. O que era, quem fez, por que você
parou.
– Sim?
– Era um antipsicótico, produzido pelos
laboratórios da Sense/Net. Você parou porque
próprios
preferia continuar louca.
Porphyre gentilmente tirou o copo da mão de Danielle
enquanto suas pálpebras caíam
pesadamente sobre os brilhantes olhos azuis. – Boa
noite, querida – disse ele. Os olhos de Danielle se
fecharam e ela começou a roncar baixinho.
– Porphyre, o quê...?– Eu coloquei uma dose no vinho dela – disse ele. – Ela
não saberá a diferença, fofa. Ela não se
lembrará de nada que não gravou... Ele deu um largo
sorriso. – Você não queria ter de ouvir esta cachorra
durante toda a viagem de volta, queria?
– Mas ela vai descobrir, Porphyre!
– Não, não vai. Vamos dizer a ela que acabou com três
garrafas sozinha e fez uma bagunça nojenta no banheiro.
É exatamente como ela vai se sentir, de qualquer forma.
– Ele deu uma risadinha.
***
Danielle Stark ainda estava roncando, bastante alto
agora, em uma das camas embutidas nos fundos da
cabine.
– Porphyre – disse Angie –, você acha que ela poderia
estar certa?
O cabeleireiro encarou-a com seus olhos lindos, não
humanos. – E você não teria descoberto?
– Eu não sei...
Ele suspirou. – Minha fofa se preocupa demais. Você está
livre agora. Aproveite.
– Eu realmente ouço vozes, Porphyre.
– E nós também não ouvimos, fofa?
– Não – disse ela –, não como as minhas. Você sabe
alguma coisa sobre religiões africanas, Porphyre?Ele deu um sorriso forçado. – Eu não sou africano.
– Mas quando você era criança...
– Quando eu era criança – disse Porphyre –, eu era
branco.
– Oh...
Ele riu.
– Religiões, fofa?
– Antes de eu chegar à Net, eu tinha amigos. Em Nova
Jersey. Eles eram negros e... religiosos.
Ele deu um sorriso falso e revirou os olhos. – Símbolos de
vodu, fofa? Ossos de galinha e óleo
de menta?
– Você sabe que não é assim.
– E se eu souber?
– Não brinque comigo, Porphyre. Eu preciso de você.
– Fofa, você me tem. E sim, eu sei o que você quer dizer.
E essas são as suas vozes?
– Elas eram. Depois que comecei a usar o pó, elas se
foram...
– E agora?
– Sumiram. – Mas o impulso fazia parte do passado
agora, e ela se conteve para não lhe contarsobre Grande Brigitte e a droga no casaco.
– Bom – disse ele. – Isso é bom, fofa.

O Lear começou sua descida sobre Ohio. Porphyre estava
encarando a divisória da cabine, imóvel como uma
estátua. Angie olhou para o país de nuvens abaixo,
enquanto crescia na direção deles, lembrando o jogo com
que se distraía nos aviões quando pequena, enviando
uma Angie imaginária para fora dos canyons cheios de
nuvens e sobre os picos fofos que se tornavam
magicamente sólidos. Aqueles aviões eram da Maas-
Neotek, ela supôs. Dos jatos corporativos da Maas ela
havia ido para os Lears da Net. Ela conhecia linhas
aéreas comerciais somente das locações dos seus stims:
de Nova York para Paris no voo inaugural do Concorde
restaurado da JAL, com Robin e um grupo exclusivo de
pessoas da Net.
Aterrissando. Eles já estavam sobre Nova Jersey? As
crianças que brincavam nos playgrounds
dos tetos da arcologia de Beauvoir ouviam o motor do
Lear? Por acaso o som de sua passagem iria
varrer gentilmente os condomínios da infância de Bobby?
Quão impensavelmente intrincado era o mundo, em seu
emaranhado de mecanismos, quando o desejo
corporativo da Sense/Net sacudia pequenos ossos nos
ouvidos de crianças desconhecidas e desconhecedoras...
– Porphyre sabe de algumas coisas – disse ele, muito
suavemente. – Mas Porphyre precisa de tempo para
pensar, fofa...O avião fez uma curva para a aproximação final.

KUROMAKU
E Sally permaneceu em silêncio, na rua e no táxi, durante
todo o longo caminho gelado de volta
para o hotel.
Sally e Swain estavam sendo chantageados por uma
inimiga de Sally “lá em cima, no poço”.
Sally estava sendo forçada a sequestrar Angie Mitchell. O
pensamento de que alguém fizesse isso com a estrela da
Sense/Net parecia singularmente irreal para Kumiko,
como se alguém estivesse planejando o assassinato de
um ser mítico.
O Finlandês tinha dado a entender que a própria Angie
estava envolvida, de algum modo misterioso, mas ele
tinha usado palavras e expressões que Kumiko não havia
entendido. Alguma coisa no ciberespaço; pessoas
formando pactos com uma ou mais coisas por lá. O Fin
tinha conhecido um rapaz que fora amante de Angie –
mas o amante dela não era Robin Lanier? A mãe de
Kumiko tinha permitido que ela rodasse vários stims de
Angie e Robin. Este outro rapaz tinha sido um cowboy,
um ladrão de dados, como Tick em Londres...
E quanto à inimiga, a chantagista? Ela estava louca,
disse Fin, e sua loucura havia trazido o declínio da
fortuna de sua família. Ela vivia sozinha, em sua casa
ancestral, a casa chamada Straylight. O que Sally tinha
feito para merecer sua inimizade? Ela tinha realmentematado o pai dessa mulher? E quem eram os outros, os
outros que estavam mortos? Já tinha escutado seus
nomes
gaijin.
E Sally tinha conseguido descobrir o que queria saber, na
visita ao Fin? Kumiko tinha esperado,
no final, que houvesse algum pronunciamento do
santuário blindado, mas a troca não tinha levado a nada,
a não ser a um ritual gaijin de despedidas brincalhonas.
***
No vestíbulo do hotel, Petal estava esperando numa
poltrona de veludo azul. Vestido para viagem, seu corpo
envolto num terno de lã cinza, levantou-se da poltrona
como se fosse um estranho balão quando elas entraram,
o olhar suave, como sempre, atrás dos óculos de
armação de aço.
– Olá – disse ele, e tossiu. – Swain mandou que eu viesse
atrás de vocês. Só para cuidar da garota, entende.
– Leve-a de volta – disse Sally. – Agora. Hoje à noite.
– Sally! Não! – Mas a mão de Sally já tinha agarrado
firmemente o braço de Kumiko, levando-a
em direção à entrada do lounge escuro, fora do vestíbulo.
– Espere aqui – Sally ordenou para Petal. – Ouça-me –
disse ela, puxando Kumiko num canto,
para a sombra. – Você vai voltar. Eu não posso mantê-la
aqui, agora.– Mas eu não gosto de lá. Não gosto de Swain nem da
casa dele... Eu...
– Petal é gente fina – disse Sally, aproximando-se e
falando rapidamente. – Eu diria para confiar nele. Swain,
bem, você sabe o que Swain é, mas ele está nas mãos do
seu pai. Aconteça o que acontecer, acho que eles irão
mantê-la fora do caminho. Mas se as coisas ficarem
ruins, realmente ruins, vá ao pub onde nos encontramos
com o Tick. The Rose and Crown, você se lembra?
Kumiko concordou com a cabeça, olhos enchendo-se de
lágrimas.
– E se Tick não estiver lá, procure um barman chamado
Bevan e mencione o meu nome.
– Sally, eu...
– Você está bem – disse Sally, e beijou-a abruptamente,
uma de suas lentes tocando por um instante a bochecha
de Kumiko, assustadoramente fria e inflexível. – Eu,
querida, já fui.
E ela se foi, no zunido emudecido do vestíbulo, e Petal
limpou a garganta na entrada.
***
O voo de volta a Londres foi como uma longa viagem de
metrô. Petal passou o tempo escrevendo palavras, uma
letra de cada vez, em algum quebra-cabeças idiota de
um fax inglês, resmungando baixinho consigo mesmo.
Finalmente ela dormiu e sonhou com sua mãe...
***– O aquecedor está funcionando – disse Petal, saindo de
Heathrow em direção à casa de Swain.
Estava desconfortavelmente quente no Jaguar, um calor
seco que cheirava a couro e fazia as narinas arderem. Ela
o ignorou, encarando a luz pálida da manhã, os telhados
brilhando negros através da neve derretida, fileiras de
chaminés...
– Ele não está zangado com você, sabe – disse Petal. –
Ele sente uma responsabilidade especial...
– Giri.
– Humm... sim. Responsável, entende. Sally nunca foi o
que se pode chamar de previsível, realmente, mas nós
não esperávamos...
– Eu não quero conversar, obrigada.
Os pequenos olhos dele, preocupados, no espelho.
***
A alameda estava alinhada com carros estacionados,
longos carros prateados com vidros
escuros.
– Estamos recebendo muitas visitas nesta semana – disse
Petal, estacionando do outro lado da rua, em frente ao
número 17. Saiu do carro e abriu a porta para ela. Ela o
seguiu, entorpecida, atravessando a rua, subindo os
degraus cinza, onde uma porta preta foi aberta por um
homem minúsculo, de rosto vermelho, num terno escuro
justo, Petal passando por ele como se não estivesse lá.– Espere aí – disse o rosto vermelho. – Swain quer vê-la
agora...
As palavras do homem fizeram com que Petal parasse no
mesmo instante; com um grunhido, girou numa
velocidade desconcertante e agarrou o cara pelo
colarinho.
– No futuro é melhor mostrar respeito – disse Petal, e
embora não tivesse erguido a voz, de algum modo toda a
sua gentileza entediada havia desaparecido. Kumiko
ouviu algumas costuras estourarem.
– Desculpa, chefe. – O rosto vermelho estava
cuidadosamente impassível. – Ele me disse para lhe falar.
– Venha – disse Petal para ela, soltando a lapela escura. –
Ele só quer dizer oi.
Encontraram Swain sentado numa mesa de refeitório –
no cômodo onde ela o havia visto pela
primeira vez, os dragões de sua hierarquia abotoados
sob uma camisa de flanela e uma gravata de seda
listrada. Seus olhos encontraram os dela assim que
entrou, seu rosto de ossos longos sombreado por uma
luminária de leitura em bronze que ficava ao lado de um
pequeno console e uma grossa pilha de fax na mesa. –
Bom – disse ele –, como foi lá no Sprawl?
– Estou muito cansada, sr. Swain. Gostaria de ir para o
meu quarto.
– Estamos contentes em tê-la de volta, Kumiko. O Sprawl
é um lugar perigoso. Os amigos deSally provavelmente não são o tipo de pessoa de quem
seu pai gostaria que você se aproximasse.
– Posso ir para o meu quarto agora?
– Você encontrou algum dos amigos de Sally, Kumiko?
– Não.
– Verdade? O que vocês fizeram?
– Nada.
– Você não deve ficar brava conosco, Kumiko. Estamos
protegendo você.
– Obrigada. Posso ir para o meu quarto agora?
– Claro. Você deve estar bem cansada.
Petal a seguiu para o quarto, carregando sua mala, seu
terno cinza dobrado e amassado por causa do voo. Ela
teve o cuidado de não espiar enquanto passavam perto
do busto de mármore onde a unidade Maas-Neotek
talvez continuasse escondida, embora não pudesse
pegá-la com Swain e Petal
na sala.
***
Havia um novo sentido de movimento na casa, enérgico
e com sons abafados: vozes, passos, o
barulho do elevador, canos rangendo enquanto alguém
tomava banho.Ela se sentou ao pé da enorme cama, encarando a
banheira de mármore negro. Imagens
residuais de Nova York pareciam flutuar nos limites de
seu campo visual; se fechasse os olhos, ela se veria de
volta no beco, espremendo-se junto a Sally. Sally, que a
havia mandado embora. Que não havia olhado para trás.
Sally, cujo nome já havia sido Molly, ou Misty, ou ambos.
Novamente, sua indignidade. Sumida, sua mãe boiando
na água escura. Seu pai. Sally.
Momentos depois, levada por uma curiosidade mais forte
que sua vergonha, levantou-se,
escovou o cabelo, calçou meias de borracha escura com
solado de plástico com sulcos e dirigiu-se, muito
silenciosamente, para o corredor. Quando o elevador
chegou, fedia a cigarro.
O rosto vermelho estava andando de um lado para outro
no vestíbulo acarpetado em azul quando ela saiu do
elevador, suas mãos nos bolsos do casaco preto justo. –
Ei – disse ele, erguendo as sobrancelhas –, você precisa
de alguma coisa?
– Estou com fome – disse ela, em japonês. – Vou até a
cozinha.
– Ei – disse ele, tirando as mãos dos bolsos e ajeitando a
frente do casaco – você fala inglês?
– Não – disse ela, e caminhou direto pelo corredor,
passando por ele, dobrando a esquina. – Ei –
ouviu-o dizer, com um pouco mais de urgência, mas ela
já estava tateando atrás do busto branco.Conseguiu colocar a unidade dentro do bolso pouco
antes que ele aparecesse. Ele inspecionou o
cômodo automaticamente, as mãos soltas ao lado do seu
corpo, de um modo que subitamente lembrou-a dos
secretários de seu pai.
– Estou com fome – disse ela, em inglês.
Cinco minutos depois, havia retornado ao seu quarto com
uma laranja grande e de aparência muito britânica: os
ingleses pareciam não dar nenhum valor especial à
simetria das frutas. Fechando a porta atrás dela, colocou
a laranja na ampla borda da banheira preta e tirou a
unidade Maas-Neotek do bolso.
– Rápido agora – disse Colin, jogando para trás seu
topete quando entrou em foco –, abra a unidade e
coloque o interruptor A/B na posição A. O novo regime
tem um técnico fazendo rondas e
procurando grampos. Assim que você mudar o ajuste,
isso não deve aparecer como um dispositivo
de escuta. – Ela fez como ele disse, usando um grampo
de cabelo.
– O que você quer dizer – perguntou ela, movendo os
lábios sem emitir sons – com o novo regime?
– Não percebeu? Há pelo menos
funcionários agora, sem mencionar os
uma
dúzia
de
numerosos visitantes. Bem, suponho que seja menos um
novo regime do que uma melhoria no procedimento. Esse
sr. Swain é um homem bastante sociável, do seu jeito
dissimulado. Tem uma conversa aqui entre Swain e odiretor adjunto do Special Branch que, imagino, milhares
de pessoas literalmente matariam para ter, inclusive o
oficial mencionado.
– Special Branch?
– A polícia política. Swain anda com figuras muito
variadas: pessoal da Buck House, chefões do
East End, chefes de polícia...
– Buck House?
– O Palácio de Buckingham. Sem mencionar o pessoal do
mercado financeiro da City, uma estrela de simstim, um
bando ou dois de agiotas caros e traficantes de drogas...
– Uma estrela de simstim?
– Lanier, Robin Lanier.
– Robin Lanier? Ele esteve aqui?
– Na manhã seguinte à sua partida precipitada.
Ela olhou para os olhos verdes transparentes de Colin. –
Você está me dizendo a verdade?
– Sim.
– Você sempre diz a verdade?
– Até onde eu saiba, sim.
– O que você é?
– Um biochip Maas-Neotek baseado em personalidade
programado para ajudar e aconselhar avisitante japonesa no Reino Unido. – Ele piscou para ela.
– Por que você piscou?
– O que você acha?
– Responda à pergunta! – A voz dela alta, no quarto
espelhado.
O fantasma tocou os lábios com seu dedo indicador. – Eu
sou outra coisa também, sim. Eu realmente mostro
iniciativa demais para ser um mero programa de guia.
Embora o modelo no qual
sou baseado seja o mais avançado da
extremamente sofisticado. Não posso lhe
exatamente o que sou, contudo, porque não sei.
linha,
dizer
– Você não sabe? – Novamente, sem emitir os sons,
cuidadosamente.
– Conheço uma enormidade de coisas – disse ele, e foi
para uma das claraboias. – Eu sei que uma mesa de
servir no Middle Temple Hall é feita de madeira
proveniente do Golden Hind; que é preciso subir cento e
vinte e oito degraus para chegar à passarela da ponte de
Londres; que em Wood Street, à direita de Cheapside, há
uma árvore que dizem ter sido aquela na qual cantava o
tordo de Wordsworth... – Virou-se subitamente para
encará-la. – Não é verdade, contudo, porque a árvore
atual foi clonada da original em 1998. Eu sei tudo isso,
veja você, e mais, muito mais. Poderia, por exemplo,
ensinar-lhe os princípios da sinuca. É isso o que eu sou,
ou pelo menos o que era para eu ser, originalmente.
Porém sou algo mais, e muito provavelmente isso tem a
ver com você. Eu não sei o quê. Realmente não sei.– Você foi um presente do meu pai. Você se comunica
com ele?
– Não que eu saiba.
– Você não o informou sobre minha partida?
– Você não entende – disse ele. – Eu não sabia que você
tinha estado ausente até você me ativar,
momentos atrás.
– Mas você tem estado gravando...
– Sim, mas não estou consciente disso. Só estou “aqui”
quando você me aciona. Então avalio os
dados atuais... De uma coisa você pode estar certa,
contudo: é simplesmente impossível transmitir qualquer
tipo de sinal desta casa sem que os detectores de Swain
o captem imediatamente.
– Poderia haver mais de você, quero dizer um outro,
nessa mesma unidade?
– Ideia interessante, mas não, exceto se houver uma
tecnologia de vanguarda altamente secreta.
Já estou um pouco além dos limites atuais, considerando-
se o tamanho do meu hardware. Sei disso
pela informação geral que tenho armazenada.
Ela olhou para a unidade em sua mão. – Lanier – disse
ela. – Conte–me.
– Dez/vinte e cinco/dezesseis: A.M. – disse ele. A cabeça
dela se encheu de vozes incorpóreas...PETAL: Se quiser me seguir, por favor, senhor...
SWAIN: Venha até a sala de bilhar.
TERCEIRA VOZ: É melhor você ter um motivo para isso,
Swain. Há três homens da Net esperando
no carro. A Segurança vai ficar com teu endereço no
banco de dados até que o inferno congele.
PETAL: É um belo carro aquele, senhor, o Daimler. Deseja
que segure o seu casaco?
TERCEIRA VOZ: O que é isto, Swain? Por que não
pudemos nos encontrar no Brown’s?
SWAIN: Tire seu casaco, Robin. Ela se foi.
TERCEIRA VOZ: Se foi?
SWAIN: Para o Sprawl. Pela manhã, cedo.
TERCEIRA VOZ: Mas não é hora...
SWAIN: Você acha que eu a mandei para lá?
A resposta do homem foi vaga, indistinguível, perdida
atrás de uma porta fechando. – Aquele era Lanier? –
Perguntou Kumiko, silenciosamente.
– Sim – respondeu Colin. – Petal chamou-o pelo nome
numa conversa anterior. Swain e Lanier
passaram vinte e cinco minutos juntos.
Som de uma tranca, movimento.SWAIN: Bela cagada, mas não minha. Alertei você sobre
ela, falei para você alertá-los. Assassina
nata, provavelmente psicopata...
LANIER: É problema seu, não meu. Você precisa do
produto deles e da minha cooperação.
SWAIN: E qual é o seu problema, Lanier? Por que você
está nesta? Só para tirar Mitchell do caminho?
LANIER: Onde está o meu casaco?
SWAIN: Petal, a droga do casaco do senhor Lanier.
PETAL: Senhor.
LANIER: Eu tenho a impressão de que eles querem a sua
razorgirl tanto quanto querem Angie. Ela
é, definitivamente,
também.
parte
do
prêmio.
Vão
pegá-la,
SWAIN: Boa sorte para eles, então. Ela já está em
posição, no Sprawl. Falei com ela por telefone, há uma
hora. Vou colocá-la em contato com o meu homem lá,
aquele que tem feito preparativos para
a... garota. E você, vai voltar de fato?
LANIER: Esta noite.
SWAIN: Bem, então, nada para se preocupar.
LANIER: Adeus, Swain.
PETAL: Um completo escroto, esse.SWAIN: Não gosto nada disso, nem um pouco...
PETAL: Mas gosta dos benefícios, não?
SWAIN: Não posso reclamar, mas por que você acha que
eles também querem a Sally?
PETAL: Só Deus sabe. Eles que se virem com ela.
SWAIN: Eles. Eu não gosto deste negócio de “eles”...
PETAL: Eles não podem estar terrivelmente felizes em
saber que ela foi para lá por conta própria, com a filha de
Yanaka...
SWAIN: Não. Mas agora temos a senhorita Yanaka de
volta. Amanhã direi a Sally que Prior está
em Baltimore, colocando a garota em forma...
PETAL: Esse é um negócio bem ruim, bem ruim...
SWAIN: Traga um bule de café para o escritório.
***
Ela deitou-se de costas, os olhos fechados, as gravações
de Colin projetando-se em sua cabeça,
diretamente em seus nervos auditivos. Swain parecia
conduzir a maior parte de seus negócios na sala de
bilhar, o que significava que ela ouvia pessoas chegando
e saindo, inícios e fins de diálogos. Dois homens, um dos
quais deve ter sido o rosto vermelho, manteve uma
discussão interminável sobre corridas de cachorro e as
apostas para o dia seguinte. Ela ouviu com especial
interesse quando Swain e o homem das forças especiais,
o Special Branch (SB, Swain chamava) travavam umaconversa de negócios diretamente debaixo do busto de
mármore, enquanto o homem se preparava para sair. Ela
interrompeu este segmento uma meia dúzia de vezes em
busca de esclarecimento. Colin fez suposições
inteligentes.
– Este é um país muito corrupto – disse ela por fim,
profundamente chocada.
– Talvez não mais do que o seu próprio país – disse ele.
– Mas com o que Swain está pagando esta gente?
– Informação. Eu diria que nosso senhor
recentemente adquiriu uma fonte de inteligência
Swain
de alto nível, e está ocupado em convertê-la em poder.
Com base no que ouvimos, me arriscaria a dizer que esta
tem sido sua linha de trabalho por algum tempo. O que
está aparente, contudo, é que ele está subindo na
hierarquia, se tornando mais importante. Há evidências
internas de que ele é atualmente um homem muito mais
importante do que era há uma semana. Além disso, há o
fato de
que ele está ampliando sua equipe...
– Devo contar isso para... minha amiga.
– Shears? Contar o que para ela?
– O que Lanier disse. Que ela será levada, junto com
Angela Mitchell.
– Onde ela está?
– O Sprawl. Um hotel...– Ligue para ela. Mas não daqui. Você tem dinheiro?
– Um chip do Mitsubank.
– Não serve para nossos telefones, sinto muito. Tem
alguma moeda?
Ela se levantou da cama e procurou cuidadosamente as
moedas de dinheiro inglês que havia acumulado no fundo
de sua bolsa. – Aqui – disse ela, segurando uma moeda
dourada –, dez libras.
– Precisa de duas dessas para fazer uma ligação local. –
Ela jogou a moeda de volta na bolsa.
– Não, Colin. Não usarei o telefone. Há um jeito melhor.
Eu quero sair daqui. Agora. Hoje. Você
vai me ajudar?
– Certamente – disse ele –, embora eu não lhe aconselhe
a fazer isso.
– Mas eu vou.
– Muito bem. Como você propõe conseguir fazer isso?
– Vou dizer a eles que preciso fazer compras.

MENINA MÁ
A mulher deve ter chegado após a meia-noite, pensou
mais tarde, porque foi depois que Prior
tinha voltado com os caranguejos, o segundo pacote de
caranguejos. Realmente tinham ótimos caranguejos emBaltimore, e o wiz sempre lhe abria o apetite, então ela o
convenceu a voltar e buscar mais. Gerald continuava
vindo trocar os dermas nos braços dela; ela sempre o
recebia com seu sorriso mais tolo, espremendo para fora
o tranquilizante cada vez que ele saía e depois
recolocando o adesivo de volta no lugar. Finalmente,
Gerald disse que ela deveria dormir. Apagou as luzes e
ajustou a janela falsa para a imagem mais suave, um pôr
do sol avermelhado.
Quando ficou sozinha novamente, escorregou a mão por
entre a cama e a parede, encontrou a
arma de choque em seu buraco na espuma.
Adormeceu sem querer, o brilho vermelho da janela
como o pôr do sol em Miami, e ela deve
ter sonhado com Eddy, ou pelo menos com o Hooky
Green’s, dançando com alguém lá em cima no
33º andar, porque quando o barulho a acordou, ela não
estava muito certa de onde se encontrava, mas tinha
este mapa muito claro em sua cabeça de como sair do
Hooky Green’s, como se ele soubesse que era melhor
pegar as escadas porque havia algum tipo de problema...
Estava saindo da cama quando Prior atravessou a porta,
literalmente através da porta, já que ela ainda estava
fechada quando ele a atingiu. Ele a atravessou de trás
para a frente e foi parar sobre estilhaços e pedaços de
papelão.
Ela o viu chocar-se contra a parede e depois o chão, e
então já não estava se movendo mais euma outra pessoa estava lá na porta, iluminada por trás,
pela luz do outro quarto, e tudo que ela podia ver do
rosto eram aqueles dois círculos de luz vermelha, reflexo
do pôr do sol falso.
Colocou as pernas de volta na cama, encostou-se contra
à parede, sua mão escorregando para...
– Não se mexa, sua vagabunda. – Havia alguma coisa
realmente amedrontadora naquela voz, porque era
alegre demais, como se atirar Prior através da porta
fosse algo realmente divertido. – E
isso quer dizer realmente não se mexer... – A mulher
atravessou o quarto em três passos, muito próxima, tão
próxima que Mona sentiu o frio da jaqueta de couro.
– Ok – disse Mona –, ok...
Então as mãos a agarraram, rápido, e ela estava jogada
de costas, ombros pressionados fortemente contra a
espuma e alguma coisa – a arma de choque – bem em
frente ao seu rosto.
– Onde você conseguiu esta coisinha?
– Oh – disse Mona, como se fosse algo do qual ela havia
se esquecido –, estava na jaqueta do
meu namorado. Eu peguei a jaqueta emprestada...
O coração de Mona estava acelerado. Havia alguma coisa
a respeito daqueles óculos...
– Esse merda aí sabia que você tinha esta coisinha?
– Quem?– Prior – disse a mulher, e largou-a, virando-se. Estava
chutando Prior, várias vezes, com força.
– Não – disse ela, parando tão abruptamente quanto
começou. – Acho que Prior não sabia. – Gerald
estava na porta, como se nada houvesse acontecido,
exceto por seu olhar triste para a parte da porta que
havia sobrado no caixilho, correndo seu polegar sobre
uma ponta de laminado lascado. – Café,
Molly?
– Dois cafés, Gerald – disse a mulher, examinando a
arma de choque. – O meu, forte.
***
Mona bebeu seu café e estudou as roupas e o cabelo da
mulher enquanto esperavam Prior acordar. Pelo menos
era o que pareciam estar fazendo. Gerald tinha saído
novamente. Ela não era nada parecida com qualquer
pessoa que Mona já tivesse visto antes; Mona não era
capaz de encaixá-la em seu mapa de estilos, só sabia
que ela tinha dinheiro. O cabelo era europeu; Mona já
havia visto um igual àquele numa revista; tinha certeza
de que não era o estilo da moda em lugar algum, mas
ficava legal com as lentes, que eram inseridas,
implantadas direto na pele. Tinha visto um taxista em
Cleveland com um daqueles. E ela vestia uma jaqueta
curta, marrom-escura, muito simples para o gosto de
Mona mas obviamente nova, com uma grande lapela de
pele de carneiro, agora aberta mostrando uma coisa
verde bizarra colada aos seus seios e ao estômago, como
uma armadura, era oque Mona pensava que fosse, e jeans cortados em algum
tipo de camurça cinza-esverdeada, grossa e
macia, e Mona pensou que os jeans eram a coisa mais
bacana no visual dela, que poderia comprar um par
daqueles para si mesma, exceto que as botas
estragavam tudo, botas pretas de cano alto, do tipo que
os motoqueiros usavam, com solados amarelos de
borracha, grossos, e grandes tiras ao redor do peito do
pé, fivelas cromadas de cima a baixo, o bico
horrivelmente esquisito. E onde é que ela havia
conseguido aquela cor de unha, aquele Borgonha? Mona
achava que nem fabricavam mais aquele troço.
– Está olhando o quê?
– Ah... suas botas.
– E daí?
– Elas não combinam com suas calças.
– Usei porque queria chutar Prior e ferrar com ele.
Prior gemeu no chão, como se fosse vomitar. Isso fez
Mona sentir-se enjoada, então disse que ia
ao banheiro.
– Nem pense em fugir. – A mulher parecia estar vigiando
Prior, sobre o branco de sua xícara de
porcelana, mas com aqueles óculos, era difícil ter
certeza.
***De algum modo, ela se viu no banheiro com a bolsa em
seu colo. Apressou-se para ajustar a dose; não esmagou
bem o suficiente, então a droga ardeu no fundo da
garganta, mas como Lanette
costumava dizer, nem sempre se tem tempo para os
detalhes. De qualquer maneira, não estava tudo
muito melhor agora? Havia um pequeno chuveiro no
banheiro de Gerald, mas parecia que não era
usado há muito tempo. Ela deu uma olhada mais de
perto e viu mofo cinza se formando ao redor do
ralo, e manchas que pareciam sangue seco.
Quando voltou, a mulher estava arrastando Prior para um
dos outros quartos, puxando-o pelos
pés. Ele estava de meias, sem sapatos, Mona percebeu
agora, como se tivesse colocado os pés para
cima para dormir. Sua camisa azul estava manchada de
sangue e seu rosto, todo cheio de hematomas.
O que Mona sentiu, quando a dose começou a fazer
efeito, foi uma curiosidade inocente e brilhante. – O que
você está fazendo?
– Acho que vou ter que acordá-lo – disse a mulher, como
se ela estivesse no metrô, falando sobre um outro
passageiro que estava para perder sua parada. Mona
seguiu-a para dentro da sala onde Gerald fazia seu
trabalho, tudo limpo e branco como um hospital;
observou enquanto a mulhercolocava Prior em pé numa espécie de cadeira de
barbearia, com pedais e botões e coisas. Ela não parece
ser extremamente forte, pensou Mona, é mais o jeito
como ela sabe jogar com o peso. A cabeça de Prior caiu
de lado enquanto a mulher apertava um cinto preto ao
redor de seu peito. Mona estava começando a sentir
pena dele, mas então se lembrou de Eddy.
– O que é isto? – A mulher estava enchendo um frasco de
plástico branco com água de uma torneira cromada.
Mona queria contar, sentindo seu coração em disparada
por causa do wiz. Ele matou Eddy, continuava tentando
dizer, mas não saía. Então deve ter conseguido, porque a
mulher respondeu – É o tipo de coisa que ele faz... se
você deixar. – Ela jogou a água sobre Prior, em seu rosto
e sobre a camisa; seus olhos se abriram e o olho
esquerdo estava todo vermelho; a forquilha de metal da
arma de choque disparou fagulhas brancas quando a
mulher a pressionou contra a camisa azul molhada.
Prior gritou.
***
Gerald teve que ficar de quatro para tirá-la de baixo da
cama. Ele tinha mãos frias, muito gentis.
Ela não conseguia se lembrar de como tinha ido parar lá
embaixo, mas agora tudo estava quieto.
Gerald vestia um casaco cinza e óculos escuros.
– Você vai com a Molly agora, Mona – disse ele.
Ela começou a tremer.– Acho melhor eu te dar alguma coisa para os nervos.
Ela se atirou para trás, longe das mãos dele. – Não! Não
encosta em mim!
– Deixa, Gerald – disse a mulher na porta. – É hora de
você ir agora.
– Não acho que você saiba o que está fazendo – disse ele
–, mas boa sorte.
– Obrigada. Acha que vai sentir falta daqui?
– Não. Estava querendo me aposentar logo, de qualquer
maneira.
– Eu também – disse a mulher, e Gerald saiu, sem sequer
acenar em despedida para Mona.
– Tem alguma roupa? – a mulher perguntou para Mona. –
Vista-se. Estamos indo, também.
Vestindo-se, Mona descobriu que não conseguia abotoar
o vestido sobre seus novos peitos; ela o
deixou aberto, colocando a jaqueta de Michael por cima e
subindo o zíper até o queixo.

COMPANHIA
De vez em quando tudo o que queria era ficar lá, olhando
o Juiz, ou agachar-se no concreto ao
lado da Bruxa. Fazer isso evitava os lapsos de memória.
Não as fugas, os flashbacks reais, mas esta estúpida
sensação desfocada que tinha, como se a fita dememória ficasse saindo do lugar em sua cabeça,
perdendo os pormenores de experiência... Então era o
que estava fazendo naquele momento, e estava
funcionando, e finalmente percebeu que Cherry estava
lá, ao seu lado.
Gentry estava em pé no loft com a forma que havia
capturado, o que ele chamava nodo de macroforma, e
ele mal tinha escutado o que Slick havia tentado lhe
dizer sobre a casa e todo aquele lugar e Bobby, o Conde.
Então Slick havia descido para agachar-se ao lado de um
Investigador no frio e no escuro, repassando todas as
coisas que havia feito com tantas ferramentas diferentes,
e onde havia conseguido cada peça, e então Cherry
estendeu sua mão fria e tocou-o na bochecha.
– Você está bem? – perguntou. – Eu achei que estivesse
tendo outro episódio...
– Não. É que tenho que descer aqui, às vezes.
– Ele te plugou na caixa do Conde, não foi?
– Bobby – disse Slick –, é como ele se chama. Eu o vi.
– Onde?
– Lá dentro. É todo um mundo. Há esta casa, como um
castelo ou algo assim, e ele está lá.
– Sozinho?
– Ele disse que Angie Mitchell está lá também...
– Talvez ele esteja louco. Ela está mesmo lá?
– Eu não a vi. Mas vi um carro, supostamente dela.– Ela está em um centro de desintoxicação na Jamaica. –
Ele sacudiu os ombros. – Não sei.
– Como ele é?
– Ele parece mais jovem. Qualquer um pareceria mal com
todos esses tubos e outras porcarias.
Ele achou que Kid Afrika largou-o aqui porque ficou com
medo. Disse que se qualquer um vier procurar por ele, é
para plugá-lo na matrix.
– Por quê?
– Não sei.
– Você deveria ter perguntado.
Ele sacudiu os ombros novamente. – Viu o Bird por aí?
– Não.
– Já deveria ter voltado... – Ficou em pé.

Little Bird voltou ao anoitecer, na moto de Gentry, as
asas escuras de seu cabelo úmidas pela neve e
ondulando atrás dele enquanto acelerava pela Solitude.
Slick franziu o rosto: Little Bird estava na marcha errada.
Little Bird subiu sobre uma pilha de barris de óleo
compactados e freou quando
deveria ter acelerado. Cherry prendeu a respiração
enquanto Bird e a moto se separaram em pleno ar; a
moto parecia ter ficado suspensa ali, por um segundo,
antes de dar um salto mortal e cair sobre o entulho defolhas de metal que tinha sido um dos anexos da Fábrica,
e Little Bird estava rolando várias vezes no chão.
Slick não chegou a ouvir o impacto. Estava em pé ao lado
de Cherry, na cobertura de uma rampa de carga sem
porta – em seguida estava correndo através da ferrugem
coberta de neve, em direção ao motoqueiro caído, sem
transição. Little Bird estava deitado de costas, com
sangue nos lábios, sua boca parcialmente escondida pelo
amontoado de ossos de diversos animais e antigos
cartuchos de munição de latão que usava em volta do
pescoço.
– Não encoste nele – disse Cherry. – Pode ter quebrado
uma costela, ou pode ter se arrebentado
por dentro...
Os olhos de Little Bird se abriram ao som da voz dela. Ele
cerrou os lábios e cuspiu sangue e
parte de um dente.
– Não se mexa – disse Cherry, ajoelhando-se ao lado dele
e falando com a dicção ríspida que
havia aprendido na escola de tec-meds. – Você pode
estar ferido...
– Foda-se, garota – ele deu um jeito de erguer-se com a
ajuda de Slick.
– Tudo bem, seu merda – respondeu –, se tiver uma
hemorragia, azar seu.
– Não consegui – disse Little Bird, limpando o sangue de
seu rosto com as costas da mão – ocaminhão.
– Deu para notar – disse Slick.
– Marvie e os caras, eles têm companhia. Como moscas
ao redor de merda. Alguns hovercrafts
e um helicóptero e mais umas merdas. Todos aqueles
caras.
– Que tipo de caras?
– Parecem soldados, mas não são. Soldados ficam de
bobeira, fazendo merda e contam piadas
quando ninguém importante está olhando. Mas não eles.
– Tiras? – Marvie e seus dois irmãos cultivavam
variedades de maconha mutante numa dúzia de
vagões de trem semissoterrados; às vezes, eles
tentavam produzir compostos primitivos de amina, mas
seu laboratório quase sempre explodia. Eles eram a coisa
mais próxima da noção de vizinhos permanentes que a
Fábrica tinha. Viviam a seis quilômetros dali.
– Tiras? – Little Bird cuspiu outro pedaço de dente e
vasculhou cuidadosamente sua boca com
um dedo ensanguentado. – Os caras não estão fazendo
nada contra a lei. De qualquer maneira, os tiras não têm
grana para aquelas coisas, hovercrafts novos, um Honda
novo... – Ele deu um meio sorriso
sob uma película de sangue e saliva. – Fiquei de tocaia
em Solitude e dei uma boa olhada neles.Ninguém com quem eu gostaria de conversar, nem você.
Acho que detonei mesmo a moto do Gentry,
hein?
– Não se preocupe com isso – disse Slick. – Acho que a
mente dele está ocupada com outra coisa.
– Que bom... – Caminhou, mancando, em direção à
Fábrica, quase caiu, se recompôs, continuou.
– Ele está completamente drogado – disse Cherry.
– Ei, Bird – chamou Slick –, o que aconteceu com o pacote
de bagulho que te dei para entregar a
Marvie?
Bird oscilou, virou-se. – Perdi... – Então desapareceu,
atrás de uma pilha de zinco.
– Talvez ele esteja inventando tudo – disse Cherry. –
Sobre aqueles caras. Ou vendo coisas.
– Duvido – disse Slick, empurrando-a para uma sombra
ao notar que um Honda preto, com as
luzes apagadas, descia em direção à Fábrica, saído do
crepúsculo do inverno.
***
Ele ouviu o Honda fazer sua quinta passagem pela
Fábrica enquanto subia pelas escadas que rangiam, o
telhado de metal chacoalhando com a passagem do
helicóptero. Bem, pensou ele, pelo menos isso faria
Gentry notar que temos visitantes. Ele caminhou pela
passarela em dez passos longos e lentos; estavacomeçando a se perguntar se conseguiriam passar de
volta com o Conde e sua maca para os fundos, sem ter
que prender uma viga extra nas alças.
Entrou no loft iluminado sem bater. Gentry estava
sentado na mesa de trabalho, sua cabeça virada para o
lado, encarando a claraboia de plástico. A bancada
estava cheia de pedaços de hardware e pequenas
ferramentas.
– Helicóptero – disse Slick, ofegante por causa da subida.
– Helicóptero – concordou Gentry, sacudindo a cabeça
pensativamente, seu cabelo desgrenhado
se agitando. – Eles parecem estar procurando alguma
coisa.
– Acho que acabaram de encontrá-la.
– Podia ser a Autoridade de Fissão.
– Bird disse que viu gente lá no Marvie. Viu este
helicóptero por lá também. Você não estava prestando
muita atenção quando tentei lhe contar o que ele disse.
– Bird? – Gentry olhou para baixo, para as pequenas
coisas brilhantes na mesa de trabalho.
Pegou dois conectores e juntou-os.
– O Conde! Ele me disse...
– Bobby Newmark – disse Gentry –, sim. Sei muito mais
sobre Bobby Newmark, agora.
Cherry entrou atrás de Slick. – Você tem que fazer
alguma coisa sobre aquela ponte – disse, dirigindo-seimediatamente para a maca –, ela sacode muito. –
Debruçou-se para checar as leituras do Conde.
– Venha até aqui, Slick – disse Gentry, levantando-se.
Caminhou até a mesa holográfica. Slick o
seguiu, olhando para a imagem que brilhava lá.
Lembrou-se dos tapetes que havia visto na casa cinza,
padronagens como aquela, só que agora eram tecidos de
neon muito fino, entrelaçados em algum tipo de nó
infinito; sua cabeça doía só de olhar para o centro do nó.
Desviou o olhar.
– É isso? – perguntou para Gentry. – O que você sempre
esteve procurando?
– Não. Eu lhe disse. Isso é apenas uma nodo, uma
macroforma. Um modelo...
– Ele tem esta casa lá, como um castelo, e grama e
árvores e céu...
– Ele tem muito mais do que isso. Tem um universo a
mais do que isso. Aquilo é apenas um constructo criado a
partir de um stim comercial. O que ele tem é um resumo
da soma total de dados que constituem o ciberespaço.
Ainda assim, é o mais próximo que já cheguei até hoje...
Ele não lhe disse por que está lá?
– Não perguntei.
– Então, você vai ter que voltar.
– Ei, Gentry. Ouça. Aquele helicóptero vai voltar. Vai
voltar com dois hovers cheios de caras que Bird disse
parecerem soldados. Eles não estão atrás de nós, cara.
Estão atrás dele.– Talvez seja o pessoal dele. Talvez estejam atrás de nós.
– Não. Ele me disse, cara. Disse que se alguém viesse
procurar por ele, estaríamos numa grande
merda, e deveríamos plugá-lo na matrix.
Gentry olhou para baixo, para o pequeno encaixe que
ainda segurava. – Nós vamos falar com
ele, Slick. Você vai voltar e, desta vez, vou contigo.

VIAGEM DE INVERNO
Petal tinha concordado, por fim, mas apenas depois que
ela sugeriu telefonar para seu pai pedindo permissão. Foi
procurar Swain, resignado, e quando voltou, parecendo
igualmente infeliz, a resposta tinha sido sim. Envolta em
várias camadas de suas roupas mais quentes, Kumiko
esperou no vestíbulo pintando de branco, estudando as
pinturas de caça enquanto Petal orientava o homem de
rosto vermelho, que se chamava Dick, atrás de portas
fechadas.
Não
podiam
distinguir
as
palavras
individualmente, só uma torrente de advertências em voz
baixa. A unidade Maas-Neotek estava em seu bolso, mas
evitava tocá-la. Colin já havia tentado fazê-la desistir
duas vezes.
Dick retornou da conversa com Petal, um sorriso
congelado em seus pequenos lábios rígidos.
Debaixo de seu terno preto e justo, vestia uma blusa de
gola olímpica e um casaco de lã cinza. Seu cabelo preto
estava colado contra sua cabeça com gel; suas
bochechas pálidas estavam acinzentadas por algumashoras sem se barbear. Ela segurou a unidade em seu
bolso. – Olá – disse Dick, olhando-a de cima para baixo. –
Onde vamos passear?
– Portobello Road – disse Colin, apoiado, indolentemente,
contra a parede, ao lado do cabideiro
lotado. Dick pegou um sobretudo escuro do cabideiro,
atravessando Colin para tanto, vestiu-o e abotoou-o.
Colocou um pesado par de luvas de couro preto.
– Portobello Road – disse Kumiko, largando a unidade.
***
– Há quanto tempo você trabalha para o sr. Swain? –
perguntou ela, enquanto abriam caminho
no asfalto coberto de gelo da alameda.
– O bastante – respondeu ele. – Cuidado para não
escorregar. Saltos traiçoeiros nessas botas...
Kumiko caminhava ao lado dele em pequenos saltos, em
suas botas francesas negras com espigões. Como havia
previsto, era virtualmente impossível caminhar por entre
as placas rígidas de gelo com aquelas botas. Segurou a
mão dele para equilibrar-se; e, ao fazê-lo, sentiu um
metal sólido na sua palma. As luvas tinham material de
enchimento, os dedos eram reforçados com liga de
carbono.
Ele permanecia calado enquanto viravam na
transversal à alameda, mas quando chegaram a
rua
Portobello Road, deu uma parada. – Desculpe, senhorita –
disse ele, um tom de hesitação em sua voz–, mas o que os rapazes andam dizendo, é verdade?
– Rapazes? Como assim?
– Os rapazes de Swain, o pessoal que fica por lá. Que
você é filha do chefão... o chefão lá de Tóquio?
– Desculpe – disse ela –, eu não entendo.
– Yanaka. Seu nome é Yanaka?
– Kumiko Yanaka, sim...
Olhou para ela com intensa curiosidade. Depois pareceu
preocupado e olhou cuidadosamente em volta. – Meu
Deus – disse ele –, então deve ser verdade... – Seu corpo
atarracado, firmemente abotoado, estava tenso e alerta.
– O patrão disse que você queria fazer compras?
– Sim, obrigada.
– Aonde vamos?
– Aqui – disse ela, e levou-o para dentro de uma galeria
estreita, solidamente preenchida com
gomi britânico.
***
Suas expedições para compras em Shinjuku foram úteis
para lidar com Dick. As técnicas que havia desenvolvido
para torturar os secretários de seu pai provaram ser
eficientes agora, quando forçava o homem a participar
de dúzias de escolhas sem sentido entre um medalhão
eduardiano e outro, este ou aquele fragmento de vitral,
ainda que tivesse o cuidado de escolher apenas itens quefossem frágeis ou muito pesados, difíceis de carregar e
extremamente caros. Uma alegre vendedora
bilíngue efetuou uma cobrança de 80 mil libras no chip
MitsuBank de Kumiko. Kumiko escorregou a
mão para dentro do bolso em que mantinha a unidade
Maas-Neotek. – Refinado – disse a garota inglesa em
japonês, enquanto embalava uma das compras de
Kumiko, um vaso de bronze dourado incrustado com
grifos.
– Horrível – comentou Colin, em japonês. – Uma imitação,
ainda por cima. – Ele se reclinou num sofá vitoriano
forrado com pelo de cavalo, suas botas apoiadas numa
bandeja de coquetel art déco sustentada por anjos de
alumínio aerodinâmicos.
A vendedora acrescentou o vaso embalado à carga de
Dick. Esta era a décima primeira loja de
antiguidades em que Dick entrava e a oitava compra de
Kumiko.
– Acho melhor você tomar a iniciativa agora – aconselhou
Colin. – A qualquer momento, nosso
Dick aqui vai chamar Swain pedindo um carro para levar
todas essas coisas para casa.
– Nós terminamos, então? – perguntou
esperançoso, sobre as compras de Kumiko.
Dick,
– Só mais uma loja, por favor. – Kumiko sorriu.
– Certo – disse ele, sorrindo forçosamente. Enquanto a
seguia em direção à porta, ela prendeu osalto da bota esquerda numa fenda no asfalto que ela
havia visto antes de entrar. – Você está bem? –
perguntou ele, vendo-a se desequilibrar.
– Quebrei o salto da minha bota... – Voltou mancando
para a loja e sentou-se ao lado de Colin no
sofá de pelo de cavalo. A vendedora veio correndo para
ajudar.
– Tire-as rapidamente – aconselhou Colin –, antes que
Dick largue os pacotes.
Ela abriu o zíper da bota com o salto quebrado, depois
abriu a outra, tirou as duas. No lugar das meias comuns
de seda chinesa grossa que costumava vestir no inverno,
seus pés estavam envoltos em meias de borracha escura
com um grosso solado de plástico estriado. Quase passou
por entre as pernas de Dick quando saiu pela porta, mas
em vez disso esbarrou nele enquanto se espremia para
sair, fazendo-o cair sobre uma vitrine de decantadores de
cristal.
E então ela estava livre, mergulhando entre a massa de
turistas de Portobello Road.
***
Seus pés estavam muito frios, mas as solas de plástico
rígido forneciam uma excelente tração, a
não ser no gelo, lembrou-se, levantando-se de seu
segundo escorregão, terra úmida em suas palmas.
Colin a guiou para uma passagem estreita de tijolos
es
