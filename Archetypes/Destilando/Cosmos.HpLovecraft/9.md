stock in what people around here say. They‘re hard to get started, but once they do get
started they never let up. They‘ve ben telling things about Innsmouth—whispering ‘em,
mostly—for the last hundred years, I guess, and I gather they‘re more scared than anything
else. Some of the stories would make you laugh—about old Captain Marsh driving bargains
with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of devil-
worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around
1845 or thereabouts—but I come from Panton, Vermont, and that kind of story don‘t go down
with me.
―You ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about the black reef off the
coast—Devil Reef, they call it. It‘s well above water a good part of the time, and never much
below it, but at that you could hardly call it an island. The story is that there‘s a whole legion of
devils seen sometimes on that reef—sprawled about, or darting in and out of some kind of
caves near the top. It‘s a rugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end
of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it.
―That is, sailors that didn‘t hail from Innsmouth. One of the things they had against old
Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at night when the tide was
right. Maybe he did, for I dare say the rock formation was interesting, and it‘s just barely
possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it; but there was talk of his dealing
with daemons there. Fact is, I guess on the whole it was really the Captain that gave the bad
reputation to the reef.
―That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks in Innsmouth was carried
off. They never did quite figure out what the trouble was, but it was probably some foreign
kind of disease brought from China or somewhere by the shipping. It surely was bad
enough—there was riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that I don‘t believe ever got
outside of town—and it left the place in awful shape. Never came back—there can‘t be more‘n
300 or 400 people living there now.
―But the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice—and I don‘t say I‘m
blaming those that hold it. I hate those Innsmouth folks myself, and I wouldn‘t care to go to
their town. I s‘pose you know—though I can see you‘re a Westerner by your talk—what a lot
our New England ships used to have to do with queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas,
and everywhere else, and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with ‘em.
You‘ve probably heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chinese wife, and maybe
you know there‘s still a bunch of Fiji Islanders somewhere around Cape Cod.
―Well, there must be something like that back of the Innsmouth people. The place always was
badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks, and we can‘t be sure about
the ins and outs of the matter; but it‘s pretty clear that old Captain Marsh must have brought
home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the
twenties and thirties. There certainly is a strange kind of streak in the Innsmouth folks today—
I don‘t know how to explain it, but it sort of makes you crawl. You‘ll notice a little in Sargent if
you take his bus. Some of ‘em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy, stary eyes
that never seem to shut, and their skin ain‘t quite right. Rough and scabby, and the sides of
their necks are all shrivelled or creased up. Get bald, too, very young. The older fellows look
the worst—fact is, I don‘t believe I‘ve ever seen a very old chap of that kind. Guess they must
die of looking in the glass! Animals hate ‘em—they used to have lots of horse trouble before
autos came in.
―Nobody around here or in Arkham or Ipswich will have anything to do with ‘em, and they act
kind of offish themselves when they come to town or when anyone tries to fish on their
grounds. Queer how fish are always thick off Innsmouth Harbour when there ain‘t any
anywhere else around—but just try to fish there yourself and see how the folks chase you off!
Those people used to come here on the railroad—walking and taking the train at Rowley after
the branch was dropped—but now they use that bus.
―Yes, there‘s a hotel in Innsmouth—called the Gilman House—but I don‘t believe it can
amount to much. I wouldn‘t advise you to try it. Better stay over here and take the ten o‘clock
bus tomorrow morning; then you can get an evening bus there for Arkham at eight o‘clock.
There was a factory inspector who stopped at the Gilman a couple of years ago, and he had a
lot of unpleasant hints about the place. Seems they get a queer crowd there, for this fellow
heard voices in other rooms—though most of ‘em was empty—that gave him the shivers. It
was foreign talk, he thought, but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that
sometimes spoke. It sounded so unnatural—slopping-like, he said—that he didn‘t dare
undress and go to sleep. Just waited up and lit out the first thing in the morning. The talk went
on most all night.
―This fellow—Casey, his name was—had a lot to say about how the Innsmouth folks watched
him and seemed kind of on guard. He found the Marsh refinery a queer place—it‘s in an old
mill on the lower falls of the Manuxet. What he said tallied up with what I‘d heard. Books in
bad shape, and no clear account of any kind of dealings. You know it‘s always ben a kind of
mystery where the Marshes get the gold they refine. They‘ve never seemed to do much
buying in that line, but years ago they shipped out an enormous lot of ingots.
―Used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewellery that the sailors and refinery men
sometimes sold on the sly, or that was seen once or twice on some of the Marsh womenfolks.
People allowed maybe old Captain Obed traded for it in some heathen port, especially since
he was always ordering stacks of glass beads and trinkets such as seafaring men used to get
for native trade. Others thought and still think he‘d found an old pirate cache out on Devil
Reef. But here‘s a funny thing. The old Captain‘s ben dead these sixty years, and there ain‘t
ben a good-sized ship out of the place since the Civil War; but just the same the Marshes still
keep on buying a few of those native trade things—mostly glass and rubber gewgaws, they
tell me. Maybe the Innsmouth folks like ‘em to look at themselves—Gawd knows they‘ve
gotten to be about as bad as South Sea cannibals and Guinea savages.
―That plague of ‘46 must have taken off the best blood in the place. Anyway, they‘re a doubtful
lot now, and the Marshes and the other rich folks are as bad as any. As I told you, there
probably ain‘t more‘n 400 people in the whole town in spite of all the streets they say there
are. I guess they‘re what they call ‗white trash‘ down South—lawless and sly, and full of secret
doings. They get a lot of fish and lobsters and do exporting by truck. Queer how the fish
swarm right there and nowhere else.
―Nobody can ever keep track of these people, and state school officials and census men have
a devil of a time. You can bet that prying strangers ain‘t welcome around Innsmouth. I‘ve
heard personally of more‘n one business or government man that‘s disappeared there, and
there‘s loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at Danvers now. They must have fixed up
some awful scare for that fellow.
―That‘s why I wouldn‘t go at night if I was you. I‘ve never ben there and have no wish to go,
but I guess a daytime trip couldn‘t hurt you—even though the people hereabouts will advise
you not to make it. If you‘re just sightseeing, and looking for old-time stuff, Innsmouth ought to
be quite a place for you.‖
And so I spent part of that evening at the Newburyport Public Library looking up data about
Innsmouth. When I had tried to question the natives in the shops, the lunch room, the
garages, and the fire station, I had found them even harder to get started than the ticket-agent
had predicted; and realised that I could not spare the time to overcome their first instinctive
reticences. They had a kind of obscure suspiciousness, as if there were something amiss with
anyone too much interested in Innsmouth. At the Y.M.C.A., where I was stopping, the clerk
merely discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and the people at the library
shewed much the same attitude. Clearly, in the eyes of the educated, Innsmouth was merely
an exaggerated case of civic degeneration.
The Essex County histories on the library shelves had very little to say, except that the town
was founded in 1643, noted for shipbuilding before the Revolution, a seat of great marine
prosperity in the early nineteenth century, and later a minor factory centre using the Manuxet
as power. The epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated, as if they formed a
discredit to the county.
References to decline were few, though the significance of the later record was unmistakable.
After the Civil War all industrial life was confined to the Marsh Refining Company, and the
marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the
eternal fishing. That fishing paid less and less as the price of the commodity fell and large-
scale corporations offered competition, but there was never a dearth of fish around Innsmouth
Harbour. Foreigners seldom settled there, and there was some discreetly veiled evidence that
a number of Poles and Portuguese who had tried it had been scattered in a peculiarly drastic
fashion.
Most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewellery vaguely associated
with Innsmouth. It had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little, for
mention was made of specimens in the museum of Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in
the display room of the Newburyport Historical Society. The fragmentary descriptions of these
things were bald and prosaic, but they hinted to me an undercurrent of persistent
strangeness. Something about them seemed so odd and provocative that I could not put them
out of my mind, and despite the relative lateness of the hour I resolved to see the local
sample—said to be a large, queerly proportioned thing evidently meant for a tiara—if it could
possibly be arranged.
The librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the Society, a Miss Anna Tilton,
who lived nearby, and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to
pilot me into the closed building, since the hour was not outrageously late. The collection was
a notable one indeed, but in my present mood I had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object
which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights.
It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange,
unearthly splendour of the alien, opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet
cushion. Even now I can hardly describe what I saw, though it was clearly enough a sort of
tiara, as the description had said. It was tall in front, and with a very large and curiously
irregular periphery, as if designed for a head of almost freakishly elliptical outline. The material
seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange
alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal. Its condition was almost perfect,
and one could have spent hours in studying the striking and puzzlingly untraditional designs—
some simply geometrical, and some plainly marine—chased or moulded in high relief on its
surface with a craftsmanship of incredible skill and grace.
The longer I looked, the more the thing fascinated me; and in this fascination there was a
curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for. At first I decided that it
was the queer other-worldly quality of the art which made me uneasy. All other art objects I
had ever seen either belonged to some known racial or national stream, or else were
consciously modernistic defiances of every recognised stream. This tiara was neither. It
clearly belonged to some settled technique of infinite maturity and perfection, yet that
technique was utterly remote from any—Eastern or Western, ancient or modern—which I had
ever heard of or seen exemplified. It was as if the workmanship were that of another planet.
However, I soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and perhaps equally potent source
residing in the pictorial and mathematical suggestions of the strange designs. The patterns all
hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the monotonously
aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister. Among these reliefs were fabulous
monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignity—half ichthyic and half batrachian in
suggestion—which one could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sense
of pseudo-memory, as if they called up some image from deep cells and tissues whose
retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral. At times I fancied that every
contour of these blasphemous fish-frogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of
unknown and inhuman evil.
In odd contrast to the tiara‘s aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by Miss Tilton. It
had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in State Street in 1873, by a drunken
Innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl. The Society had acquired it directly from
the pawnbroker, at once giving it a display worthy of its quality. It was labelled as of probable
East-Indian or Indo-Chinese provenance, though the attribution was frankly tentative.
Miss Tilton, comparing all possible hypotheses regarding its origin and its presence in New
England, was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by
old Captain Obed Marsh. This view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of
purchase at a high price which the Marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its
presence, and which they repeated to this day despite the Society‘s unvarying determination
not to sell.
As the good lady shewed me out of the building she made it clear that the pirate theory of the
Marsh fortune was a popular one among the intelligent people of the region. Her own attitude
toward shadowed Innsmouth—which she had never seen—was one of disgust at a
community slipping far down the cultural scale, and she assured me that the rumours of devil-
worship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and
engulfed all the orthodox churches.
It was called, she said, ―The Esoteric Order of Dagon‖, and was undoubtedly a debased,
quasi-pagan thing imported from the East a century before, at a time when the Innsmouth
fisheries seemed to be going barren. Its persistence among a simple people was quite natural
in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be
the greatest influence on the town, replacing Freemasonry altogether and taking up
headquarters in the old Masonic Hall on New Church Green.
All this, to the pious Miss Tilton, formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of
decay and desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive. To my architectural and
historical anticipations was now added an acute anthropological zeal, and I could scarcely
sleep in my small room at the ―Y‖ as the night wore away.
II.
Shortly before ten the next morning I stood with one small valise in front of Hammond‘s Drug
Store in old Market Square waiting for the Innsmouth bus. As the hour for its arrival drew near
I noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street, or to the Ideal Lunch
across the square. Evidently the ticket-agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local
people bore toward Innsmouth and its denizens. In a few moments a small motor-coach of
extreme decrepitude and dirty grey colour rattled down State Street, made a turn, and drew
up at the curb beside me. I felt immediately that it was the right one; a guess which the half-
illegible sign on the windshield—―Arkham-Innsmouth-Newb’port”—soon verified.
There were only three passengers—dark, unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat
youthful cast—and when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking
up State Street in a silent, almost furtive fashion. The driver also alighted, and I watched him
as he went into the drug store to make some purchase. This, I reflected, must be the Joe
Sargent mentioned by the ticket-agent; and even before I noticed any details there spread
over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained. It
suddenly struck me as very natural that the local people should not wish to ride on a bus
owned and driven by this man, or to visit any oftener than possible the habitat of such a man
and his kinsfolk.
When the driver came out of the store I looked at him more carefully and tried to determine
the source of my evil impression. He was a thin, stoop-shouldered man not much under six
feet tall, dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed grey golf cap. His age
was perhaps thirty-five, but the odd, deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem
older when one did not study his dull, expressionless face. He had a narrow head, bulging,
watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin, and
singularly undeveloped ears. His long, thick lip and coarse-pored, greyish cheeks seemed
almost beardless except for some sparse yellow hairs that straggled and curled in irregular
patches; and in places the surface seemed queerly irregular, as if peeling from some
cutaneous disease. His hands were large and heavily veined, and had a very unusual
greyish-blue tinge. The fingers were strikingly short in proportion to the rest of the structure,
and seemed to have a tendency to curl closely into the huge palm. As he walked toward the
bus I observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense.
The more I studied them the more I wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them.
A certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike. He was evidently given to working
or lounging around the fish docks, and carried with him much of their characteristic smell. Just
what foreign blood was in him I could not even guess. His oddities certainly did not look
Asiatic, Polynesian, Levantine, or negroid, yet I could see why the people found him alien. I
myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alienage.
I was sorry when I saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus. Somehow I did
not like the idea of riding alone with this driver. But as leaving time obviously approached I
conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and
murmuring the single word ―Innsmouth‖. He looked curiously at me for a second as he
returned forty cents change without speaking. I took a seat far behind him, but on the same
side of the bus, since I wished to watch the shore during the journey.
At length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk, and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings
of State Street amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust. Glancing at the people on the
sidewalks, I thought I detected in them a curious wish to avoid looking at the bus—or at least
a wish to avoid seeming to look at it. Then we turned to the left into High Street, where the
going was smoother; flying by stately old mansions of the early republic and still older colonial
farmhouses, passing the Lower Green and Parker River, and finally emerging into a long,
monotonous stretch of open shore country.
The day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand, sedge-grass, and stunted
shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded. Out the window I could see the
blue water and the sandy line of Plum Island, and we presently drew very near the beach as
our narrow road veered off from the main highway to Rowley and Ipswich. There were no
visible houses, and I could tell by the state of the road that traffic was very light hereabouts.
The small, weather-worn telephone poles carried only two wires. Now and then we crossed
crude wooden bridges over tidal creeks that wound far inland and promoted the general
isolation of the region.
Once in a while I noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundation-walls above the drifting
sand, and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories I had read, that this was
once a fertile and thickly settled countryside. The change, it was said, came simultaneously
with the Innsmouth epidemic of 1846, and was thought by simple folk to have a dark
connexion with hidden forces of evil. Actually, it was caused by the unwise cutting of
woodlands near the shore, which robbed the soil of its best protection and opened the way for
waves of wind-blown sand.
At last we lost sight of Plum Island and saw the vast expanse of the open Atlantic on our left.
Our narrow course began to climb steeply, and I felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at
the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky. It was as if the bus were about
to keep on in its ascent, leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown
arcana of upper air and cryptical sky. The smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and
the silent driver‘s bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful. As I
looked at him I saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face, having only
a few straggling yellow strands upon a grey scabrous surface.
Then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the Manuxet joins
the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in Kingsport Head and veer off toward
Cape Ann. On the far, misty horizon I could just make out the dizzy profile of the Head, topped
by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my
attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me. I had, I realised, come face to
face with rumour-shadowed Innsmouth.
It was a town of wide extent and dense construction, yet one with a portentous dearth of
visible life. From the tangle of chimney-pots scarcely a wisp of smoke came, and the three tall
steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward horizon. One of them was
crumbling down at the top, and in that and another there were only black gaping holes where
clock-dials should have been. The vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables
conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay, and as we approached along the
now descending road I could see that many roofs had wholly caved in. There were some
large square Georgian houses, too, with hipped roofs, cupolas, and railed ―widow‘s walks‖.
These were mostly well back from the water, and one or two seemed to be in moderately
sound condition. Stretching inland from among them I saw the rusted, grass-grown line of the
abandoned railway, with leaning telegraph-poles now devoid of wires, and the half-obscured
lines of the old carriage roads to Rowley and Ipswich.
The decay was worst close to the waterfront, though in its very midst I could spy the white
belfry of a fairly well-preserved brick structure which looked like a small factory. The harbour,
long clogged with sand, was enclosed by an ancient stone breakwater; on which I could begin
to discern the minute forms of a few seated fishermen, and at whose end were what looked
like the foundations of a bygone lighthouse. A sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier,
and upon it I saw a few decrepit cabins, moored dories, and scattered lobster-pots. The only
deep water seemed to be where the river poured out past the belfried structure and turned
southward to join the ocean at the breakwater‘s end.
Here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate
rottenness, those farthest south seeming the most decayed. And far out at sea, despite a high
tide, I glimpsed a long, black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of
odd latent malignancy. This, I knew, must be Devil Reef. As I looked, a subtle, curious sense
of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, I found this
overtone more disturbing than the primary impression.
We met no one on the road, but presently began to pass deserted farms in varying stages of
ruin. Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells
and dead fish lying about the littered yards. Once or twice I saw listless-looking people
working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below, and groups of
dirty, simian-visaged children playing around weed-grown doorsteps. Somehow these people
seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings, for almost every one had certain
peculiarities of face and motions which I instinctively disliked without being able to define or
comprehend them. For a second I thought this typical physique suggested some picture I had
seen, perhaps in a book, under circumstances of particular horror or melancholy; but this
pseudo-recollection passed very quickly.
As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the
unnatural stillness. The leaning, unpainted houses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road,
and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind. The panorama
ahead had contracted to a street scene, and in spots I could see where a cobblestone
pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed. All the houses were
apparently deserted, and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar
walls told of buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy
odour imaginable.
Soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on the left leading to shoreward
realms of unpaved squalor and decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed
grandeur. So far I had seen no people in the town, but there now came signs of a sparse
habitation—curtained windows here and there, and an occasional battered motor-car at the
curb. Pavement and sidewalks were increasingly well defined, and though most of the houses
were quite old—wood and brick structures of the early nineteenth century—they were
obviously kept fit for habitation. As an amateur antiquarian I almost lost my olfactory disgust
and my feeling of menace and repulsion amidst this rich, unaltered survival from the past.
But I was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly
disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with
churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre, and I was
looking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The structure‘s once white
paint was now grey and peeling, and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded
that I could only with difficulty make out the words ―Esoteric Order of Dagon‖. This, then, was
the former Masonic Hall now given over to a degraded cult. As I strained to decipher this
inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a cracked bell across the street,
and I quickly turned to look out the window on my side of the coach.
The sound came from a squat-towered stone church of manifestly later date than most of the
houses, built in a clumsy Gothic fashion and having a disproportionately high basement with
shuttered windows. Though the hands of its clock were missing on the side I glimpsed, I knew
that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven. Then suddenly all thoughts of time
were blotted out by an onrushing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which
had seized me before I knew what it really was. The door of the church basement was open,
revealing a rectangle of blackness inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed or seemed
to cross that dark rectangle; burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare
which was all the more maddening because analysis could not shew a single nightmarish
quality in it.
It was a living object—the first except the driver that I had seen since entering the compact
part of the town—and had I been in a steadier mood I would have found nothing whatever of
terror in it. Clearly, as I realised a moment later, it was the pastor; clad in some peculiar
vestments doubtless introduced since the Order of Dagon had modified the ritual of the local
churches. The thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied
the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate of the one
Miss Tilton had shewn me the previous evening. This, acting on my imagination, had supplied
namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it.
There was not, I soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that shuddering touch of
evil pseudo-memory. Was it not natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its
regimentals an unique type of head-dress made familiar to the community in some strange
way—perhaps as treasure-trove?
A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became visible on the
sidewalks—lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three. The lower floors of the crumbling
houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or
two as we rattled along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct, and
presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge ahead, spanned by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge
beyond which a large square opened out. As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both
sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down.
The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream
on my right and at least one downstream on my left. From this point the noise was quite
deafening. Then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on
the right-hand side in front of a tall, cupola-crowned building with remnants of yellow paint and
with a half-effaced sign proclaiming it to be the Gilman House.
I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby
hotel lobby. There was only one person in sight—an elderly man without what I had come to
call the ―Innsmouth look‖—and I decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered
me; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the
square, from which the bus had already gone, and studied the scene minutely and
appraisingly.
One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river; the other was a
semicircle of slant-roofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period, from which several streets
radiated away to the southeast, south, and southwest. Lamps were depressingly few and
small—all low-powered incandescents—and I was glad that my plans called for departure
before dark, even though I knew the moon would be bright. The buildings were all in fair
condition, and included perhaps a dozen shops in current operation; of which one was a
grocery of the First National chain, others a dismal restaurant, a drug store, and a wholesale
fish-dealer‘s office, and still another, at the eastern extremity of the square near the river, an
office of the town‘s only industry—the Marsh Refining Company. There were perhaps ten
people visible, and four or five automobiles and motor trucks stood scattered about. I did not
need to be told that this was the civic centre of Innsmouth. Eastward I could catch blue
glimpses of the harbour, against which rose the decaying remains of three once beautiful
Georgian steeples. And toward the shore on the opposite bank of the river I saw the white
belfry surmounting what I took to be the Marsh refinery.
For some reason or other I chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery, whose
personnel was not likely to be native to Innsmouth. I found a solitary boy of about seventeen
in charge, and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful
information. He seemed exceptionally eager to talk, and I soon gathered that he did not like
the place, its fishy smell, or its furtive people. A word with any outsider was a relief to him. He
hailed from Arkham, boarded with a family who came from Ipswich, and went back home
whenever he got a moment off. His family did not like him to work in Innsmouth, but the chain
had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job.
There was, he said, no public library or chamber of commerce in Innsmouth, but I could
probably find my way about. The street I had come down was Federal. West of that were the
fine old residence streets—Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and Adams—and east of it were
the shoreward slums. It was in these slums—along Main Street—that I would find the old
Georgian churches, but they were all long abandoned. It would be well not to make oneself
too conspicuous in such neighbourhoods—especially north of the river—since the people
were sullen and hostile. Some strangers had even disappeared.
Certain spots were almost forbidden territory, as he had learned at considerable cost. One
must not, for example, linger much around the Marsh refinery, or around any of the still used
churches, or around the pillared Order of Dagon Hall at New Church Green. Those churches
were very odd—all violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere, and
apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments. Their creeds were
heterodox and mysterious, involving hints of certain marvellous transformations leading to
bodily immortality—of a sort—on this earth. The youth‘s own pastor—Dr. Wallace of Asbury
M. E. Church in Arkham—had gravely urged him not to join any church in Innsmouth.
As for the Innsmouth people—the youth hardly knew what to make of them. They were as
furtive and seldom seen as animals that live in burrows, and one could hardly imagine how
they passed the time apart from their desultory fishing. Perhaps—judging from the quantities
of bootleg liquor they consumed—they lay for most of the daylight hours in an alcoholic
stupor. They seemed sullenly banded together in some sort of fellowship and understanding—
despising the world as if they had access to other and preferable spheres of entity. Their
appearance—especially those staring, unwinking eyes which one never saw shut—was
certainly shocking enough; and their voices were disgusting. It was awful to hear them
chanting in their churches at night, and especially during their main festivals or revivals, which
fell twice a year on April 30th and October 31st.
They were very fond of the water, and swam a great deal in both river and harbour. Swimming
races out to Devil Reef were very common, and everyone in sight seemed well able to share
in this arduous sport. When one came to think of it, it was generally only rather young people
who were seen about in public, and of these the oldest were apt to be the most tainted-
looking. When exceptions did occur, they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like
the old clerk at the hotel. One wondered what became of the bulk of the older folk, and
whether the ―Innsmouth look‖ were not a strange and insidious disease-phenomenon which
increased its hold as years advanced.
Only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and radical anatomical
changes in a single individual after maturity—changes involving osseous factors as basic as
the shape of the skull—but then, even this aspect was no more baffling and unheard-of than
the visible features of the malady as a whole. It would be hard, the youth implied, to form any
real conclusions regarding such a matter; since one never came to know the natives
personally no matter how long one might live in Innsmouth.
The youth was certain that many specimens even worse than the worst visible ones were
kept locked indoors in some places. People sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds.
The tottering waterfront hovels north of the river were reputedly connected by hidden tunnels,
being thus a veritable warren of unseen abnormalities. What kind of foreign blood—if any—
these beings had, it was impossible to tell. They sometimes kept certain especially repulsive
characters out of sight when government agents and others from the outside world came to
town.
It would be of no use, my informant said, to ask the natives anything about the place. The
only one who would talk was a very aged but normal-looking man who lived at the poorhouse
on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire
station. This hoary character, Zadok Allen, was ninety-six years old and somewhat touched in
the head, besides being the town drunkard. He was a strange, furtive creature who constantly
looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something, and when sober could not be persuaded to
talk at all with strangers. He was, however, unable to resist any offer of his favourite poison;
and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence.
After all, though, little useful data could be gained from him; since his stories were all insane,
incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his
own disordered fancy. Nobody ever believed him, but the natives did not like him to drink and
talk with strangers; and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him. It was probably
from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived.
Several non-native residents had reported monstrous glimpses from time to time, but between
old Zadok‘s tales and the malformed denizens it was no wonder such illusions were current.
None of the non-natives ever stayed out late at night, there being a widespread impression
that it was not wise to do so. Besides, the streets were loathsomely dark.
As for business—the abundance of fish was certainly almost uncanny, but the natives were
taking less and less advantage of it. Moreover, prices were falling and competition was
growing. Of course the town‘s real business was the refinery, whose commercial office was on
the square only a few doors east of where we stood. Old Man Marsh was never seen, but
sometimes went to the works in a closed, curtained car.
There were all sorts of rumours about how Marsh had come to look. He had once been a
great dandy, and people said he still wore the frock-coated finery of the Edwardian age,
curiously adapted to certain deformities. His sons had formerly conducted the office in the
square, but latterly they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leaving the brunt of
affairs to the younger generation. The sons and their sisters had come to look very queer,
especially the elder ones; and it was said that their health was failing.
One of the Marsh daughters was a repellent, reptilian-looking woman who wore an excess of
weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the strange tiara belonged.
My informant had noticed it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from some
secret hoard, either of pirates or of daemons. The clergymen—or priests, or whatever they
were called nowadays—also wore this kind of ornament as a head-dress; but one seldom
caught glimpses of them. Other specimens the youth had not seen, though many were
rumoured to exist around Innsmouth.
The Marshes, together with the other three gently bred families of the town—the Waites, the
Gilmans, and the Eliots—were all very retiring. They lived in immense houses along
Washington Street, and several were reputed to harbour in concealment certain living kinsfolk
whose personal aspect forbade public view, and whose deaths had been reported and
recorded.
Warning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my benefit a rough
but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town‘s salient features. After a moment‘s study I
felt sure that it would be of great help, and pocketed it with profuse thanks. Disliking the
dinginess of the single restaurant I had seen, I bought a fair supply of cheese crackers and
ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later on. My programme, I decided, would be to thread the
principal streets, talk with any non-natives I might encounter, and catch the eight o‘clock
coach for Arkham. The town, I could see, formed a significant and exaggerated example of
communal decay; but being no sociologist I would limit my serious observations to the field of
architecture.
Thus I began my systematic though half-bewildered tour of Innsmouth‘s narrow, shadow-
blighted ways. Crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls, I passed
close to the Marsh refinery, which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry. This building
stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which I took to
be the earliest civic centre, displaced after the Revolution by the present Town Square.
Re-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of utter desertion which
somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and
fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church.
Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down
unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which
leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those
windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront.
Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical
progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless
avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black,
brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start
up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse.
Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many brick and stone
warehouses still in excellent shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, save that there
were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a living thing did I see, except for the
scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater, and not a sound did I hear save the lapping of
the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was getting more and
more on my nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I picked my way back over the
tottering Water Street bridge. The Fish Street bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins.
North of the river there were traces of squalid life—active fish-packing houses in Water Street,
smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate
sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes—but I
seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one thing, the
people were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town; so that I was
several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which I could not quite place.
Undoubtedly the alien strain in the Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland—
unless, indeed, the ―Innsmouth look‖ were a disease rather than a blood strain, in which case
this district might be held to harbour the more advanced cases.
One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard. They ought
naturally to have come wholly from the visibly inhabited houses, yet in reality were often
strongest inside the most rigidly boarded-up facades. There were creakings, scurryings, and
hoarse doubtful noises; and I thought uncomfortably about the hidden tunnels suggested by
the grocery boy. Suddenly I found myself wondering what the voices of those denizens would
be like. I had heard no speech so far in this quarter, and was unaccountably anxious not to do
so.
Pausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous old churches at Main and Church
Streets, I hastened out of that vile waterfront slum. My next logical goal was New Church
Green, but somehow or other I could not bear to repass the church in whose basement I had
glimpsed the inexplicably frightening form of that strangely diademed priest or pastor.
Besides, the grocery youth had told me that the churches, as well as the Order of Dagon Hall,
were not advisable neighbourhoods for strangers.
Accordingly I kept north along Main to Martin, then turning inland, crossing Federal Street
safely north of the Green, and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern
Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and Adams Streets. Though these stately old avenues were ill-
surfaced and unkempt, their elm-shaded dignity had not entirely departed. Mansion after
mansion claimed my gaze, most of them decrepit and boarded up amidst neglected grounds,
but one or two in each street shewing signs of occupancy. In Washington Street there was a
row of four or five in excellent repair and with finely tended lawns and gardens. The most
sumptuous of these—with wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way to Lafayette
Street—I took to be the home of Old Man Marsh, the afflicted refinery owner.
In all these streets no living thing was visible, and I wondered at the complete absense of cats
and dogs from Innsmouth. Another thing which puzzled and disturbed me, even in some of
the best-preserved mansions, was the tightly shuttered condition of many third-story and attic
windows. Furtiveness and secretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and
death, and I could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by
sly, staring eyes that never shut.
I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left. Too well did I recall
the squat church from which those notes came. Following Washington Street toward the river,
I now faced a new zone of former industry and commerce; noting the ruins of a factory ahead,
and seeing others, with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge
beyond, up the gorge on my right.
The uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign, but I took the risk and
crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared. Furtive, shambling creatures
stared cryptically in my direction, and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously.
Innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable, and I turned down Paine Street toward the
Square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to Arkham before the still-distant
starting-time of that sinister bus.
It was then that I saw the tumbledown fire station on my left, and noticed the red-faced,
bushy-bearded, watery-eyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it
talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal-looking firemen. This, of course, must be
Zadok Allen, the half-crazed, liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old Innsmouth and its
shadow were so hideous and incredible.
III.
It must have been some imp of the perverse—or some sardonic pull from dark, hidden
sources—which made me change my plans as I did. I had long before resolved to limit my
observations to architecture alone, and I was even then hurrying toward the Square in an
effort to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and decay; but the sight of
old Zadok Allen set up new currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly.
I had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, and
incredible legends, and I had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking
to him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town‘s decay, with memories going back to
the early days of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount of reason could make me
resist. After all, the strangest and maddest of myths are often merely symbols or allegories
based upon truth—and old Zadok must have seen everything which went on around
Innsmouth for the last ninety years. Curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution, and in my
youthful egotism I fancied I might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused,
extravagant outpouring I would probably extract with the aid of raw whiskey.
I knew that I could not accost him then and there, for the firemen would surely notice and
object. Instead, I reflected, I would prepare by getting some bootleg liquor at a place where
the grocery boy had told me it was plentiful. Then I would loaf near the fire station in apparent
casualness, and fall in with old Zadok after he had started on one of his frequent rambles. The
youth said that he was very restless, seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour
or two at a time.
A quart bottle of whiskey was easily, though not cheaply, obtained in the rear of a dingy
variety-store just off the Square in Eliot Street. The dirty-looking fellow who waited on me had
a touch of the staring ―Innsmouth look‖, but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to
the custom of such convivial strangers—truckmen, gold-buyers, and the like—as were
occasionally in town.
Reëntering the Square I saw that luck was with me; for—shuffling out of Paine Street around
the corner of the Gilman House—I glimpsed nothing less than the tall, lean, tattered form of
old Zadok Allen himself. In accordance with my plan, I attracted his attention by brandishing
my newly purchased bottle; and soon realised that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me
as I turned into Waite Street on my way to the most deserted region I could think of.
I was steering my course by the map the grocery boy had prepared, and was aiming for the
wholly abandoned stretch of southern waterfront which I had previously visited. The only
people in sight there had been the fishermen on the distant breakwater; and by going a few
squares south I could get beyond the range of these, finding a pair of seats on some
abandoned wharf and being free to question old Zadok unobserved for an indefinite time.
Before I reached Main Street I could hear a faint and wheezy ―Hey, Mister!‖ behind me, and I
presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle.
I began putting out feelers as we walked along to Water Street and turned southward amidst
the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins, but found that the aged tongue did not
loosen as quickly as I had expected. At length I saw a grass-grown opening toward the sea
between crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length of an earth-and-masonry wharf
projecting beyond. Piles of moss-covered stones near the water promised tolerable seats,
and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north. Here,
I thought, was the ideal place for a long secret colloquy; so I guided my companion down the
lane and picked out spots to sit in among the mossy stones. The air of death and desertion
was ghoulish, and the smell of fish almost insufferable; but I was resolved to let nothing deter
me.
About four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight o‘clock coach for
Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler; meanwhile eating my own
frugal lunch. In my donations I was careful not to overshoot the mark, for I did not wish
Zadok‘s vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor. After an hour his furtive taciturnity shewed
signs of disappearing, but much to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about
Innsmouth and its shadow-haunted past. He would babble of current topics, revealing a wide
acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a sententious village
fashion.
Toward the end of the second hour I feared my quart of whiskey would not be enough to
produce results, and was wondering whether I had better leave old Zadok and go back for
more. Just then, however, chance made the opening which my questions had been unable to
make; and the wheezing ancient‘s rambling took a turn that caused me to lean forward and
listen alertly. My back was toward the fishy-smelling sea, but he was facing it, and something
or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of Devil Reef, then
shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves. The sight seemed to displease
him, for he began a series of weak curses which ended in a confidential whisper and a
knowing leer. He bent toward me, took hold of my coat lapel, and hissed out some hints that
could not be mistaken.
―Thar‘s whar it all begun—that cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts.
Gate o‘ hell—sheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundin‘-line kin tech. Ol‘ Cap‘n Obed done
it—him that faound aout more‘n was good fer him in the Saouth Sea islands.
―Everybody was in a bad way them days. Trade fallin‘ off, mills losin‘ business—even the new
ones—an‘ the best of our menfolks kilt a-privateerin‘ in the War of 1812 or lost with the Elizy
brig an‘ the Ranger snow—both of ‘em Gilman venters. Obed Marsh he had three ships
afloat—brigantine Columby, brig Hetty, an‘ barque Sumatry Queen. He was the only one as
kep‘ on with the East-Injy an‘ Pacific trade, though Esdras Martin‘s barkentine Malay Pride
made a venter as late as ‘twenty-eight.
―Never was nobody like Cap‘n Obed—old limb o‘ Satan! Heh, heh! I kin mind him a-tellin‘
abaout furren parts, an‘ callin‘ all the folks stupid fer goin‘ to Christian meetin‘ an‘ bearin‘ their
burdens meek an‘ lowly. Says they‘d orter git better gods like some o‘ the folks in the Injies—
gods as ud bring ‘em good fishin‘ in return for their sacrifices, an‘ ud reely answer folks‘s
prayers.
―Matt Eliot, his fust mate, talked a lot, too, only he was agin‘ folks‘s doin‘ any heathen things.
Told abaout an island east of Otaheité whar they was a lot o‘ stone ruins older‘n anybody
knew anything abaout, kind o‘ like them on Ponape, in the Carolines, but with carvin‘s of faces
that looked like the big statues on Easter Island. They was a little volcanic island near thar,
too, whar they was other ruins with diff‘rent carvin‘s—ruins all wore away like they‘d ben
under the sea onct, an‘ with picters of awful monsters all over ‘em.
―Wal, Sir, Matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch, an‘ sported
bracelets an‘ armlets an‘ head rigs made aout of a queer kind o‘ gold an‘ covered with picters
o‘ monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little island—sorter fish-like frogs or
frog-like fishes that was drawed in all kinds o‘ positions like they was human bein‘s. Nobody
cud git aout o‘ them whar they got all the stuff, an‘ all the other natives wondered haow they
managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickin‘s. Matt he got
to wonderin‘ too, an‘ so did Cap‘n Obed. Obed he notices, besides, that lots of the han‘some
young folks ud drop aout o‘ sight fer good from year to year, an‘ that they wa‘n‘t many old
folks araound. Also, he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer Kanakys.
―It took Obed to git the truth aout o‘ them heathen. I dun‘t know haow he done it, but he begun
by tradin‘ fer the gold-like things they wore. Ast ‘em whar they come from, an‘ ef they cud git
more, an‘ finally wormed the story aout o‘ the old chief—Walakea, they called him. Nobody
but Obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil, but the Cap‘n cud read folks like they was
books. Heh, heh! Nobody never believes me naow when I tell ‘em, an‘ I dun‘t s‘pose you will,
young feller—though come to look at ye, ye hev kind o‘ got them sharp-readin‘ eyes like Obed
had.‖
The old man‘s whisper grew fainter, and I found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere
portentousness of his intonation, even though I knew his tale could be nothing but drunken
phantasy.
―Wal, Sir, Obed he larnt that they‘s things on this arth as most folks never heerd abaout—an‘
wouldn‘t believe ef they did hear. It seems these Kanakys was sacrificin‘ heaps o‘ their young
men an‘ maidens to some kind o‘ god-things that lived under the sea, an‘ gittin‘ all kinds o‘
favour in return. They met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins, an‘ it seems them
awful picters o‘ frog-fish monsters was supposed to be picters o‘ these things. Mebbe they
was the kind o‘ critters as got all the mermaid stories an‘ sech started. They had all kinds o‘
cities on the sea-bottom, an‘ this island was heaved up from thar. Seems they was some of
the things alive in the stone buildin‘s when the island come up sudden to the surface. That‘s
haow the Kanakys got wind they was daown thar. Made sign-talk as soon as they got over
bein‘ skeert, an‘ pieced up a bargain afore long.
―Them things liked human sacrifices. Had had ‘em ages afore, but lost track o‘ the upper
world arter a time. What they done to the victims it ain‘t fer me to say, an‘ I guess Obed wa‘n‘t
none too sharp abaout askin‘. But it was all right with the heathens, because they‘d ben havin‘
a hard time an‘ was desp‘rate abaout everything. They give a sarten number o‘ young folks to
the sea-things twict every year—May-Eve an‘ Hallowe‘en—reg‘lar as cud be. Also give some
o‘ the carved knick-knacks they made. What the things agreed to give in return was plenty o‘
fish—they druv ‘em in from all over the sea—an‘ a few gold-like things naow an‘ then.
―Wal, as I says, the natives met the things on the little volcanic islet—goin‘ thar in canoes with
the sacrifices et cet‘ry, and bringin‘ back any of the gold-like jools as was comin‘ to ‘em. At fust
the things didn‘t never go onto the main island, but arter a time they come to want to. Seems
they hankered arter mixin‘ with the folks, an‘ havin‘ j‘int ceremonies on the big days—May-Eve
an‘ Hallowe‘en. Ye see, they was able to live both in an‘ aout o‘ water—what they call
amphibians, I guess. The Kanakys told ‘em as haow folks from the other islands might wanta
wipe ‘em aout ef they got wind o‘ their bein‘ thar, but they says they dun‘t keer much, because
they cud wipe aout the hull brood o‘ humans ef they was willin‘ to bother—that is, any as
didn‘t hev sarten signs sech as was used onct by the lost Old Ones, whoever they was. But
not wantin‘ to bother, they‘d lay low when anybody visited the island.
―When it come to matin‘ with them toad-lookin‘ fishes, the Kanakys kind o‘ balked, but finally
they larnt something as put a new face on the matter. Seems that human folks has got a kind
o‘ relation to sech water-beasts—that everything alive come aout o‘ the water onct, an‘ only
needs a little change to go back agin. Them things told the Kanakys that ef they mixed bloods
there‘d be children as ud look human at fust, but later turn more‘n more like the things, till
finally they‘d take to the water an‘ jine the main lot o‘ things daown thar. An‘ this is the
important part, young feller—them as turned into fish things an‘ went into the water wouldn’t
never die. Them things never died excep‘ they was kilt violent.
―Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was all full o‘ fish blood from
them deep-water things. When they got old an‘ begun to shew it, they was kep‘ hid until they
felt like takin‘ to the water an‘ quittin‘ the place. Some was more teched than others, an‘ some
never did change quite enough to take to the water; but mostly they turned aout jest the way
them things said. Them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was
nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they‘d usually
go daown under fer trial trips afore that. Folks as had took to the water gen‘rally come back a
good deal to visit, so‘s a man ud often be a-talkin‘ to his own five-times-great-grandfather,
who‘d left the dry land a couple o‘ hundred years or so afore.
―Everybody got aout o‘ the idee o‘ dyin‘—excep‘ in canoe wars with the other islanders, or as
sacrifices to the sea-gods daown below, or from snake-bite or plague or sharp gallopin‘
ailments or somethin‘ afore they cud take to the water—but simply looked forrad to a kind o‘
change that wa‘n‘t a bit horrible arter a while. They thought what they‘d got was well wuth all
they‘d had to give up—an‘ I guess Obed kind o‘ come to think the same hisself when he‘d
chewed over old Walakea‘s story a bit. Walakea, though, was one of the few as hadn‘t got
none of the fish blood—bein‘ of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands.
―Walakea he shewed Obed a lot o‘ rites an‘ incantations as had to do with the sea-things, an‘
let him see some o‘ the folks in the village as had changed a lot from human shape.
Somehaow or other, though, he never would let him see one of the reg‘lar things from right
aout o‘ the water. In the end he give him a funny kind o‘ thingumajig made aout o‘ lead or
something, that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they
might be a nest of ‘em. The idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o‘ prayers an‘ sech.
Walakea allaowed as the things was scattered all over the world, so‘s anybody that looked
abaout cud find a nest an‘ bring ‘em up ef they was wanted.
―Matt he didn‘t like this business at all, an‘ wanted Obed shud keep away from the island; but
the Cap‘n was sharp fer gain, an‘ faound he cud git them gold-like things so cheap it ud pay
him to make a specialty of ‘em. Things went on that way fer years, an‘ Obed got enough o‘
that gold-like stuff to make him start the refinery in Waite‘s old run-daown fullin‘ mill. He didn‘t
dass sell the pieces like they was, fer folks ud be all the time askin‘ questions. All the same
his crews ud git a piece an‘ dispose of it naow and then, even though they was swore to keep
quiet; an‘ he let his women-folks wear some o‘ the pieces as was more human-like than most.
―Wal, come abaout ‘thutty-eight—when I was seven year‘ old—Obed he faound the island
people all wiped aout between v‘yages. Seems the other islanders had got wind o‘ what was
goin‘ on, an‘ had took matters into their own hands. S‘pose they musta had, arter all, them old
magic signs as the sea-things says was the only things they was afeard of. No tellin‘ what any
o‘ them Kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the sea-bottom throws up some island with
ruins older‘n the deluge. Pious cusses, these was—they didn‘t leave nothin‘ standin‘ on either
the main island or the little volcanic islet excep‘ what parts of the ruins was too big to knock
daown. In some places they was little stones strewed abaout—like charms—with somethin‘
on ‘em like what ye call a swastika naowadays. Prob‘ly them was the Old Ones‘ signs. Folks
all wiped aout, no trace o‘ no gold-like things, an‘ none o‘ the nearby Kanakys ud breathe a
word abaout the matter. Wouldn‘t even admit they‘d ever ben any people on that island.
―That naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein‘ as his normal trade was doin‘ very poor. It hit the
whole of Innsmouth, too, because in seafarin‘ days what profited the master of a ship gen‘lly
profited the crew proportionate. Most o‘ the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind
o‘ sheep-like an‘ resigned, but they was in bad shape because the fishin‘ was peterin‘ aout an‘
the mills wa‘n‘t doin‘ none too well.
―Then‘s the time Obed he begun a-cursin‘ at the folks fer bein‘ dull sheep an‘ prayin‘ to a
Christian heaven as didn‘t help ‘em none. He told ‘em he‘d knowed of folks as prayed to gods
that give somethin‘ ye reely need, an‘ says ef a good bunch o‘ men ud stand by him, he cud
mebbe git a holt o‘ sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o‘ fish an‘ quite a bit o‘ gold. O‘ course
them as sarved on the Sumatry Queen an‘ seed the island knowed what he meant, an‘ wa‘n‘t
none too anxious to git clost to sea-things like they‘d heerd tell on, but them as didn‘t know
what ‘twas all abaout got kind o‘ swayed by what Obed had to say, an‘ begun to ast him what
he cud do to set ‘em on the way to the faith as ud bring ‘em results.‖
Here the old man faltered, mumbled, and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence;
glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant
black reef. When I spoke to him he did not answer, so I knew I would have to let him finish the
bottle. The insane yarn I was hearing interested me profoundly, for I fancied there was
contained within it a sort of crude allegory based upon the strangenesses of Innsmouth and
elaborated by an imagination at once creative and full of scraps of exotic legend. Not for a
moment did I believe that the tale had any really substantial foundation; but none the less the
account held a hint of genuine terror, if only because it brought in references to strange jewels
clearly akin to the malign tiara I had seen at Newburyport. Perhaps the ornaments had, after
all, come from some strange island; and possibly the wild stories were lies of the bygone
Obed himself rather than of this antique toper.
I handed Zadok the bottle, and he drained it to the last drop. It was curious how he could
stand so much whiskey, for not even a trace of thickness had come into his high, wheezy
voice. He licked the nose of the bottle and slipped it into his pocket, then beginning to nod
and whisper softly to himself. I bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter, and
thought I saw a sardonic smile behind the stained, bushy whiskers. Yes—he was really
forming words, and I could grasp a fair proportion of them.
―Poor Matt—Matt he allus was agin‘ it—tried to line up the folks on his side, an‘ had long talks
with the preachers—no use—they run the Congregational parson aout o‘ taown, an‘ the
Methodist feller quit—never did see Resolved Babcock, the Baptist parson, agin—Wrath o‘
Jehovy—I was a mighty little critter, but I heerd what I heerd an‘ seen what I seen—Dagon an‘
Ashtoreth—Belial an‘ Beëlzebub—Golden Caff an‘ the idols o‘ Canaan an‘ the Philistines—
Babylonish abominations—Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin—”
He stopped again, and from the look in his watery blue eyes I feared he was close to a stupor
after all. But when I gently shook his shoulder he turned on me with astonishing alertness and
snapped out some more obscure phrases.
―Dun‘t believe me, hey? Heh, heh, heh—then jest tell me, young feller, why Cap‘n Obed an‘
twenty odd other folks used to row aout to Devil Reef in the dead o‘ night an‘ chant things so
laoud ye cud hear ‘em all over taown when the wind was right? Tell me that, hey? An‘ tell me
why Obed was allus droppin‘ heavy things daown into the deep water t‘other side o‘ the reef
whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lower‘n ye kin saound? Tell me what he done with
that funny-shaped lead thingumajig as Walakea give him? Hey, boy? An‘ what did they all
haowl on May-Eve, an‘ agin the next Hallowe‘en? An‘ why‘d the new church parsons—fellers
as used to be sailors—wear them queer robes an‘ cover theirselves with them gold-like things
Obed brung? Hey?‖
The watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now, and the dirty white beard
bristled electrically. Old Zadok probably saw me shrink back, for he had begun to cackle evilly.
―Heh, heh, heh, heh! Beginnin‘ to see, hey? Mebbe ye‘d like to a ben me in them days, when I
seed things at night aout to sea from the cupalo top o‘ my haouse. Oh, I kin tell ye, little
pitchers hev big ears, an‘ I wa‘n‘t missin‘ nothin‘ o‘ what was gossiped abaout Cap‘n Obed an‘
the folks aout to the reef! Heh, heh, heh! Haow abaout the night I took my pa‘s ship‘s glass up
to the cupalo an‘ seed the reef a-bristlin‘ thick with shapes that dove off quick soon‘s the moon
riz? Obed an‘ the folks was in a dory, but them shapes dove off the far side into the deep
water an‘ never come up. . . . Haow‘d ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo a-
watchin‘ shapes as wa’n’t human shapes? . . . Hey? . . . Heh, heh, heh, heh. . . .‖
The old man was getting hysterical, and I began to shiver with a nameless alarm. He laid a
gnarled claw on my shoulder, and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of
mirth.
―S‘pose one night ye seed somethin‘ heavy heaved offen Obed‘s dory beyond the reef, an‘
then larned nex‘ day a young feller was missin‘ from home? Hey? Did anybody ever see hide
or hair o‘ Hiram Gilman agin? Did they? An‘ Nick Pierce, an‘ Luelly Waite, an‘ Adoniram
Saouthwick, an‘ Henry Garrison? Hey? Heh, heh, heh, heh. . . . Shapes talkin‘ sign language
with their hands . . . them as had reel hands. . . .
―Wal, Sir, that was the time Obed begun to git on his feet agin. Folks see his three darters a-
wearin‘ gold-like things as nobody‘d never see on ‘em afore, an‘ smoke started comin‘ aout o‘
the refin‘ry chimbly. Other folks were prosp‘rin‘, too—fish begun to swarm into the harbour fit
to kill, an‘ heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to Newb‘ryport, Arkham,
an‘ Boston. ‘Twas then Obed got the ol‘ branch railrud put through. Some Kingsport fishermen
heerd abaout the ketch an‘ come up in sloops, but they was all lost. Nobody never see ‘em
agin. An‘ jest then our folks organised the Esoteric Order o‘ Dagon, an‘ bought Masonic Hall
offen Calvary Commandery for it . . . heh, heh, heh! Matt Eliot was a Mason an‘ agin‘ the
sellin‘, but he dropped aout o‘ sight jest then.
―Remember, I ain‘t sayin‘ Obed was set on hevin‘ things jest like they was on that Kanaky isle.
I dun‘t think he aimed at fust to do no mixin‘, nor raise no younguns to take to the water an‘
turn into fishes with eternal life. He wanted them gold things, an‘ was willin‘ to pay heavy, an‘ I
guess the others was satisfied fer a while. . . .
―Come in ‘forty-six the taown done some lookin‘ an‘ thinkin‘ fer itself. Too many folks missin‘—
too much wild preachin‘ at meetin‘ of a Sunday—too much talk abaout that reef. I guess I
done a bit by tellin‘ Selectman Mowry what I see from the cupalo. They was a party one night
as follered Obed‘s craowd aout to the reef, an‘ I heerd shots betwixt the dories. Nex‘ day
Obed an‘ thutty-two others was in gaol, with everbody a-wonderin‘ jest what was afoot an‘ jest
what charge agin‘ ‘em cud be got to holt. God, ef anybody‘d look‘d ahead . . . a couple o‘
weeks later, when nothin‘ had ben throwed into the sea fer that long. . . .‖
Zadok was shewing signs of fright and exhaustion, and I let him keep silence for a while,
though glancing apprehensively at my watch. The tide had turned and was coming in now,
and the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him. I was glad of that tide, for at high water
the fishy smell might not be so bad. Again I strained to catch his whispers.
―That awful night . . . I seed ‘em . . . I was up in the cupalo . . . hordes of ‘em . . . swarms of
‘em . . . all over the reef an‘ swimmin‘ up the harbour into the Manuxet. . . . God, what
happened in the streets of Innsmouth that night . . . they rattled our door, but pa wouldn‘t open
. . . then he clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find Selectman Mowry an‘ see
what he cud do. . . . Maounds o‘ the dead an‘ the dyin‘ . . . shots an‘ screams . . . shaoutin‘ in
Ol‘ Squar an‘ Taown Squar an‘ New Church Green . . . gaol throwed open . . . proclamation . .
. treason . . . called it the plague when folks come in an‘ faound haff our people missin‘ . . .
nobody left but them as ud jine in with Obed an‘ them things or else keep quiet . . . never
heerd o‘ my pa no more. . . .‖
The old man was panting, and perspiring profusely. His grip on my shoulder tightened.
―Everything cleaned up in the mornin‘—but they was traces. . . . Obed he kinder takes charge
an‘ says things is goin‘ to be changed . . . others’ll worship with us at meetin‘-time, an‘ sarten
haouses hez got to entertain guests . . . they wanted to mix like they done with the Kanakys,
an‘ he fer one didn‘t feel baound to stop ‘em. Far gone, was Obed . . . jest like a crazy man on
the subjeck. He says they brung us fish an‘ treasure, an‘ shud hev what they hankered arter. .
. .
―Nothin‘ was to be diff‘runt on the aoutside, only we was to keep shy o‘ strangers ef we
knowed what was good fer us. We all hed to take the Oath o‘ Dagon, an‘ later on they was
secon‘ an‘ third Oaths that some on us took. Them as ud help special, ud git special
rewards—gold an‘ sech— No use balkin‘, fer they was millions of ‘em daown thar. They‘d
ruther not start risin‘ an‘ wipin‘ aout humankind, but ef they was gave away an‘ forced to, they
cud do a lot toward jest that. We didn‘t hev them old charms to cut ‘em off like folks in the
Saouth Sea did, an‘ them Kanakys wudn‘t never give away their secrets.
―Yield up enough sacrifices an‘ savage knick-knacks an‘ harbourage in the taown when they
wanted it, an‘ they‘d let well enough alone. Wudn‘t bother no strangers as might bear tales
aoutside—that is, withaout they got pryin‘. All in the band of the faithful—Order o‘ Dagon—an‘
the children shud never die, but go back to the Mother Hydra an‘ Father Dagon what we all
come from onct—Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah-nagl
fhtagn—”
Old Zadok was fast lapsing into stark raving, and I held my breath. Poor old soul—to what
pitiful depths of hallucination had his liquor, plus his hatred of the decay, alienage, and
disease around him, brought that fertile, imaginative brain! He began to moan now, and tears
were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the depths of his beard.
―God, what I seen senct I was fifteen year‘ old—Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin!—the folks as
was missin‘, an‘ them as kilt theirselves—them as told things in Arkham or Ipswich or sech
places was all called crazy, like you‘re a-callin‘ me right naow—but God, what I seen— They‘d
a kilt me long ago fer what I know, only I‘d took the fust an‘ secon‘ Oaths o‘ Dagon offen
Obed, so was pertected unlessen a jury of ‘em proved I told things knowin‘ an‘ delib‘rit . . . but
I wudn‘t take the third Oath—I‘d a died ruther‘n take that—
―It got wuss araound Civil War time, when children born senct ’forty-six begun to grow up—
some of ‘em, that is. I was afeard—never did no pryin‘ arter that awful night, an‘ never see
one of—them—clost to in all my life. That is, never no full-blooded one. I went to the war, an‘
ef I‘d a had any guts or sense I‘d a never come back, but settled away from here. But folks
wrote me things wa‘n‘t so bad. That, I s‘pose, was because gov‘munt draft men was in taown
arter ‘sixty-three. Arter the war it was jest as bad agin. People begun to fall off—mills an‘
shops shet daown—shippin‘ stopped an‘ the harbour choked up—railrud give up—but they . .
. they never stopped swimmin‘ in an‘ aout o‘ the river from that cursed reef o‘ Satan—an‘ more
an‘ more attic winders got a-boarded up, an‘ more an‘ more noises was heerd in haouses as
wa‘n‘t s‘posed to hev nobody in ‘em. . . .
―Folks aoutside hev their stories abaout us—s‘pose you‘ve heerd a plenty on ‘em, seein‘ what
questions ye ast—stories abaout things they‘ve seed naow an‘ then, an‘ abaout that queer
joolry as still comes in from somewhars an‘ ain‘t quite all melted up—but nothin‘ never gits
def‘nite. Nobody‘ll believe nothin‘. They call them gold-like things pirate loot, an‘ allaow the
Innsmouth folks hez furren blood or is distempered or somethin‘. Besides, them that lives
here shoo off as many strangers as they kin, an‘ encourage the rest not to git very cur‘ous,
specially raound night time. Beasts balk at the critters—hosses wuss‘n mules—but when they
got autos that was all right.
―In ‘forty-six Cap‘n Obed took a second wife that nobody in the taown never see—some says
he didn‘t want to, but was made to by them as he‘d called in—had three children by her—two
as disappeared young, but one gal as looked like anybody else an‘ was eddicated in Europe.
Obed finally got her married off by a trick to an Arkham feller as didn‘t suspect nothin‘. But
nobody aoutside‘ll hev nothin‘ to do with Innsmouth folks naow. Barnabas Marsh that runs the
refin‘ry naow is Obed‘s grandson by his fust wife—son of Onesiphorus, his eldest son, but his
mother was another o’ them as wa’n’t never seed aoutdoors.
―Right naow Barnabas is abaout changed. Can‘t shet his eyes no more, an‘ is all aout o‘
shape. They say he still wears clothes, but he‘ll take to the water soon. Mebbe he‘s tried it
already—they do sometimes go daown fer little spells afore they go fer good. Ain‘t ben seed
abaout in public fer nigh on ten year‘. Dun‘t know haow his poor wife kin feel—she come from
Ipswich, an‘ they nigh lynched Barnabas when he courted her fifty odd year‘ ago. Obed he
died in ‘seventy-eight, an‘ all the next gen‘ration is gone naow—the fust wife‘s children dead,
an‘ the rest . . . God knows. . . .‖
The sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent, and little by little it seemed to change
the old man‘s mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear. He would pause now and then
to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the reef, and despite the wild
absurdity of his tale, I could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness. Zadok
now grew shriller, and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech.
―Hey, yew, why dun‘t ye say somethin‘? Haow‘d ye like to be livin‘ in a taown like this, with
everything a-rottin‘ an‘ a-dyin‘, an‘ boarded-up monsters crawlin‘ an‘ bleatin‘ an‘ barkin‘ an‘
hoppin‘ araoun‘ black cellars an‘ attics every way ye turn? Hey? Haow‘d ye like to hear the
haowlin‘ night arter night from the churches an‘ Order o‘ Dagon Hall, an’ know what’s doin’
part o’ the haowlin’? Haow‘d ye like to hear what comes from that awful reef every May-Eve
an‘ Hallowmass? Hey? Think the old man‘s crazy, eh? Wal, Sir, let me tell ye that ain’t the
wust!”
Zadok was really screaming now, and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than I
care to own.
―Curse ye, dun‘t set thar a-starin‘ at me with them eyes—I tell Obed Marsh he‘s in hell, an‘ hez
got to stay thar! Heh, heh . . . in hell, I says! Can‘t git me—I hain‘t done nothin‘ nor told
nobody nothin‘—
―Oh, you, young feller? Wal, even ef I hain‘t told nobody nothin‘ yet, I‘m a-goin‘ to naow! You
jest set still an‘ listen to me, boy—this is what I ain‘t never told nobody. . . . I says I didn‘t do
no pryin‘ arter that night—but I faound things aout jest the same!
―Yew want to know what the reel horror is, hey? Wal, it‘s this—it ain‘t what them fish devils
hez done, but what they’re a-goin’ to do! They‘re a-bringin‘ things up aout o‘ whar they come
from into the taown—ben doin‘ it fer years, an‘ slackenin‘ up lately. Them haouses north o‘ the
river betwixt Water an‘ Main Streets is full of ‘em—them devils an’ what they brung—an‘ when
they git ready. . . . I say, when they git ready . . . ever hear tell of a shoggoth? . . .
―Hey, d‘ye hear me? I tell ye I know what them things be—I seen ’em one night when . . .
EH—AHHHH—AH! E‘YAAHHHH. . . .‖
The hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old man‘s shriek almost made me
faint. His eyes, looking past me toward the malodorous sea, were positively starting from his
head; while his face was a mask of fear worthy of Greek tragedy. His bony claw dug
monstrously into my shoulder, and he made no motion as I turned my head to look at
whatever he had glimpsed.
There was nothing that I could see. Only the incoming tide, with perhaps one set of ripples
more local than the long-flung line of breakers. But now Zadok was shaking me, and I turned
back to watch the melting of that fear-frozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and
mumbling gums. Presently his voice came back—albeit as a trembling whisper.
―Git aout o’ here! Git aout o‘ here! They seen us—git aout fer your life! Dun‘t wait fer nothin‘—
they know naow— Run fer it—quick—aout o’ this taown—‖
Another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf, and
changed the mad ancient‘s whisper to another inhuman and blood-curdling scream.
―E—YAAHHHH! . . . YHAAAAAAA! . . .‖
Before I could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and
dashed wildly inland toward the street, reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall.
I glanced back at the sea, but there was nothing there. And when I reached Water Street and
looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of Zadok Allen.
IV.
I can hardly describe the mood in which I was left by this harrowing episode—an episode at
once mad and pitiful, grotesque and terrifying. The grocery boy had prepared me for it, yet the
reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed. Puerile though the story was, old
Zadok‘s insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which
joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow.
Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I wished to
put it out of my head. The hour had grown perilously late—my watch said 7:15, and the
Arkham bus left Town Square at eight—so I tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical
a cast as possible, meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs
and leaning houses toward the hotel where I had checked my valise and would find my bus.
Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit chimneys an air
of mystic loveliness and peace, I could not help glancing over my shoulder now and then. I
would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and
wished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinister-looking fellow
Sargent. Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for there were architectural details worth viewing
at every silent corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a half-
hour.
Studying the grocery youth‘s map and seeking a route I had not traversed before, I chose
Marsh Street instead of State for my approach to Town Square. Near the corner of Fall Street I
began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers, and when I finally reached the Square I
saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the Gilman House. It
seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise
in the lobby, and I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow-
passengers on the coach.
The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-
looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent
threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers—
the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that morning—shambled to the
sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have
sworn was not English. I boarded the empty coach and took the same seat I had taken
before, but was hardly settled before Sargent reappeared and began mumbling in a throaty
voice of peculiar repulsiveness.
I was, it appeared, in very bad luck. There had been something wrong with the engine,
despite the excellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could not complete the
journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired that night, nor was there any other
way of getting transportation out of Innsmouth, either to Arkham or elsewhere. Sargent was
sorry, but I would have to stop over at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make the price
easy for me, but there was nothing else to do. Almost dazed by this sudden obstacle, and
violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the bus and
re-entered the hotel lobby; where the sullen, queer-looking night clerk told me I could have
Room 428 on next the top floor—large, but without running water—for a dollar.
Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the register, paid my dollar, let
the clerk take my valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights of
stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life. My room, a dismal rear one
with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise
hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward-
stretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond. At the end of the corridor was a
bathroom—a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and
musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures.
It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and looked around for a dinner of some sort;
noticing as I did so the strange glances I received from the unwholesome loafers. Since the
grocery was closed, I was forced to patronise the restaurant I had shunned before; a stooped,
narrow-headed man with staring, unwinking eyes, and a flat-nosed wench with unbelievably
thick, clumsy hands being in attendance. The service was of the counter type, and it relieved
me to find that much was evidently served from cans and packages. A bowl of vegetable soup
with crackers was enough for me, and I soon headed back for my cheerless room at the
Gilman; getting an evening paper and a flyspecked magazine from the evil-visaged clerk at
the rickety stand beside his desk.
As twilight deepened I turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap, iron-framed bed,
and tried as best I could to continue the reading I had begun. I felt it advisable to keep my
mind wholesomely occupied, for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this
ancient, blight-shadowed town while I was still within its borders. The insane yarn I had heard
from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams, and I felt I must keep the
image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination.
Also, I must not dwell on what that factory inspector had told the Newburyport ticket-agent
about the Gilman House and the voices of its nocturnal tenants—not on that, nor on the face
beneath the tiara in the black church doorway; the face for whose horror my conscious mind
could not account. It would perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing
topics had the room not been so gruesomely musty. As it was, the lethal mustiness blended
hideously with the town‘s general fishy odour and persistently focussed one‘s fancy on death
and decay.
Another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room. One had
been there, as marks clearly shewed, but there were signs of recent removal. No doubt it had
become out of order, like so many other things in this decrepit edifice. In my nervousness I
looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothes-press which seemed to be of the same
size, judging from the marks, as the one formerly on the door. To gain a partial relief from the
general tension I busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid
of a handy three-in-one device including a screw-driver which I kept on my key-ring. The bolt
fitted perfectly, and I was somewhat relieved when I knew that I could shoot it firmly upon
retiring. Not that I had any real apprehension of its need, but that any symbol of security was
welcome in an environment of this kind. There were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to
connecting rooms, and these I proceeded to fasten.
I did not undress, but decided to read till I was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat,
collar, and shoes off. Taking a pocket flashlight from my valise, I placed it in my trousers, so
that I could read my watch if I woke up later in the dark. Drowsiness, however, did not come;
and when I stopped to analyse my thoughts I found to my disquiet that I was really
unconsciously listening for something—listening for something which I dreaded but could not
name. That inspector‘s story must have worked on my imagination more deeply than I had
suspected. Again I tried to read, but found that I made no progress.
After a time I seemed to hear the stairs and corridors creak at intervals as if with footsteps,
and wondered if the other rooms were beginning to fill up. There were no voices, however,
and it struck me that there was something subtly furtive about the creaking. I did not like it,
and debated whether I had better try to sleep at all. This town had some queer people, and
there had undoubtedly been several disappearances. Was this one of those inns where
travellers were slain for their money? Surely I had no look of excessive prosperity. Or were
the townsfolk really so resentful about curious visitors? Had my obvious sightseeing, with its
frequent map-consultations, aroused unfavourable notice? It occurred to me that I must be in
a highly nervous state to let a few random creakings set me off speculating in this fashion—
but I regretted none the less that I was unarmed.
At length, feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it, I bolted the newly outfitted
hall door, turned off the light, and threw myself down on the hard, uneven bed—coat, collar,
shoes, and all. In the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified, and a flood of
doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me. I was sorry I had put out the light, yet was too
tired to rise and turn it on again. Then, after a long, dreary interval, and prefaced by a fresh
creaking of stairs and corridor, there came that soft, damnably unmistakable sound which
seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions. Without the least shadow of a doubt,
the lock on my hall door was being tried—cautiously, furtively, tentatively—with a key.
My sensations upon recognising this sign of actual peril were perhaps less rather than more
tumultuous because of my previous vague fears. I had been, albeit without definite reason,
instinctively on my guard—and that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever
it might turn out to be. Nevertheless the change in the menace from vague premonition to
immediate reality was a profound shock, and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow. It
never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake. Malign purpose was all
I could think of, and I kept deathly quiet, awaiting the would-be intruder‘s next move.
After a time the cautious rattling ceased, and I heard the room to the north entered with a
pass-key. Then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried. The bolt held, of
course, and I heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room. After a moment there came
another soft rattling, and I knew that the room to the south of me was being entered. Again a
furtive trying of a bolted connecting door, and again a receding creaking. This time the
creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the
bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time, as the
future would shew.
The readiness with which I fell into a plan of action proves that I must have been
subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours.
From the first I felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger not to be met or dealt with, but
only to be fled from as precipitately as possible. The one thing to do was to get out of that
hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through some channel other than the front stairs and
lobby.
Rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch, I sought to light the bulb over my bed in
order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift, valiseless flight. Nothing, however,
happened; and I saw that the power had been cut off. Clearly, some cryptic, evil movement
was afoot on a large scale—just what, I could not say. As I stood pondering with my hand on
the now useless switch I heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I could
barely distinguish voices in conversation. A moment later I felt less sure that the deeper
sounds were voices, since the apparent hoarse barkings and loose-syllabled croakings bore
so little resemblance to recognised human speech. Then I thought with renewed force of what
the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building.
Having filled my pockets with the flashlight‘s aid, I put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to
consider chances of descent. Despite the state‘s safety regulations there was no fire escape
on this side of the hotel, and I saw that my windows commanded only a sheer three-story
drop to the cobbled courtyard. On the right and left, however, some ancient brick business
blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from
my fourth-story level. To reach either of these lines of buildings I would have to be in a room
two doors from my own—in one case on the north and in the other case on the south—and
my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances I had of making the transfer.
I could not, I decided, risk an emergence into the corridor; where my footsteps would surely
be heard, and where the difficulties of entering the desired room would be insuperable. My
progress, if it was to be made at all, would have to be through the less solidly built connecting
doors of the rooms; the locks and bolts of which I would have to force violently, using my
shoulder as a battering-ram whenever they were set against me. This, I thought, would be
possible owing to the rickety nature of the house and its fixtures; but I realised I could not do it
noiselessly. I would have to count on sheer speed, and the chance of getting to a window
before any hostile forces became coördinated enough to open the right door toward me with a
pass-key. My own outer door I reinforced by pushing the bureau against it—little by little, in
order to make a minimum of sound.
I perceived that my chances were very slender, and was fully prepared for any calamity. Even
getting to another roof would not solve the problem, for there would then remain the task of
reaching the ground and escaping from the town. One thing in my favour was the deserted
and ruinous state of the abutting buildings, and the number of skylights gaping blackly open in
each row.
Gathering from the grocery boy‘s map that the best route out of town was southward, I
glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room. It was designed to open in
my direction, hence I saw—after drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in place—it was
not a favourable one for forcing. Accordingly abandoning it as a route, I cautiously moved the
bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room.
The door on the north was hung to open away from me, and this—though a test proved it to
be locked or bolted from the other side—I knew must be my route. If I could gain the roofs of
the buildings in Paine Street and descend successfully to the ground level, I might perhaps
dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to Washington or Bates—or
else emerge in Paine and edge around southward into Washington. In any case, I would aim
to strike Washington somehow and get quickly out of the Town Square region. My preference
would be to avoid Paine, since the fire station there might be open all night.
As I thought of these things I looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs below me,
now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full. On the right the black gash of the
river-gorge clove the panorama; abandoned factories and railway station clinging barnacle-
like to its sides. Beyond it the rusted railway and the Rowley road led off through a flat,
marshy terrain dotted with islets of higher and dryer scrub-grown land. On the left the creek-
threaded countryside was nearer, the narrow road to Ipswich gleaming white in the moonlight.
I could not see from my side of the hotel the southward route toward Arkham which I had
determined to take.
I was irresolutely speculating on when I had better attack the northward door, and on how I
could least audibly manage it, when I noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place
to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs. A wavering flicker of light shewed through my
transom, and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load. Muffled
sounds of possible vocal origin approached, and at length a firm knock came at my outer
door.
For a moment I simply held my breath and waited. Eternities seemed to elapse, and the
nauseous fishy odour of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly. Then
the knocking was repeated—continuously, and with growing insistence. I knew that the time
for action had come, and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door, bracing
myself for the task of battering it open. The knocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its
volume would cover the sound of my efforts. At last beginning my attempt, I lunged again and
again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder, heedless of shock or pain. The door resisted
even more than I had expected, but I did not give in. And all the while the clamour at the outer
door increased.
Finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that I knew those outside must have
heard. Instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering, while keys sounded
ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me. Rushing through the newly
opened connexion, I succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be
turned; but even as I did so I heard the hall door of the third room—the one from whose
window I had hoped to reach the roof below—being tried with a pass-key.
For an instant I felt absolute despair, since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress
seemed complete. A wave of almost abnormal horror swept over me, and invested with a
terrible but unexplainable singularity the flashlight-glimpsed dust prints made by the intruder
who had lately tried my door from this room. Then, with a dazed automatism which persisted
despite hopelessness, I made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of
pushing at it in an effort to get through and—granting that fastenings might be as
providentially intact as in this second room—bolt the hall door beyond before the lock could
be turned from outside.
Sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprieve—for the connecting door before me was not
only unlocked but actually ajar. In a second I was through, and had my right knee and
shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward. My pressure took the opener
off guard, for the thing shut as I pushed, so that I could slip the well-conditioned bolt as I had
done with the other door. As I gained this respite I heard the battering at the two other doors
abate, while a confused clatter came from the connecting door I had shielded with the
bedstead. Evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were
massing in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass-key sounded in the next door to
the north, and I knew that a nearer peril was at hand.
The northward connecting door was wide open, but there was no time to think about checking
the already turning lock in the hall. All I could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting
door, as well as its mate on the opposite side—pushing a bedstead against the one and a
bureau against the other, and moving a washstand in front of the hall door. I must, I saw, trust
to such makeshift barriers to shield me till I could get out the window and on the roof of the
Paine Street block. But even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from
the immediate weakness of my defences. I was shuddering because not one of my pursuers,
despite some hideous pantings, gruntings, and subdued barkings at odd intervals, was
uttering an unmuffled or intelligible vocal sound.
As I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I heard a frightful scurrying along the
corridor toward the room north of me, and perceived that the southward battering had ceased.
Plainly, most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door
which they knew must open directly on me. Outside, the moon played on the ridgepole of the
block below, and I saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep
surface on which I must land.
Surveying the conditions, I chose the more southerly of the two windows as my avenue of
escape; planning to land on the inner slope of the roof and make for the nearest skylight.
Once inside one of the decrepit brick structures I would have to reckon with pursuit; but I
hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard,
eventually getting to Washington Street and slipping out of town toward the south.
The clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific, and I saw that the weak
panelling was beginning to splinter. Obviously, the besiegers had brought some ponderous
object into play as a battering-ram. The bedstead, however, still held firm; so that I had at
least a faint chance of making good my escape. As I opened the window I noticed that it was
flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings, and also that there
was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior. Seeing a possible means of
avoiding the dangerous jump, I yanked at the hangings and brought them down, pole and all;
then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside. The
heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof, and I saw that the rings and catch would be
likely to bear my weight. So, climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder,
I left behind me forever the morbid and horror-infested fabric of the Gilman House.
I landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof, and succeeded in gaining the gaping
black skylight without a slip. Glancing up at the window I had left, I observed it was still dark,
though far across the crumbling chimneys to the north I could see lights ominously blazing in
the Order of Dagon Hall, the Baptist church, and the Congregational church which I recalled
so shiveringly. There had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below, and I hoped there
would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm. Flashing my pocket
lamp into the skylight, I saw that there were no steps down. The distance was slight, however,
so I clambered over the brink and dropped; striking a dusty floor littered with crumbling boxes
and barrels.
The place was ghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such impressions and made at once
for the staircase revealed by my flashlight—after a hasty glance at my watch, which shewed
the hour to be 2 a.m. The steps creaked, but seemed tolerably sound; and I raced down past
a barn-like second story to the ground floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes
answered my footfalls. At length I reached the lower hall, at one end of which I saw a faint
luminous rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway. Heading the other way, I found
the back door also open; and darted out and down five stone steps to the grass-grown
cobblestones of the courtyard.
The moonbeams did not reach down here, but I could just see my way about without using
the flashlight. Some of the windows on the Gilman House side were faintly glowing, and I
thought I heard confused sounds within. Walking softly over to the Washington Street side I
perceived several open doorways, and chose the nearest as my route out. The hallway inside
was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw that the street door was wedged
immovably shut. Resolved to try another building, I groped my way back toward the courtyard,
but stopped short when close to the doorway.
For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful shapes was
pouring—lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries
in what was certainly not English. The figures moved uncertainly, and I realised to my relief
that they did not know where I had gone; but for all that they sent a shiver of horror through
my frame. Their features were indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling gait was
abominably repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one figure was strangely robed, and
unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar. As the figures
spread throughout the courtyard, I felt my fears increase. Suppose I could find no egress from
this building on the street side? The fishy odour was detestable, and I wondered I could stand
it without fainting. Again groping toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came upon
an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows. Fumbling in the rays of my
flashlight, I found I could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed outside and
was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner.
I was now in Washington Street, and for the moment saw no living thing nor any light save
that of the moon. From several directions in the distance, however, I could hear the sound of
hoarse voices, of footsteps, and of a curious kind of pattering which did not sound quite like
footsteps. Plainly I had no time to lose. The points of the compass were clear to me, and I
was glad that all the street-lights were turned off, as is often the custom on strongly moonlit
nights in unprosperous rural regions. Some of the sounds came from the south, yet I retained
my design of escaping in that direction. There would, I knew, be plenty of deserted doorways
to shelter me in case I met any person or group who looked like pursuers.
I walked rapidly, softly, and close to the ruined houses. While hatless and dishevelled after my
arduous climb, I did not look especially noticeable; and stood a good chance of passing
unheeded if forced to encounter any casual wayfarer. At Bates Street I drew into a yawning
vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me, but was soon on my way again
and approaching the open space where Eliot Street obliquely crosses Washington at the
intersection of South. Though I had never seen this space, it had looked dangerous to me on
the grocery youth‘s map; since the moonlight would have free play there. There was no use
trying to evade it, for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous
visibility and delaying effect. The only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly; imitating
the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk as best I could, and trusting that no one—or at least
no pursuer of mine—would be there.
Just how fully the pursuit was organised—and indeed, just what its purpose might be—I could
form no idea. There seemed to be unusual activity in the town, but I judged that the news of
my escape from the Gilman had not yet spread. I would, of course, soon have to shift from
Washington to some other southward street; for that party from the hotel would doubtless be
after me. I must have left dust prints in that last old building, revealing how I had gained the
street.
The open space was, as I had expected, strongly moonlit; and I saw the remains of a park-
like, iron-railed green in its centre. Fortunately no one was about, though a curious sort of
buzz or roar seemed to be increasing in the direction of Town Square. South Street was very
wide, leading directly down a slight declivity to the waterfront and commanding a long view
out at sea; and I hoped that no one would be glancing up it from afar as I crossed in the bright
moonlight.
My progress was unimpeded, and no fresh sound arose to hint that I had been spied.
Glancing about me, I involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the
sea, gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street‘s end. Far out beyond the breakwater
was the dim, dark line of Devil Reef, and as I glimpsed it I could not help thinking of all the
hideous legends I had heard in the last thirty-four hours—legends which portrayed this ragged
rock as a veritable gateway to realms of unfathomed horror and inconceivable abnormality.
Then, without warning, I saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef. They were
definite and unmistakable, and awaked in my mind a blind horror beyond all rational
proportion. My muscles tightened for panic flight, held in only by a certain unconscious
caution and half-hypnotic fascination. And to make matters worse, there now flashed forth
from the lofty cupola of the Gilman House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a
series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an
answering signal.
Controlling my muscles, and realising afresh how plainly visible I was, I resumed my brisker
and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as
long as the opening of South Street gave me a seaward view. What the whole proceeding
meant, I could not imagine; unless it involved some strange rite connected with Devil Reef, or
unless some party had landed from a ship on that sinister rock. I now bent to the left around
the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer
moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons.
It was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me—the impression
which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and set me running frantically southward past
the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. For
at a closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from
empty. They were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town;
and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception I could tell that the
bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or
consciously formulated.
My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left I began to hear
something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit. There were footsteps and guttural
sounds, and a rattling motor wheezed south along Federal Street. In a second all my plans
were utterly changed—for if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I must clearly
find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into a gaping doorway, reflecting how
lucky I was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel
street.
A second reflection was less comforting. Since the pursuit was down another street, it was
plain that the party was not following me directly. It had not seen me, but was simply obeying
a general plan of cutting off my escape. This, however, implied that all roads leading out of
Innsmouth were similarly patrolled; for the denizens could not have known what route I
intended to take. If this were so, I would have to make my retreat across country away from
any road; but how could I do that in view of the marshy and creek-riddled nature of all the
surrounding region? For a moment my brain reeled—both from sheer hopelessness and from
a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odour.
Then I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose solid line of ballasted, weed-grown
earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river-
gorge. There was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that; since its brier-
choked desertion made it half-impassable, and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugitive to
choose. I had seen it clearly from my hotel window, and knew about how it lay. Most of its
earlier length was uncomfortably visible from the Rowley road, and from high places in the
town itself; but one could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth. At any
rate, it would form my only chance of deliverance, and there was nothing to do but try it.
Drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I once more consulted the grocery boy‘s map
with the aid of the flashlight. The immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway;
and I now saw that the safest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west to Lafayette—
there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one I had traversed—
and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette,
Bates, Adams, and Bank Streets—the latter skirting the river-gorge—to the abandoned and
dilapidated station I had seen from my window. My reason for going ahead to Babson was
that I wished neither to re-cross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course
along a cross street as broad as South.
Starting once more, I crossed the street to the right-hand side in order to edge around into
Babson as inconspicuously as possible. Noises still continued in Federal Street, and as I
glanced behind me I thought I saw a gleam of light near the building through which I had
escaped. Anxious to leave Washington Street, I broke into a quiet dog-trot, trusting to luck not
to encounter any observing eye. Next the corner of Babson Street I saw to my alarm that one
of the houses was still inhabited, as attested by curtains at the window; but there were no
lights within, and I passed it without disaster.
In Babson Street, which crossed Federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers, I clung
as closely as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway as the
noises behind me momentarily increased. The open space ahead shone wide and desolate
under the moon, but my route would not force me to cross it. During my second pause I
began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds; and upon looking cautiously out from
cover beheld a motor-car darting across the open space, bound outward along Eliot Street,
which there intersects both Babson and Lafayette.
As I watched—choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour after a short abatement—I saw a
band of uncouth, crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction; and knew
that this must be the party guarding the Ipswich road, since that highway forms an extension
of Eliot Street. Two of the figures I glimpsed were in voluminous robes, and one wore a
peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight. The gait of this figure was so odd
that it sent a chill through me—for it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping.
When the last of the band was out of sight I resumed my progress; darting around the corner
into Lafayette Street, and crossing Eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still
advancing along that thoroughfare. I did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off
toward Town Square, but accomplished the passage without disaster. My greatest dread was
in re-crossing broad and moonlit South Street—with its seaward view—and I had to nerve
myself for the ordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and possible Eliot Street stragglers
could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points. At the last moment I decided I had better
slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average
Innsmouth native.
When the view of the water again opened out—this time on my right—I was half-determined
not to look at it at all. I could not, however, resist; but cast a sidelong glance as I carefully and
imitatively shambled toward the protecting shadows ahead. There was no ship visible, as I
had half expected there would be. Instead, the first thing which caught my eye was a small
rowboat pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky, tarpaulin-
covered object. Its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially
repellent aspect. Several swimmers were still discernible; while on the far black reef I could
see a faint, steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before, and of a curious colour
which I could not precisely identify. Above the slant roofs ahead and to the right there loomed
the tall cupola of the Gilman House, but it was completely dark. The fishy odour, dispelled for
a moment by some merciful breeze, now closed in again with maddening intensity.
I had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band advancing along Washington
from the north. As they reached the broad open space where I had had my first disquieting
glimpse of the moonlit water I could see them plainly only a block away—and was horrified by
the bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog-like sub-humanness of their crouching gait.
One man moved in a positively simian way, with long arms frequently touching the ground;
while another figure—robed and tiaraed—seemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion. I
judged this party to be the one I had seen in the Gilman‘s courtyard—the one, therefore, most
closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned to look in my direction I was transfixed with
fright, yet managed to preserve the casual, shambling gait I had assumed. To this day I do not
know whether they saw me or not. If they did, my stratagem must have deceived them, for
they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their course—meanwhile croaking
and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois I could not identify.
Once more in shadow, I resumed my former dog-trot past the leaning and decrepit houses
that stared blankly into the night. Having crossed to the western sidewalk I rounded the
nearest corner into Bates Street, where I kept close to the buildings on the southern side. I
passed two houses shewing signs of habitation, one of which had faint lights in upper rooms,
yet met with no obstacle. As I turned into Adams Street I felt measurably safer, but received a
shock when a man reeled out of a black doorway directly in front of me. He proved, however,
too hopelessly drunk to be a menace; so that I reached the dismal ruins of the Bank Street
warehouses in safety.
No one was stirring in that dead street beside the river-gorge, and the roar of the waterfalls
quite drowned my footsteps. It was a long dog-trot to the ruined station, and the great brick
warehouse walls around me seemed somehow more terrifying than the fronts of private
houses. At last I saw the ancient arcaded station—or what was left of it—and made directly for
the tracks that started from its farther end.
The rails were rusty but mainly intact, and not more than half the ties had rotted away.
Walking or running on such a surface was very difficult; but I did my best, and on the whole
made very fair time. For some distance the line kept on along the gorge‘s brink, but at length I
reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height. The condition
of this bridge would determine my next step. If humanly possible, I would use it; if not, I would
have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge.
The vast, barn-like length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight, and I saw that
the ties were safe for at least a few feet within. Entering, I began to use my flashlight, and was
almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me. About half way across there
was a perilous gap in the ties which I feared for a moment would halt me; but in the end I
risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded.
I was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from that macabre tunnel. The old
tracks crossed River Street at grade, and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural
and with less and less of Innsmouth‘s abhorrent fishy odour. Here the dense growth of weeds
and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but I was none the less glad that they
were there to give me concealment in case of peril. I knew that much of my route must be
visible from the Rowley road.
The marshy region began very shortly, with the single track on a low, grassy embankment
where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner. Then came a sort of island of higher ground,
where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles. I was
very glad of this partial shelter, since at this point the Rowley road was uncomfortably near
according to my window view. At the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a
safer distance; but meanwhile I must be exceedingly careful. I was by this time thankfully
certain that the railway itself was not patrolled.
Just before entering the cut I glanced behind me, but saw no pursuer. The ancient spires and
roofs of decaying Innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight, and I
thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell. Then, as my
gaze circled inland from the town, something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me
immobile for a second.
What I saw—or fancied I saw—was a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the
south; a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of
the city along the level Ipswich road. The distance was great, and I could distinguish nothing
in detail; but I did not at all like the look of that moving column. It undulated too much, and
glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon. There was a suggestion of
sound, too, though the wind was blowing the other way—a suggestion of bestial scraping and
bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties I had lately overheard.
All sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I thought of those very extreme
Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried warrens near the waterfront. I
thought, too, of those nameless swimmers I had seen. Counting the parties so far glimpsed,
as well as those presumably covering other roads, the number of my pursuers must be
strangely large for a town as depopulated as Innsmouth.
Whence could come the dense personnel of such a column as I now beheld? Did those
ancient, unplumbed warrens teem with a twisted, uncatalogued, and unsuspected life? Or had
some unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown outsiders on that hellish reef? Who
were they? Why were they there? And if such a column of them was scouring the Ipswich
road, would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented?
I had entered the brush-grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that
damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant. Had the wind suddenly changed eastward, so
that it blew in from the sea and over the town? It must have, I concluded, since I now began
to hear shocking guttural murmurs from that hitherto silent direction. There was another
sound, too—a kind of wholesale, colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up
images of the most detestable sort. It made me think illogically of that unpleasantly undulating
column on the far-off Ipswich road.
And then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I paused shivering and grateful for
the cut‘s protection. It was here, I recalled, that the Rowley road drew so close to the old
railway before crossing westward and diverging. Something was coming along that road, and
I must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance. Thank heaven these creatures
employed no dogs for tracking—though perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the
omnipresent regional odour. Crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe,
even though I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more
than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see them, but they could not, except by a
malign miracle, see me.
All at once I began dreading to look at them as they passed. I saw the close moonlit space
where they would surge by, and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that
space. They would perhaps be the worst of all Innsmouth types—something one would not
care to remember.
The stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking,
baying, and barking without the least suggestion of human speech. Were these indeed the
voices of my pursuers? Did they have dogs after all? So far I had seen none of the lower
animals in Innsmouth. That flopping or pattering was monstrous—I could not look upon the
degenerate creatures responsible for it. I would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded
toward the west. The horde was very close now—the air foul with their hoarse snarlings, and
the ground almost shaking with their alien-rhythmed footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to
come, and I put every ounce of will power into the task of holding my eyelids down.
I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a
nightmare hallucination. The later action of the government, after my frantic appeals, would
tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth; but could not an hallucination have been repeated
under the quasi-hypnotic spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowed town? Such places
have strange properties, and the legacy of insane legend might well have acted on more than
one human imagination amidst those dead, stench-cursed streets and huddles of rotting roofs
and crumbling steeples. Is it not possible that the germ of an actual contagious madness lurks
in the depths of that shadow over Innsmouth? Who can be sure of reality after hearing things
like the tale of old Zadok Allen? The government men never found poor Zadok, and have no
conjectures to make as to what became of him. Where does madness leave off and reality
begin? Is it possible that even my latest fear is sheer delusion?
But I must try to tell what I thought I saw that night under the mocking yellow moon—saw
surging and hopping down the Rowley road in plain sight in front of me as I crouched among
the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut. Of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut
had failed. It was foredoomed to failure—for who could crouch blindly while a legion of
croaking, baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past, scarcely more than a
hundred yards away?
I thought I was prepared for the worst, and I really ought to have been prepared considering
what I had seen before. My other pursuers had been accursedly abnormal—so should I not
have been ready to face a strengthening of the abnormal element; to look upon forms in
which there was no mixture of the normal at all? I did not open my eyes until the raucous
clamour came loudly from a point obviously straight ahead. Then I knew that a long section of
them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the
track—and I could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow
moon might have to shew.
It was the end, for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth, of every vestige
of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of Nature and of the human mind. Nothing that
I could have imagined—nothing, even, that I could have gathered had I credited old Zadok‘s
crazy tale in the most literal way—would be in any way comparable to the daemoniac,
blasphemous reality that I saw—or believe I saw. I have tried to hint what it was in order to
postpone the horror of writing it down baldly. Can it be possible that this planet has actually
spawned such things; that human eyes have truly seen, as objective flesh, what man has
hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend?
And yet I saw them in a limitless stream—flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating—surging
inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic
nightmare. And some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitish-gold metal . . . and some
were strangely robed . . . and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black
coat and striped trousers, and had a man‘s felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that
answered for a head. . . .
I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white bellies. They
were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely
suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging
eyes that never closed. At the sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws
were webbed. They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying voices, clearly
used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces
lacked.
But for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me. I knew too well what they
must be—for was not the memory of that evil tiara at Newburyport still fresh? They were the
blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless design—living and horrible—and as I saw them I
knew also of what that humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so
fearsomely reminded me. Their number was past guessing. It seemed to me that there were
limitless swarms of them—and certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only the
least fraction. In another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting; the first
I had ever had.
V.
It was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brush-grown railway cut,
and when I staggered out to the roadway ahead I saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud.
The fishy odour, too, was gone. Innsmouth‘s ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up
greyly toward the southeast, but not a living creature did I spy in all the desolate salt marshes
around. My watch was still going, and told me that the hour was past noon.
The reality of what I had been through was highly uncertain in my mind, but I felt that
something hideous lay in the background. I must get away from evil-shadowed Innsmouth—
and accordingly I began to test my cramped, wearied powers of locomotion. Despite
weakness, hunger, horror, and bewilderment I found myself after a long time able to walk; so
started slowly along the muddy road to Rowley. Before evening I was in the village, getting a
meal and providing myself with presentable clothes. I caught the night train to Arkham, and
the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there; a process I later
repeated in Boston. With the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiar—and I
wish, for normality‘s sake, there were nothing more to tell. Perhaps it is madness that is
overtaking me—yet perhaps a greater horror—or a greater marvel—is reaching out.
As may well be imagined, I gave up most of the foreplanned features of the rest of my tour—
the scenic, architectural, and antiquarian diversions on which I had counted so heavily. Nor
did I dare look for that piece of strange jewellery said to be in the Miskatonic University
Museum. I did, however, improve my stay in Arkham by collecting some genealogical notes I
had long wished to possess; very rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use
later on when I might have time to collate and codify them. The curator of the historical
society there—Mr. E. Lapham Peabody—was very courteous about assisting me, and
expressed unusual interest when I told him I was a grandson of Eliza Orne of Arkham, who
was born in 1867 and had married James Williamson of Ohio at the age of seventeen.
It seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much
like my own; and that my grandmother‘s family was a topic of some local curiosity. There had,
Mr. Peabody said, been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father, Benjamin
Orne, just after the Civil War; since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling. That
bride was understood to have been an orphaned Marsh of New Hampshire—a cousin of the
Essex County Marshes—but her education had been in France and she knew very little of her
family. A guardian had deposited funds in a Boston bank to maintain her and her French
governess; but that guardian‘s name was unfamiliar to Arkham people, and in time he
dropped out of sight, so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment. The
Frenchwoman—now long dead—was very taciturn, and there were those who said she could
have told more than she did.
But the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the
young woman—Enoch and Lydia (Meserve) Marsh—among the known families of New
Hampshire. Possibly, many suggested, she was the natural daughter of some Marsh of
prominence—she certainly had the true Marsh eyes. Most of the puzzling was done after her
early death, which took place at the birth of my grandmother—her only child. Having formed
some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of Marsh, I did not welcome the
news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree; nor was I pleased by Mr. Peabody‘s
suggestion that I had the true Marsh eyes myself. However, I was grateful for data which I
knew would prove valuable; and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the
well-documented Orne family.
I went directly home to Toledo from Boston, and later spent a month at Maumee recuperating
from my ordeal. In September I entered Oberlin for my final year, and from then till the next
June was busy with studies and other wholesome activities—reminded of the bygone terror
only by occasional official visits from government men in connexion with the campaign which
my pleas and evidence had started. Around the middle of July—just a year after the
Innsmouth experience—I spent a week with my late mother‘s family in Cleveland; checking
some of my new genealogical data with the various notes, traditions, and bits of heirloom
material in existence there, and seeing what kind of connected chart I could construct.
I did not exactly relish the task, for the atmosphere of the Williamson home had always
depressed me. There was a strain of morbidity there, and my mother had never encouraged
my visiting her parents as a child, although she always welcomed her father when he came to
Toledo. My Arkham-born grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me, and I
do not think I grieved when she disappeared. I was eight years old then, and it was said that
she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle Douglas, her eldest son. He had
shot himself after a trip to New England—the same trip, no doubt, which had caused him to
be recalled at the Arkham Historical Society.
This uncle had resembled her, and I had never liked him either. Something about the staring,
unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague, unaccountable uneasiness. My
mother and uncle Walter had not looked like that. They were like their father, though poor little
cousin Lawrence—Walter‘s son—had been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother
before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at Canton. I had not
seen him in four years, but my uncle once implied that his state, both mental and physical,
was very bad. This worry had probably been a major cause of his mother‘s death two years
before.
My grandfather and his widowed son Walter now comprised the Cleveland household, but the
memory of older times hung thickly over it. I still disliked the place, and tried to get my
researches done as quickly as possible. Williamson records and traditions were supplied in
abundance by my grandfather; though for Orne material I had to depend on my uncle Walter,
who put at my disposal the contents of all his files, including notes, letters, cuttings,
heirlooms, photographs, and miniatures.
It was in going over the letters and pictures on the Orne side that I began to acquire a kind of
terror of my own ancestry. As I have said, my grandmother and uncle Douglas had always
disturbed me. Now, years after their passing, I gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably
heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation. I could not at first understand the change, but
gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind
despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it. It was
clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not
suggested before—something which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of.
But the worst shock came when my uncle shewed me the Orne jewellery in a downtown safe-
deposit vault. Some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough, but there was one box of
strange old pieces descended from my mysterious great-grandmother which my uncle was
almost reluctant to produce. They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost repulsive
design, and had never to his knowledge been publicly worn; though my grandmother used to
enjoy looking at them. Vague legends of bad luck clustered around them, and my great-
grandmother‘s French governess had said they ought not to be worn in New England, though
it would be quite safe to wear them in Europe.
As my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be
shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs. Artists and
archaeologists who had seen them pronounced the workmanship superlatively and exotically
exquisite, though no one seemed able to define their exact material or assign them to any
specific art tradition. There were two armlets, a tiara, and a kind of pectoral; the latter having
in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance.
During this description I had kept a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must have
betrayed my mounting fears. My uncle looked concerned, and paused in his unwrapping to
study my countenance. I motioned to him to continue, which he did with renewed signs of
reluctance. He seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piece—the tiara—
became visible, but I doubt if he expected quite what actually happened. I did not expect it,
either, for I thought I was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would turn out
to be. What I did was to faint silently away, just as I had done in that brier-choked railway cut
a year before.
From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension, nor do I know
how much is hideous truth and how much madness. My great-grandmother had been a Marsh
of unknown source whose husband lived in Arkham—and did not old Zadok say that the
daughter of Obed Marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an Arkham man through a
trick? What was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to Captain
Obed‘s? In Arkham, too, the curator had told me I had the true Marsh eyes. Was Obed Marsh
my own great-great-grandfather? Who—or what—then, was my great-great-grandmother?
But perhaps this was all madness. Those whitish-gold ornaments might easily have been
bought from some Innsmouth sailor by the father of my great-grandmother, whoever he was.
And that look in the staring-eyed faces of my grandmother and self-slain uncle might be sheer
fancy on my part—sheer fancy, bolstered up by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly
coloured my imagination. But why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in New
England?
For more than two years I fought off these reflections with partial success. My father secured
me a place in an insurance office, and I buried myself in routine as deeply as possible. In the
winter of 1930–31, however, the dreams began. They were very sparse and insidious at first,
but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by. Great watery spaces opened
out before me, and I seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of
weedy Cyclopean walls with grotesque fishes as my companions. Then the other shapes
began to appear, filling me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But during the dreams
they did not horrify me at all—I was one with them; wearing their unhuman trappings, treading
their aqueous ways, and praying monstrously at their evil sea-bottom temples.
There was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember each morning
would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever I dared write it down. Some
frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome
life into unnamable abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process told heavily on me.
My health and appearance grew steadily worse, till finally I was forced to give up my position
and adopt the static, secluded life of an invalid. Some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip,
and I found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes.
It was then that I began to study the mirror with mounting alarm. The slow ravages of disease
are not pleasant to watch, but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in
the background. My father seemed to notice it, too, for he began looking at me curiously and
almost affrightedly. What was taking place in me? Could it be that I was coming to resemble
my grandmother and uncle Douglas?
One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my grandmother under the sea. She lived in a
phosphorescent palace of many terraces, with gardens of strange leprous corals and
grotesque brachiate efflorescences, and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been
sardonic. She had changed—as those who take to the water change—and told me she had
never died. Instead, she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about, and had leaped
to a realm whose wonders—destined for him as well—he had spurned with a smoking pistol.
This was to be my realm, too—I could not escape it. I would never die, but would live with
those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth.
I met also that which had been her grandmother. For eighty thousand years Pth‘thya-l‘yi had
lived in Y‘ha-nthlei, and thither she had gone back after Obed Marsh was dead. Y‘ha-nthlei
was not destroyed when the upper-earth men shot death into the sea. It was hurt, but not
destroyed. The Deep Ones could never be destroyed, even though the palaeogean magic of
the forgotten Old Ones might sometimes check them. For the present they would rest; but
some day, if they remembered, they would rise again for the tribute Great Cthulhu craved. It
would be a city greater than Innsmouth next time. They had planned to spread, and had
brought up that which would help them, but now they must wait once more. For bringing the
upper-earth men‘s death I must do a penance, but that would not be heavy. This was the
dream in which I saw a shoggoth for the first time, and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of
screaming. That morning the mirror definitely told me I had acquired the Innsmouth look.
So far I have not shot myself as my uncle Douglas did. I bought an automatic and almost took
the step, but certain dreams deterred me. The tense extremes of horror are lessening, and I
feel queerly drawn toward the unknown sea-deeps instead of fearing them. I hear and do
strange things in sleep, and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror. I do not believe I
need to wait for the full change as most have waited. If I did, my father would probably shut
me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up. Stupendous and unheard-of
splendours await me below, and I shall seek them soon. Iä-R’lyeh! Cthulhu fhtagn! Iä! Iä! No, I
shall not shoot myself—I cannot be made to shoot myself!
I shall plan my cousin‘s escape from that Canton madhouse, and together we shall go to
marvel-shadowed Innsmouth. We shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive
down through black abysses to Cyclopean and many-columned Y‘ha-nthlei, and in that lair of
the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory for ever.

The Dreams in the Witch House
(1932)
Whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the dreams Walter Gilman
did not know. Behind everything crouched the brooding, festering horror of the ancient town,
and of the mouldy, unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with
figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed. His ears were growing
sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap
mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night the subtle
stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the
creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of
strident pandemonium. The darkness always teemed with unexplained sound—and yet he
sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear
certain other, fainter, noises which he suspected were lurking behind them.
He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering gambrel roofs
that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King‘s men in the dark, olden days
of the Province. Nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the
gable room which harboured him—for it was this house and this room which had likewise
harboured old Keziah Mason, whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able
to explain. That was in 1692—the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small, white-fanged
furry thing which scuttled out of Keziah‘s cell, and not even Cotton Mather could explain the
curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red, sticky fluid.
Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and quantum
physics are enough to stretch any brain; and when one mixes them with folklore, and tries to
trace a strange background of multi-dimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the
Gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimney-corner, one can hardly expect to be wholly
free from mental tension. Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered
college in Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of
elder magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination. The
professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his
course at several points. Moreover, they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old
books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university
library. But all these precautions came late in the day, so that Gilman had some terrible hints
from the dreaded Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred, the fragmentary Book of Eibon,and the
suppressed Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on
the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknown.
He knew his room was in the old Witch House—that, indeed, was why he had taken it. There
was much in the Essex County records about Keziah Mason‘s trial, and what she had
admitted under pressure to the Court of Oyer and Terminer had fascinated Gilman beyond all
reason. She had told Judge Hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out
directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond, and had implied that
such lines and curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of
the white stone beyond Meadow Hill and on the unpeopled island in the river. She had spoken
also of the Black Man, of her oath, and of her new secret name of Nahab. Then she had
drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanished.
Gilman believed strange things about Keziah, and had felt a queer thrill on learning that her
dwelling was still standing after more than 235 years. When he heard the hushed Arkham
whispers about Keziah‘s persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets, about
the irregular human tooth-marks left on certain sleepers in that and other houses, about the
childish cries heard near May-Eve, and Hallowmass, about the stench often noted in the old
house‘s attic just after those dreaded seasons, and about the small, furry, sharp-toothed thing
which haunted the mouldering structure and the town and nuzzled people curiously in the
black hours before dawn, he resolved to live in the place at any cost. A room was easy to
secure; for the house was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings.
Gilman could not have told what he expected to find there, but he knew he wanted to be in
the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old
woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the
utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, and de Sitter.
He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot
where the paper had peeled, and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where
Keziah was held to have practiced her spells. It had been vacant from the first—for no one
had ever been willing to stay there long—but the Polish landlord had grown wary about
renting it. Yet nothing whatever happened to Gilman till about the time of the fever. No ghostly
Keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his
dismal eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch‘s incantations rewarded his constant
search. Sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty-smelling
lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly
through narrow, small-paned windows. Here he knew strange things had happened once, and
there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might
not—at least in the darkest, narrowest, and most intricately crooked alleys—have utterly
perished. He also rowed out twice to the ill-regarded island in the river, and made a sketch of
the singular angles described by the moss-grown rows of grey standing stones whose origin
was so obscure and immemorial.
Gilman‘s room was of good size but queerly irregular shape; the north wall slanting
perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end, while the low ceiling slanted gently
downward in the same direction. Aside from an obvious rat-hole and the signs of other
stopped-up ones, there was no access—nor any appearance of a former avenue of access—
to the space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the straight outer wall on
the house‘s north side, though a view from the exterior shewed where a window had been
boarded up at a very remote date. The loft above the ceiling—which must have had a slanting
floor—was likewise inaccessible. When Gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level
loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily
covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial
carpentry. No amount of persuasion, however, could induce the stolid landlord to let him
investigate either of these two closed spaces.
As time wore along, his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased; for
he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer
vague clues regarding their purpose. Old Keziah, he reflected, might have had excellent
reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles; for was it not through certain angles that she
claimed to have gone outside the boundaries of the world of space we know? His interest
gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces, since it now
appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was already on.
The touch of brain-fever and the dreams began early in February. For some time, apparently,
the curious angles of Gilman‘s room had been having a strange, almost hypnotic effect on
him; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at
the corner where the down-slanting ceiling met the inward-slanting wall. About this period his
inability to concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably, his apprehensions
about the mid-year examinations being very acute. But the exaggerated sense of hearing was
scarcely less annoying. Life had become an insistent and almost unendurable cacophony,
and there was that constant, terrifying impression of other sounds—perhaps from regions
beyond life—trembling on the very brink of audibility. So far as concrete noises went, the rats
in the ancient partitions were the worst. Sometimes their scratching seemed not only furtive
but deliberate. When it came from beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of
dry rattling—and when it came from the century-closed loft above the slanting ceiling Gilman
always braced himself as if expecting some horror which only bided its time before
descending to engulf him utterly.
The dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity, and Gilman felt that they must be a result,
jointly, of his studies in mathematics and in folklore. He had been thinking too much about the
vague regions which his formulae told him must lie beyond the three dimensions we know,
and about the possibility that old Keziah Mason—guided by some influence past all
conjecture—had actually found the gate to those regions. The yellowed county records
containing her testimony and that of her accusers were so damnably suggestive of things
beyond human experience—and the descriptions of the darting little furry object which served
as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their incredible details.
That object—no larger than a good-sized rat and quaintly called by the townspeople ―Brown
Jenkin‖—seemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable case of sympathetic herd-delusion,
for in 1692 no less than eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it. There were recent
rumours, too, with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement. Witnesses said it had
long hair and the shape of a rat, but that its sharp-toothed, bearded face was evilly human
while its paws were like tiny human hands. It took messages betwixt old Keziah and the devil,
and was nursed on the witch‘s blood—which it sucked like a vampire. Its voice was a kind of
loathsome titter, and it could speak all languages. Of all the bizarre monstrosities in Gilman‘s
dreams, nothing filled him with greater panic and nausea than this blasphemous and
diminutive hybrid, whose image flitted across his vision in a form a thousandfold more hateful
than anything his waking mind had deduced from the ancient records and the modern
whispers.
Gilman‘s dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably
coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound; abysses whose material and gravitational
properties, and whose relation to his own entity, he could not even begin to explain. He did
not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion
partly voluntary and partly involuntary. Of his own condition he could not well judge, for sight
of his arms, legs, and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of
perspective; but he felt that his physical organisation and faculties were somehow
marvellously transmuted and obliquely projected—though not without a certain grotesque
relationship to his normal proportions and properties.
The abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably angled masses of
alien-hued substance, some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic.
A few of the organic objects tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind, though
he could form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested. In the later
dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into which the organic objects appeared
to be divided, and which seemed to involve in each case a radically different species of
conduct-pattern and basic motivation. Of these categories one seemed to him to include
objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the members of the other
categories.
All the objects—organic and inorganic alike—were totally beyond description or even
comprehension. Gilman sometimes compared the inorganic masses to prisms, labyrinths,
clusters of cubes and planes, and Cyclopean buildings; and the organic things struck him
variously as groups of bubbles, octopi, centipedes, living Hindoo idols, and intricate
Arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation. Everything he saw was unspeakably
menacing and horrible; and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to
be noticing him, he felt a stark, hideous fright which generally jolted him awake. Of how the
organic entities moved, he could tell no more than of how he moved himself. In time he
observed a further mystery—the tendency of certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty
space, or to disappear totally with equal suddenness. The shrieking, roaring confusion of
sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch, timbre, or rhythm; but
seemed to be synchronous with vague visual changes in all the indefinite objects, organic and
inorganic alike. Gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some unbearable
degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure, relentlessly inevitable fluctuations.
But it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw Brown Jenkin. That shocking
little horror was reserved for certain lighter, sharper dreams which assailed him just before he
dropped into the fullest depths of sleep. He would be lying in the dark fighting to keep awake
when a faint lambent glow would seem to shimmer around the centuried room, shewing in a
violet mist the convergence of angled planes which had seized his brain so insidiously. The
horror would appear to pop out of the rat-hole in the corner and patter toward him over the
sagging, wide-planked floor with evil expectancy in its tiny, bearded human face—but
mercifully, this dream always melted away before the object got close enough to nuzzle him. It
had hellishly long, sharp, canine teeth. Gilman tried to stop up the rat-hole every day, but
each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away the obstruction, whatever it
might be. Once he had the landlord nail tin over it, but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh
hole—in making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of
bone.
Gilman did not report his fever to the doctor, for he knew he could not pass the examinations
if ordered to the college infirmary when every moment was needed for cramming. As it was,
he failed in Calculus D and Advanced General Psychology, though not without hope of
making up lost ground before the end of the term. It was in March when the fresh element
entered his lighter preliminary dreaming, and the nightmare shape of Brown Jenkin began to
be companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a bent old
woman. This addition disturbed him more than he could account for, but finally he decided
that it was like an ancient crone whom he had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of
lanes near the abandoned wharves. On those occasions the evil, sardonic, and seemingly
unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost shivering—especially the first time,
when an overgrown rat darting across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made
him think irrationally of Brown Jenkin. Now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being
mirrored in his disordered dreams.
That the influence of the old house was unwholesome, he could not deny; but traces of his
early morbid interest still held him there. He argued that the fever alone was responsible for
his nightly phantasies, and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous
visions. Those visions, however, were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness, and
whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he
remembered. He was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had talked with both Brown
Jenkin and the old woman, and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them
and to meet a third being of greater potency.
Toward the end of March he began to pick up in his mathematics, though other studies
bothered him increasingly. He was getting an intuitive knack for solving Riemannian
equations, and astonished Professor Upham by his comprehension of fourth-dimensional and
other problems which had floored all the rest of the class. One afternoon there was a
discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or
even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the
farthest stars or the trans-galactic gulfs themselves—or even as fabulously remote as the
tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole Einsteinian space-time continuum.
Gilman‘s handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration, even though some of his
hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous
and solitary eccentricity. What made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that
a man might—given mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood of human
acquirement—step deliberately from the earth to any other celestial body which might lie at
one of an infinity of specific points in the cosmic pattern.
Such a step, he said, would require only two stages; first, a passage out of the three-
dimensional sphere we know, and second, a passage back to the three-dimensional sphere at
another point, perhaps one of infinite remoteness. That this could be accomplished without
loss of life was in many cases conceivable. Any being from any part of three-dimensional
space could probably survive in the fourth dimension; and its survival of the second stage
would depend upon what alien part of three-dimensional space it might select for its re-entry.
Denizens of some planets might be able to live on certain others—even planets belonging to
other galaxies, or to similar-dimensional phases of other space-time continua—though of
course there must be vast numbers of mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically
juxtaposed bodies or zones of space.
It was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could survive entry to
many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or indefinitely multiplied
dimensions—be they within or outside the given space-time continuum—and that the
converse would be likewise true. This was a matter for speculation, though one could be fairly
certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to
the next higher plane would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it.
Gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness
here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points. Professor
Upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain
phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity—human or pre-
human—whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours.
Around the first of April Gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did not abate. He
was also troubled by what some of his fellow-lodgers said about his sleep-walking. It seemed
that he was often absent from his bed, and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the
night was remarked by the man in the room below. This fellow also spoke of hearing the tread
of shod feet in the night; but Gilman was sure he must have been mistaken in this, since
shoes as well as other apparel were always precisely in place in the morning. One could
develop all sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old house—for did not Gilman himself, even
in daylight, now feel certain that noises other than rat-scratchings came from the black voids
beyond the slanting wall and above the slanting ceiling? His pathologically sensitive ears
began to listen for faint footfalls in the immemorially sealed loft overhead, and sometimes the
illusion of such things was agonisingly realistic.
However, he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist; for twice at night his room
had been found vacant, though with all his clothing in place. Of this he had been assured by
Frank Elwood, the one fellow-student whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and
unpopular house. Elwood had been studying in the small hours and had come up for help on
a differential equation, only to find Gilman absent. It had been rather presumptuous of him to
open the unlocked door after knocking had failed to rouse a response, but he had needed the
help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle prodding awake. On neither
occasion, though, had Gilman been there—and when told of the matter he wondered where
he could have been wandering, barefoot and with only his night-clothes on. He resolved to
investigate the matter if reports of his sleep-walking continued, and thought of sprinkling flour
on the floor of the corridor to see where his footsteps might lead. The door was the only
conceivable egress, for there was no possible foothold outside the narrow window.
As April advanced Gilman‘s fever-sharpened ears were disturbed by the whining prayers of a
superstitious loomfixer named Joe Mazurewicz, who had a room on the ground floor.
Mazurewicz had told long, rambling stories about the ghost of old Keziah and the furry, sharp-
fanged, nuzzling thing, and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only his silver
crucifix—given him for the purpose by Father Iwanicki of St. Stanislaus‘ Church—could bring
him relief. Now he was praying because the Witches‘ Sabbath was drawing near. May-Eve
was Walpurgis-Night, when hell‘s blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of Satan
gathered for nameless rites and deeds. It was always a very bad time in Arkham, even though
the fine folks up in Miskatonic Avenue and High and Saltonstall Streets pretended to know
nothing about it. There would be bad doings—and a child or two would probably be missing.
Joe knew about such things, for his grandmother in the old country had heard tales from her
grandmother. It was wise to pray and count one‘s beads at this season. For three months
Keziah and Brown Jenkin had not been near Joe‘s room, nor near Paul Choynski‘s room, nor
anywhere else—and it meant no good when they held off like that. They must be up to
something.
Gilman dropped in at a doctor‘s office on the 16th of the month, and was surprised to find his
temperature was not as high as he had feared. The physician questioned him sharply, and
advised him to see a nerve specialist. On reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the still
more inquisitive college doctor. Old Waldron, who had curtailed his activities before, would
have made him take a rest—an impossible thing now that he was so close to great results in
his equations. He was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the
fourth dimension, and who could say how much farther he might go?
But even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his strange
confidence. Did all of this perilous sense of imminence come from the formulae on the sheets
he covered day by day? The soft, stealthy, imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were
unnerving. And now, too, there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly
persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do. How about the
somnambulism? Where did he go sometimes in the night? And what was that faint suggestion
of sound which once in a while seemed to trickle through the maddening confusion of
identifiable sounds even in broad daylight and full wakefulness? Its rhythm did not correspond
to anything on earth, unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two unmentionable Sabbat-
chants, and sometimes he feared it corresponded to certain attributes of the vague shrieking
or roaring in those wholly alien abysses of dream.
The dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious. In the lighter preliminary phase the evil
old woman was now of fiendish distinctness, and Gilman knew she was the one who had
frightened him in the slums. Her bent back, long nose, and shrivelled chin were unmistakable,
and her shapeless brown garments were like those he remembered. The expression on her
face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation, and when he awaked he could recall a
croaking voice that persuaded and threatened. He must meet the Black Man, and go with
them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate Chaos. That was what she said. He
must sign in his own blood the book of Azathoth and take a new secret name now that his
independent delvings had gone so far. What kept him from going with her and Brown Jenkin
and the other to the throne of Chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he
had seen the name ―Azathoth‖ in the Necronomicon, and knew it stood for a primal evil too
horrible for description.
The old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant
met the inward slant. She seemed to crystallise at a point closer to the ceiling than to the
floor, and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted.
Brown Jenkin, too, was always a little nearer at the last, and its yellowish-white fangs
glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet phosphorescence. Its shrill loathsome tittering
stuck more and more in Gilman‘s head, and he could remember in the morning how it had
pronounced the words ―Azathoth‖ and ―Nyarlathotep‖.
In the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and Gilman felt that the twilight
abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension. Those organic entities whose
motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of life-
forms from our own planet, including human beings. What the others were in their own
dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think. Two of the less irrelevantly moving
things—a rather large congeries of iridescent, prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much
smaller polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface angles—seemed to take
notice of him and follow him about or float ahead as he changed position among the titan
prisms, labyrinths, cube-and-plane clusters, and quasi-buildings; and all the while the vague
shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder, as if approaching some monstrous climax of
utterly unendurable intensity.
During the night of April 19–20 the new development occurred. Gilman was half-involuntarily
moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubble-mass and the small polyhedron floating
ahead, when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic
neighbouring prism-clusters. In another second he was out of the abyss and standing
tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense, diffused green light. He was barefooted and
in his night-clothes, and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet. A
swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight, and he shrank
from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapour.
Then he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward him—the old woman and the little
furry thing. The crone strained up to her knees and managed to cross her arms in a singular
fashion, while Brown Jenkin pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid fore paw
which it raised with evident difficulty. Spurred by an impulse he did not originate, Gilman
dragged himself forward along a course determined by the angle of the old woman‘s arms
and the direction of the small monstrosity‘s paw, and before he had shuffled three steps he
was back in the twilight abysses. Geometrical shapes seethed around him, and he fell dizzily
and interminably. At last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old
house.
He was good for nothing that morning, and stayed away from all his classes. Some unknown
attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly irrelevant direction, for he could not help staring
at a certain vacant spot on the floor. As the day advanced the focus of his unseeing eyes
changed position, and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at vacancy. About two
o‘clock he went out for lunch, and as he threaded the narrow lanes of the city he found
himself turning always to the southeast. Only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in Church
Street, and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly.
He would have to consult a nerve specialist after all—perhaps there was a connexion with his
somnambulism—but meanwhile he might at least try to break the morbid spell himself.
Undoubtedly he could still manage to walk away from the pull; so with great resolution he
headed against it and dragged himself deliberately north along Garrison Street. By the time
he had reached the bridge over the Miskatonic he was in a cold perspiration, and he clutched
at the iron railing as he gazed upstream at the ill-regarded island whose regular lines of
ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlight.
Then he gave a start. For there was a clearly visible living figure on that desolate island, and
a second glance told him it was certainly the strange old woman whose sinister aspect had
worked itself so disastrously into his dreams. The tall grass near her was moving, too, as if
some other living thing were crawling close to the ground. When the old woman began to turn
toward him he fled precipitately off the bridge and into the shelter of the town‘s labyrinthine
waterfront alleys. Distant though the island was, he felt that a monstrous and invincible evil
could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent, ancient figure in brown.
The southeastward pull still held, and only with tremendous resolution could Gilman drag
himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs. For hours he sat silent and aimless, with
his eyes shifting gradually westward. About six o‘clock his sharpened ears caught the whining
prayers of Joe Mazurewicz two floors below, and in desperation he seized his hat and walked
out into the sunset-golden streets, letting the now directly southward pull carry him where it
might. An hour later darkness found him in the open fields beyond Hangman‘s Brook, with the
glimmering spring stars shining ahead. The urge to walk was gradually changing to an urge to
leap mystically into space, and suddenly he realised just where the source of the pull lay.
It was in the sky. A definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him.
Apparently it was a point somewhere between Hydra and Argo Navis, and he knew that he
had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn. In the morning it had
been underfoot; afternoon found it rising in the southeast, and now it was roughly south but
wheeling toward the west. What was the meaning of this new thing? Was he going mad? How
long would it last? Again mustering his resolution, Gilman turned and dragged himself back to
the sinister old house.
Mazurewicz was waiting for him at the door, and seemed both anxious and reluctant to
whisper some fresh bit of superstition. It was about the witch light. Joe had been out
celebrating the night before—it was Patriots‘ Day in Massachusetts—and had come home
after midnight. Looking up at the house from outside, he had thought at first that Gilman‘s
window was dark; but then he had seen the faint violet glow within. He wanted to warn the
gentleman about that glow, for everybody in Arkham knew it was Keziah‘s witch light which
played near Brown Jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself. He had not mentioned this
before, but now he must tell about it because it meant that Keziah and her long-toothed
familiar were haunting the young gentleman. Sometimes he and Paul Choynski and Landlord
Dombrowski thought they saw that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the
young gentleman‘s room, but they had all agreed not to talk about that. However, it would be
better for the gentleman to take another room and get a crucifix from some good priest like
Father Iwanicki.
As the man rambled on Gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his throat. He knew that Joe
must have been half drunk when he came home the night before, yet this mention of a violet
light in the garret window was of frightful import. It was a lambent glow of this sort which
always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter, sharper dreams
which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses, and the thought that a wakeful second
person could see the dream-luminance was utterly beyond sane harbourage. Yet where had
the fellow got such an odd notion? Had he himself talked as well as walked around the house
in his sleep? No, Joe said, he had not—but he must check up on this. Perhaps Frank Elwood
could tell him something, though he hated to ask.
Fever—wild dreams—somnambulism—illusions of sounds—a pull toward a point in the sky—
and now a suspicion of insane sleep-talking! He must stop studying, see a nerve specialist,
and take himself in hand. When he climbed to the second story he paused at Elwood‘s door
but saw that the other youth was out. Reluctantly he continued up to his garret room and sat
down in the dark. His gaze was still pulled to the southwest, but he also found himself
listening intently for some sound in the closed loft above, and half imagining that an evil violet
light seeped down through an infinitesimal crack in the low, slanting ceiling.
That night as Gilman slept the violet light broke upon him with heightened intensity, and the
old witch and small furry thing—getting closer than ever before—mocked him with inhuman
squeals and devilish gestures. He was glad to sink into the vaguely roaring twilight abysses,
though the pursuit of that iridescent bubble-congeries and that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron
was menacing and irritating. Then came the shift as vast converging planes of a slippery-
looking substance loomed above and below him—a shift which ended in a flash of delirium
and a blaze of unknown, alien light in which yellow, carmine, and indigo were madly and
inextricably blended.
He was half lying on a high, fantastically balustraded terrace above a boundless jungle of
outlandish, incredible peaks, balanced planes, domes, minarets, horizontal discs poised on
pinnacles, and numberless forms of still greater wildness—some of stone and some of
metal—which glittered gorgeously in the mixed, almost blistering glare from a polychromatic
sky. Looking upward he saw three stupendous discs of flame, each of a different hue, and at a
different height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains. Behind him tiers
of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see. The city below stretched away to the
limits of vision, and he hoped that no sound would well up from it.
The pavement from which he easily raised himself was of a veined, polished stone beyond his
power to identify, and the tiles were cut in bizarre-angled shapes which struck him as less
asymmetrical than based on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend.
The balustrade was chest-high, delicate, and fantastically wrought, while along the rail were
ranged at short intervals little figures of grotesque design and exquisite workmanship. They,
like the whole balustrade, seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose colour
could not be guessed in this chaos of mixed effulgences; and their nature utterly defied
conjecture. They represented some ridged, barrel-shaped object with thin horizontal arms
radiating spoke-like from a central ring, and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from the
head and base of the barrel. Each of these knobs was the hub of a system of five long, flat,
triangularly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms of a starfish—nearly horizontal, but
curving slightly away from the central barrel. The base of the bottom knob was fused to the
long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several figures had been broken off and
were missing. The figures were about four and a half inches in height, while the spiky arms
gave them a maximum diameter of about two and a half inches.
When Gilman stood up the tiles felt hot to his bare feet. He was wholly alone, and his first act
was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless, Cyclopean city almost two
thousand feet below. As he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings
covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath, and he wished he
might discern the denizens of the place. The sight turned him giddy after a while, so that he
would have fallen to the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous balustrade.
His right hand fell on one of the projecting figures, the touch seeming to steady him slightly. It
was too much, however, for the exotic delicacy of the metal-work, and the spiky figure
snapped off under his grasp. Still half-dazed, he continued to clutch it as his other hand
seized a vacant space on the smooth railing.
But now his oversensitive ears caught something behind him, and he looked back across the
level terrace. Approaching him softly though without apparent furtiveness were five figures,
two of which were the sinister old woman and the fanged, furry little animal. The other three
were what sent him unconscious—for they were living entities about eight feet high, shaped
precisely like the spiky images on the balustrade, and propelling themselves by a spider-like
wriggling of their lower set of starfish-arms.
Gilman awakened in his bed, drenched by a cold perspiration and with a smarting sensation
in his face, hands, and feet. Springing to the floor, he washed and dressed in frantic haste, as
if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible. He did not know
where he wished to go, but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes. The
odd pull toward that spot in the sky between Hydra and Argo had abated, but another of even
greater strength had taken its place. Now he felt that he must go north—infinitely north. He
dreaded to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the Miskatonic, so went
over the Peabody Avenue bridge. Very often he stumbled, for his eyes and ears were chained
to an extremely lofty point in the blank blue sky.
After about an hour he got himself under better control, and saw that he was far from the city.
All around him stretched the bleak emptiness of salt marshes, while the narrow road ahead
led to Innsmouth—that ancient, half-deserted town which Arkham people were so curiously
unwilling to visit. Though the northward pull had not diminished, he resisted it as he had
resisted the other pull, and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the
other. Plodding back to town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain, he dragged himself
into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter magazines. Once he met
some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he looked, but he did not tell them of his
walk. At three o‘clock he took some lunch at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had
either lessened or divided itself. After that he killed the time at a cheap cinema show, seeing
the inane performance over and over again without paying any attention to it.
About nine at night he drifted homeward and stumbled into the ancient house. Joe
Mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers, and Gilman hastened up to his own garret
chamber without pausing to see if Elwood was in. It was when he turned on the feeble electric
light that the shock came. At once he saw there was something on the table which did not
belong there, and a second look left no room for doubt. Lying on its side—for it could not
stand up alone—was the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off
the fantastic balustrade. No detail was missing. The ridged, barrel-shaped centre, the thin,
radiating arms, the knobs at each end, and the flat, slightly outward-curving starfish-arms
spreading from those knobs—all were there. In the electric light the colour seemed to be a
kind of iridescent grey veined with green, and Gilman could see amidst his horror and
bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break corresponding to its former point
of attachment to the dream-railing.
Only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud. This fusion of
dream and reality was too much to bear. Still dazed, he clutched at the spiky thing and
staggered downstairs to Landlord Dombrowski‘s quarters. The whining prayers of the
superstitious loomfixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls, but Gilman did not mind
them now. The landlord was in, and greeted him pleasantly. No, he had not seen that thing
before and did not know anything about it. But his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in
one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon, and maybe that was it. Dombrowski called
her, and she waddled in. Yes, that was the thing. She had found it in the young gentleman‘s
bed—on the side next the wall. It had looked very queer to her, but of course the young
gentleman had lots of queer things in his room—books and curios and pictures and markings
on paper. She certainly knew nothing about it.
So Gilman climbed upstairs again in a mental turmoil, convinced that he was either still
dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes and led him to
depredations in unknown places. Where had he got this outré thing? He did not recall seeing
it in any museum in Arkham. It must have been somewhere, though; and the sight of it as he
snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd dream-picture of the balustraded terrace.
Next day he would make some very guarded inquiries—and perhaps see the nerve specialist.
Meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism. As he went upstairs and across
the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowed—with a frank admission
as to its purpose—from the landlord. He had stopped at Elwood‘s door on the way, but had
found all dark within. Entering his room, he placed the spiky thing on the table, and lay down
in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress. From the closed loft
above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding, but he was too
disorganised even to mind it. That cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again,
though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the sky.
In the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged, furry thing came again and
with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion. This time they actually reached him,
and he felt the crone‘s withered claws clutching at him. He was pulled out of bed and into
empty space, and for a moment he heard a rhythmic roaring and saw the twilight
amorphousness of the vague abysses seething around him. But that moment was very brief,
for presently he was in a crude, windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to
a peak just above his head, and with a curious slanting floor underfoot. Propped level on that
floor were low cases full of books of every degree of antiquity and disintegration, and in the
centre were a table and bench, both apparently fastened in place. Small objects of unknown
shape and nature were ranged on the tops of the cases, and in the flaming violet light Gilman
thought he saw a counterpart of the spiky image which had puzzled him so horribly. On the
left the floor fell abruptly away, leaving a black triangular gulf out of which, after a second‘s dry
rattling, there presently climbed the hateful little furry thing with the yellow fangs and bearded
human face.
The evilly grinning beldame still clutched him, and beyond the table stood a figure he had
never seen before—a tall, lean man of dead black colouration but without the slightest sign of
negroid features; wholly devoid of either hair or beard, and wearing as his only garment a
shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric. His feet were indistinguishable because of the
table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he
changed position. The man did not speak, and bore no trace of expression on his small,
regular features. He merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table,
while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman‘s right hand. Over everything was a pall
of intensely maddening fear, and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the
dreamer‘s clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm, finally biting him sharply in the
wrist just below his cuff. As the blood spurted from this wound Gilman lapsed into a faint.
He awaked on the morning of the 22nd with a pain in his left wrist, and saw that his cuff was
brown with dried blood. His recollections were very confused, but the scene with the black
man in the unknown space stood out vividly. The rats must have bitten him as he slept, giving
rise to the climax of that frightful dream. Opening the door, he saw that the flour on the
corridor floor was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at
the other end of the garret. So he had not been sleep-walking this time. But something would
have to be done about those rats. He would speak to the landlord about them. Again he tried
to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting wall, wedging in a candlestick which seemed of
about the right size. His ears were ringing horribly, as if with the residual echoes of some
horrible noise heard in dreams.
As he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after the scene in
the violet-litten space, but nothing definite would crystallise in his mind. That scene itself must
have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead, which had begun to attack his imagination so
violently, but later impressions were faint and hazy. There were suggestions of the vague,
twilight abysses, and of still vaster, blacker abysses beyond them—abysses in which all fixed
suggestions of form were absent. He had been taken there by the bubble-congeries and the
little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had changed to wisps of
milky, barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness. Something else had
gone on ahead—a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations
of form—and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along
the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the
physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos. Eventually there had been a hint of
vast, leaping shadows, of a monstrous, half-acoustic pulsing, and of the thin, monotonous
piping of an unseen flute—but that was all. Gilman decided he had picked up that last
conception from what he had read in the Necronomicon about the mindless entity Azathoth,
which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of Chaos.
When the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight, and Gilman puzzled
over the location of the two tiny punctures. It occurred to him that there was no blood on the
bedspread where he had lain—which was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and
cuff. Had he been sleep-walking within his room, and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some
chair or paused in some less rational position? He looked in every corner for brownish drops
or stains, but did not find any. He had better, he thought, sprinkle flour within the room as well
as outside the door—though after all no further proof of his sleep-walking was needed. He
knew he did walk—and the thing to do now was to stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help.
This morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by
another sensation even more inexplicable. It was a vague, insistent impulse to fly away from
his present situation, but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly. As
he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a
trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge.
He took the spiky image down to Elwood‘s room, steeling himself against the whines of the
loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor. Elwood was in, thank heaven, and appeared
to be stirring about. There was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and
college, so Gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears. His host
was very sympathetic, and agreed that something ought to be done. He was shocked by his
guest‘s drawn, haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking sunburn which
others had remarked during the past week. There was not much, though, that he could say.
He had not seen Gilman on any sleep-walking expedition, and had no idea what the curious
image could be. He had, though, heard the French-Canadian who lodged just under Gilman
talking to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each other how badly they dreaded the
coming of Walpurgis-Night, now only a few days off; and were exchanging pitying comments
about the poor, doomed young gentleman. Desrochers, the fellow under Gilman‘s room, had
spoken of nocturnal footsteps both shod and unshod, and of the violet light he saw one night
when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through Gilman‘s keyhole. He had not dared to peer,
he told Mazurewicz, after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door.
There had been soft talking, too—and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an
inaudible whisper.
Elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping, but supposed
their imaginations had been roused by Gilman‘s late hours and somnolent walking and talking
on the one hand, and by the nearness of traditionally feared May-Eve on the other hand. That
Gilman talked in his sleep was plain, and it was obviously from Desrochers‘ keyhole-listenings
that the delusive notion of the violet dream-light had got abroad. These simple people were
quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about. As for a plan of action—
Gilman had better move down to Elwood‘s room and avoid sleeping alone. Elwood would, if
awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep. Very soon, too, he must see
the specialist. Meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums
and to certain professors; seeking identification and stating that it had been found in a public
rubbish-can. Also, Dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls.
Braced up by Elwood‘s companionship, Gilman attended classes that day. Strange urges still
tugged at him, but he could sidetrack them with considerable success. During a free period he
shewed the queer image to several professors, all of whom were intensely interested, though
none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin. That night he slept on a couch
which Elwood had had the landlord bring to the second-story room, and for the first time in
weeks was wholly free from disquieting dreams. But the feverishness still hung on, and the
whines of the loomfixer were an unnerving influence.
During the next few days Gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid
manifestations. He had, Elwood said, shewed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep; and
meanwhile the landlord was putting rat-poison everywhere. The only disturbing element was
the talk among the superstitious foreigners, whose imaginations had become highly excited.
Mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix, and finally forced one upon him
which he said had been blessed by the good Father Iwanicki. Desrochers, too, had something
to say—in fact, he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above
him on the first and second nights of Gilman‘s absence from it. Paul Choynski thought he
heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night, and claimed that his door had been softly
tried, while Mrs. Dombrowski vowed she had seen Brown Jenkin for the first time since All-
Hallows. But such naive reports could mean very little, and Gilman let the cheap metal crucifix
hang idly from a knob on his host‘s dresser.
For three days Gilman and Elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the
strange spiky image, but always without success. In every quarter, however, interest was
intense; for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity.
One of the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical analysis, and the
result is still talked about in college circles. Professor Ellery found platinum, iron, and tellurium
in the strange alloy; but mixed with these were at least three other apparent elements of high
atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless to classify. Not only did they fail to
correspond with any known element, but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for
probable elements in the periodic system. The mystery remains unsolved to this day, though
the image is on exhibition at the museum of Miskatonic University.
On the morning of April 27 a fresh rat-hole appeared in the room where Gilman was a guest,
but Dombrowski tinned it up during the day. The poison was not having much effect, for
scratchings and scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished. Elwood was out late that
night, and Gilman waited up for him. He did not wish to go to sleep in a room alone—
especially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman
whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams. He wondered who she was,
and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a rubbish-heap at the mouth of a squalid
courtyard. The crone had seemed to notice him and leer evilly at him—though perhaps this
was merely his imagination.
The next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep like logs when night
came. In the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so
completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed Gilman, and speculated about the linkage with
ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable. They spoke of old Keziah
Mason, and Elwood agreed that Gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might
have stumbled on strange and significant information. The hidden cults to which these witches
belonged often guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder, forgotten aeons; and
it was by no means impossible that Keziah had actually mastered the art of passing through
dimensional gates. Tradition emphasises the uselessness of material barriers in halting a
witch‘s motions; and who can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the
night?
Whether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from mathematical research alone,
was still to be seen. Success, Gilman added, might lead to dangerous and unthinkable
situations; for who could foretell the conditions pervading an adjacent but normally
inaccessible dimension? On the other hand, the picturesque possibilities were enormous.
Time could not exist in certain belts of space, and by entering and remaining in such a belt
one might preserve one‘s life and age indefinitely; never suffering organic metabolism or
deterioration except for slight amounts incurred during visits to one‘s own or similar planes.
One might, for example, pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some remote period
of the earth‘s history as young as before.
Whether anybody had ever managed to do this, one could hardly conjecture with any degree
of authority. Old legends are hazy and ambiguous, and in historic times all attempts at
crossing forbidden gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and
messengers from outside. There was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of
hidden and terrible powers—the ―Black Man‖ of the witch-cult, and the ―Nyarlathotep‖ of the
Necronomicon. There was, too, the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or
intermediaries—the quasi-animals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches‘
familiars. As Gilman and Elwood retired, too sleepy to argue further, they heard Joe
Mazurewicz reel into the house half-drunk, and shuddered at the desperate wildness of his
whining prayers.
That night Gilman saw the violet light again. In his dream he had heard a scratching and
gnawing in the partitions, and thought that someone fumbled clumsily at the latch. Then he
saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor.
The beldame‘s face was alight with inhuman exultation, and the little yellow-toothed morbidity
tittered mockingly as it pointed at the heavily sleeping form of Elwood on the other couch
across the room. A paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out. As once before, the hideous
crone seized Gilman by the shoulders, yanking him out of bed and into empty space. Again
the infinitude of the shrieking twilight abysses flashed past him, but in another second he
thought he was in a dark, muddy, unknown alley of foetid odours, with the rotting walls of
ancient houses towering up on every hand.
Ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream, while
from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously. Brown
Jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black
man, which the deep mud largely concealed. There was a dark open doorway on the right, to
which the black man silently pointed. Into this the grimacing crone started, dragging Gilman
after her by his pajama sleeve. There were evil-smelling staircases which creaked ominously,
and on which the old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light; and finally a door leading
off a landing. The crone fumbled with the latch and pushed the door open, motioning to
Gilman to wait and disappearing inside the black aperture.
The youth‘s oversensitive ears caught a hideous strangled cry, and presently the beldame
came out of the room bearing a small, senseless form which she thrust at the dreamer as if
ordering him to carry it. The sight of this form, and the expression on its face, broke the spell.
Still too dazed to cry out, he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud
outside; halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man. As consciousness
departed he heard the faint, shrill tittering of the fanged, rat-like abnormality.
On the morning of the 29th Gilman awaked into a maelstrom of horror. The instant he opened
his eyes he knew something was terribly wrong, for he was back in his old garret room with
the slanting wall and ceiling, sprawled on the now unmade bed. His throat was aching
inexplicably, and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet
and pajama-bottoms were brown with caked mud. For the moment his recollections were
hopelessly hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep-walking. Elwood had
been lost too deeply in slumber to hear and stop him. On the floor were confused muddy
prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door. The more Gilman looked
at them, the more peculiar they seemed; for in addition to those he could recognise as his
there were some smaller, almost round markings—such as the legs of a large chair or table
might make, except that most of them tended to be divided into halves. There were also some
curious muddy rat-tracks leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again. Utter bewilderment
and the fear of madness racked Gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there were
no muddy prints outside. The more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he
felt, and it added to his desperation to hear Joe Mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors
below.
Descending to Elwood‘s room he roused his still-sleeping host and began telling of how he
had found himself, but Elwood could form no idea of what might really have happened. Where
Gilman could have been, how he got back to his room without making tracks in the hall, and
how the muddy, furniture-like prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber, were
wholly beyond conjecture. Then there were those dark, livid marks on his throat, as if he had
tried to strangle himself. He put his hands up to them, but found that they did not even
approximately fit. While they were talking Desrochers dropped in to say that he had heard a
terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours. No, there had been no one on the stairs
after midnight—though just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret, and
cautiously descending steps he did not like. It was, he added, a very bad time of year for
Arkham. The young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix Joe Mazurewicz had
given him. Even the daytime was not safe, for after dawn there had been strange sounds in
the house—especially a thin, childish wail hastily choked off.
Gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix his mind on
his studies. A mood of hideous apprehension and expectancy had seized him, and he
seemed to be awaiting the fall of some annihilating blow. At noon he lunched at the University
Spa, picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert. But he never ate that
dessert; for an item on the paper‘s first page left him limp, wild-eyed, and able only to pay his
check and stagger back to Elwood‘s room.
There had been a strange kidnapping the night before in Orne‘s Gangway, and the two-year-
old child of a clod-like laundry worker named Anastasia Wolejko had completely vanished
from sight. The mother, it appeared, had feared the event for some time; but the reasons she
assigned for her fear were so grotesque that no one took them seriously. She had, she said,
seen Brown Jenkin about the place now and then ever since early in March, and knew from
its grimaces and titterings that little Ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the awful Sabbat
on Walpurgis-Night. She had asked her neighbour Mary Czanek to sleep in the room and try
to protect the child, but Mary had not dared. She could not tell the police, for they never
believed such things. Children had been taken that way every year ever since she could
remember. And her friend Pete Stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of
the way anyhow.
But what threw Gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair of revellers who had
been walking past the mouth of the gangway just after midnight. They admitted they had been
drunk, but both vowed they had seen a crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark
passageway. There had, they said, been a huge robed negro, a little old woman in rags, and a
young white man in his night-clothes. The old woman had been dragging the youth, while
around the feet of the negro a tame rat was rubbing and weaving in the brown mud.
Gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon, and Elwood—who had meanwhile seen the papers
and formed terrible conjectures from them—found him thus when he came home. This time
neither could doubt but that something hideously serious was closing in around them.
Between the phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a monstrous and
unthinkable relationship was crystallising, and only stupendous vigilance could avert still more
direful developments. Gilman must see a specialist sooner or later, but not just now, when all
the papers were full of this kidnapping business.
Just what had really happened was maddeningly obscure, and for a moment both Gilman and
Elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest kind. Had Gilman unconsciously
succeeded better than he knew in his studies of space and its dimensions? Had he actually
slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable? Where—if anywhere—
had he been on those nights of daemoniac alienage? The roaring twilight abysses—the green
hillside—the blistering terrace—the pulls from the stars—the ultimate black vortex—the black
man—the muddy alley and the stairs—the old witch and the fanged, furry horror—the bubble-
congeries and the little polyhedron—the strange sunburn—the wrist wound—the unexplained
image—the muddy feet—the throat-marks—the tales and fears of the superstitious
foreigners—what did all this mean? To what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a
case?
There was no sleep for either of them that night, but next day they both cut classes and
drowsed. This was April 30th, and with the dusk would come the hellish Sabbat-time which all
the foreigners and the superstitious old folk feared. Mazurewicz came home at six o‘clock and
said people at the mill were whispering that the Walpurgis-revels would be held in the dark
ravine beyond Meadow Hill where the old white stone stands in a place queerly void of all
plant-life. Some of them had even told the police and advised them to look there for the
missing Wolejko child, but they did not believe anything would be done. Joe insisted that the
poor young gentleman wear his nickel-chained crucifix, and Gilman put it on and dropped it
inside his shirt to humour the fellow.
Late at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs, lulled by the rhythmical praying of the
loomfixer on the floor below. Gilman listened as he nodded, his preternaturally sharpened
hearing seeming to strain for some subtle, dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient
house. Unwholesome recollections of things in the Necronomicon and the Black Book welled
up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest
ceremonies of the Sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend.
Presently he realised what he was listening for—the hellish chant of the celebrants in the
distant black valley. How did he know so much about what they expected? How did he know
the time when Nahab and her acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow
the black cock and the black goat? He saw that Elwood had dropped asleep, and tried to call
out and waken him. Something, however, closed his throat. He was not his own master. Had
he signed the black man‘s book after all?
Then his fevered, abnormal hearing caught the distant, windborne notes. Over miles of hill
and field and alley they came, but he recognised them none the less. The fires must be lit,
and the dancers must be starting in. How could he keep himself from going? What was it that
had enmeshed him? Mathematics—folklore—the house—old Keziah—Brown Jenkin . . . and
now he saw that there was a fresh rat-hole in the wall near his couch. Above the distant
chanting and the nearer praying of Joe Mazurewicz came another sound—a stealthy,
determined scratching in the partitions. He hoped the electric lights would not go out. Then he
saw the fanged, bearded little face in the rat-hole—the accursed little face which he at last
realised bore such a shocking, mocking resemblance to old Keziah‘s—and heard the faint
fumbling at the door.
The screaming twilight abysses flashed before him, and he felt himself helpless in the
formless grasp of the iridescent bubble-congeries. Ahead raced the small, kaleidoscopic
polyhedron, and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the
vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax.
He seemed to know what was coming—the monstrous burst of Walpurgis-rhythm in whose
cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal, ultimate space-time seethings which lie
behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations
that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the
worlds to certain dreaded periods.
But all this vanished in a second. He was again in the cramped, violet-litten peaked space
with the slanting floor, the low cases of ancient books, the bench and table, the queer objects,
and the triangular gulf at one side. On the table lay a small white figure—an infant boy,
unclothed and unconscious—while on the other side stood the monstrous, leering old woman
with a gleaming, grotesque-hafted knife in her right hand, and a queerly proportioned pale
metal bowl covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral handles in her
left. She was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which Gilman could not understand,
but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in the Necronomicon.
As the scene grew clear he saw the ancient crone bend forward and extend the empty bowl
across the table—and unable to control his own motions, he reached far forward and took it in
both hands, noticing as he did so its comparative lightness. At the same moment the
disgusting form of Brown Jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his
left. The crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the
huge, grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach. The
fanged, furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual, while the witch
croaked loathsome responses. Gilman felt a gnawing, poignant abhorrence shoot through his
mental and emotional paralysis, and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp. A second later
the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a
resounding bell-like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous
deed.
In an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and wrenched the
knife from the old woman‘s claws; sending it clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular
gulf. In another instant, however, matters were reversed; for those murderous claws had
locked themselves tightly around his own throat, while the wrinkled face was twisted with
insane fury. He felt the chain of the cheap crucifix grinding into his neck, and in his peril
wondered how the sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature. Her strength was
altogether superhuman, but as she continued her choking he reached feebly in his shirt and
drew out the metal symbol, snapping the chain and pulling it free.
At sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic, and her grip relaxed long enough to
give Gilman a chance to break it entirely. He pulled the steel-like claws from his neck, and
would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh
access of strength and closed in again. This time he resolved to reply in kind, and his own
hands reached out for the creature‘s throat. Before she saw what he was doing he had the
chain of the crucifix twisted about her neck, and a moment later he had tightened it enough to
cut off her breath. During her last struggle he felt something bite at his ankle, and saw that
Brown Jenkin had come to her aid. With one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge
of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far below.
Whether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know, but he let her rest on the floor where
she had fallen. Then, as he turned away, he saw on the table a sight which nearly snapped
the last thread of his reason. Brown Jenkin, tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of
daemoniac dexterity, had been busy while the witch was throttling him, and his efforts had
been in vain. What he had prevented the knife from doing to the victim‘s chest, the yellow
fangs of the furry blasphemy had done to a wrist—and the bowl so lately on the floor stood full
beside the small lifeless body.
In his dream-delirium Gilman heard the hellish, alien-rhythmed chant of the Sabbat coming
from an infinite distance, and knew the black man must be there. Confused memories mixed
themselves with his mathematics, and he believed his subconscious mind held the angles
which he needed to guide him back to the normal world—alone and unaided for the first time.
He felt sure he was in the immemorially sealed loft above his own room, but whether he could
ever escape through the slanting floor or the long-stopped egress he doubted greatly.
Besides, would not an escape from a dream-loft bring him merely into a dream-house—an
abnormal projection of the actual place he sought? He was wholly bewildered as to the
relation betwixt dream and reality in all his experiences.
The passage through the vague abysses would be frightful, for the Walpurgis-rhythm would
be vibrating, and at last he would have to hear that hitherto veiled cosmic pulsing which he so
mortally dreaded. Even now he could detect a low, monstrous shaking whose tempo he
suspected all too well. At Sabbat-time it always mounted and reached through to the worlds to
summon the initiate to nameless rites. Half the chants of the Sabbat were patterned on this
faintly overheard pulsing which no earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial fulness.
Gilman wondered, too, whether he could trust his instinct to take him back to the right part of
space. How could he be sure he would not land on that green-litten hillside of a far planet, on
the tessellated terrace above the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy, or
in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of Chaos wherein reigns the mindless
daemon-sultan Azathoth?
Just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness. The
witch—old Keziah—Nahab—that must have meant her death. And mixed with the distant
chant of the Sabbat and the whimpers of Brown Jenkin in the gulf below he thought he heard
another and wilder whine from unknown depths. Joe Mazurewicz—the prayers against the
Crawling Chaos now turning to an inexplicably triumphant shriek—worlds of sardonic actuality
impinging on vortices of febrile dream—Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand
Young. . . .
They found Gilman on the floor of his queerly angled old garret room long before dawn, for
the terrible cry had brought Desrochers and Choynski and Dombrowski and Mazurewicz at
once, and had even wakened the soundly sleeping Elwood in his chair. He was alive, and with
open, staring eyes, but seemed largely unconscious. On his throat were the marks of
murderous hands, and on his left ankle was a distressing rat-bite. His clothing was badly
rumpled, and Joe‘s crucifix was missing. Elwood trembled, afraid even to speculate on what
new form his friend‘s sleep-walking had taken. Mazurewicz seemed half-dazed because of a
―sign‖ he said he had had in response to his prayers, and he crossed himself frantically when
the squealing and whimpering of a rat sounded from beyond the slanting partition.
When the dreamer was settled on his couch in Elwood‘s room they sent for Dr. Malkowski—a
local practitioner who would repeat no tales where they might prove embarrassing—and he
gave Gilman two hypodermic injections which caused him to relax in something like natural
drowsiness. During the day the patient regained consciousness at times and whispered his
newest dream disjointedly to Elwood. It was a painful process, and at its very start brought out
a fresh and disconcerting fact.
Gilman—whose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitiveness—was now stone
deaf. Dr. Malkowski, summoned again in haste, told Elwood that both ear-drums were
ruptured, as if by the impact of some stupendous sound intense beyond all human conception
or endurance. How such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours without
arousing all the Miskatonic Valley was more than the honest physician could say.
Elwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper, so that a fairly easy communication was
maintained. Neither knew what to make of the whole chaotic business, and decided it would
be better if they thought as little as possible about it. Both, though, agreed that they must
leave this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged. Evening papers
spoke of a police raid on some curious revellers in a ravine beyond Meadow Hill just before
dawn, and mentioned that the white stone there was an object of age-long superstitious
regard. Nobody had been caught, but among the scattering fugitives had been glimpsed a
huge negro. In another column it was stated that no trace of the missing child Ladislas
Wolejko had been found.
The crowning horror came that very night. Elwood will never forget it, and was forced to stay
out of college the rest of the term because of the resulting nervous breakdown. He had
thought he heard rats in the partitions all the evening, but paid little attention to them. Then,
long after both he and Gilman had retired, the atrocious shrieking began. Elwood jumped up,
turned on the lights, and rushed over to his guest‘s couch. The occupant was emitting sounds
of veritably inhuman nature, as if racked by some torment beyond description. He was
writhing under the bedclothes, and a great red stain was beginning to appear on the blankets.
Elwood scarcely dared to touch him, but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided. By
this time Dombrowski, Choynski, Desrochers, Mazurewicz, and the top-floor lodger were all
crowding into the doorway, and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for Dr.
Malkowski. Everybody shrieked when a large rat-like form suddenly jumped out from beneath
the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by.
When the doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers Walter Gilman was
dead.
It would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed Gilman. There had been
virtually a tunnel through his body—something had eaten his heart out. Dombrowski, frantic at
the failure of his constant rat-poisoning efforts, cast aside all thought of his lease and within a
week had moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in Walnut Street.
The worst thing for a while was keeping Joe Mazurewicz quiet; for the brooding loomfixer
would never stay sober, and was constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible
things.
It seems that on that last hideous night Joe had stooped to look at the crimson rat-tracks
which led from Gilman‘s couch to the nearby hole. On the carpet they were very indistinct, but
a piece of open flooring intervened between the carpet‘s edge and the base-board. There
Mazurewicz had found something monstrous—or thought he had, for no one else could quite
agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the prints. The tracks on the flooring were
certainly vastly unlike the average prints of a rat, but even Choynski and Desrochers would
not admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human hands.
The house was never rented again. As soon as Dombrowski left it the pall of its final
desolation began to descend, for people shunned it both on account of its old reputation and
because of the new foetid odour. Perhaps the ex-landlord‘s rat-poison had worked after all, for
not long after his departure the place became a neighbourhood nuisance. Health officials
traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside the eastern garret room, and agreed
that the number of dead rats must be enormous. They decided, however, that it was not worth
their while to hew open and disinfect the long-sealed spaces; for the foetor would soon be
over, and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious standards. Indeed, there were
always vague local tales of unexplained stenches upstairs in the Witch House just after May-
Eve and Hallowmass. The neighbours grumblingly acquiesced in the inertia—but the foetor
none the less formed an additional count against the place. Toward the last the house was
condemned as an habitation by the building inspector.
Gilman‘s dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been explained. Elwood,
whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening, came back to
college the next autumn and graduated in the following June. He found the spectral gossip of
the town much diminished, and it is indeed a fact that—notwithstanding certain reports of a
ghostly tittering in the deserted house which lasted almost as long as that edifice itself—no
fresh appearances either of old Keziah or of Brown Jenkin have been muttered of since
Gilman‘s death. It is rather fortunate that Elwood was not in Arkham in that later year when
certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers about elder horrors. Of course he heard
about the matter afterward and suffered untold torments of black and bewildered speculation;
but even that was not as bad as actual nearness and several possible sights would have
been.
In March, 1931, a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant Witch House, so
that a chaos of crumbling bricks, blackened, moss-grown shingles, and rotting planks and
timbers crashed down into the loft and broke through the floor beneath. The whole attic story
was choked with debris from above, but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before the
inevitable razing of the decrepit structure. That ultimate step came in the following December,
and it was when Gilman‘s old room was cleared out by reluctant, apprehensive workmen that
the gossip began.
Among the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting ceiling were several
things which made the workmen pause and call in the police. Later the police in turn called in
the coroner and several professors from the university. There were bones—badly crushed
and splintered, but clearly recognisable as human—whose manifestly modern date conflicted
puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only possible lurking-place, the low, slant-
floored loft overhead, had supposedly been sealed from all human access. The coroner‘s
physician decided that some belonged to a small child, while certain others—found mixed
with shreds of rotten brownish cloth—belonged to a rather undersized, bent female of
advanced years. Careful sifting of debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the
collapse, as well as older rat-bones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly
productive of controversy and reflection.
Other objects found included the mingled fragments of many books and papers, together with
a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older books and papers. All, without
exception, appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible forms; and
the evidently recent date of certain items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern
human bones. An even greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed, archaic
writing found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age
differences of at least 150 to 200 years. To some, though, the greatest mystery of all is the
variety of utterly inexplicable objects—objects whose shapes, materials, types of
workmanship, and purposes baffle all conjecture—found scattered amidst the wreckage in
evidently diverse states of injury. One of these things—which excited several Miskatonic
professors profoundly—is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image
which Gilman gave to the college museum, save that it is larger, wrought of some peculiar
bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with
undecipherable hieroglyphics.
Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a
crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found.
Foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel
crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by Joe Mazurewicz
as that which he had given poor Gilman many years before. Some believe this crucifix was
dragged up to the sealed loft by rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in some
corner of Gilman‘s old room all the time. Still others, including Joe himself, have theories too
wild and fantastic for sober credence.
When the slanting wall of Gilman‘s room was torn out, the once sealed triangular space
between that partition and the house‘s north wall was found to contain much less structural
debris, even in proportion to its size, than the room itself; though it had a ghastly layer of older
materials which paralysed the wreckers with horror. In brief, the floor was a veritable ossuary
of the bones of small children—some fairly modern, but others extending back in infinite
gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete. On this deep bony
layer rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, ornate, and exotic
design—above which the debris was piled.
In the midst of this debris, wedged between a fallen plank and a cluster of cemented bricks
from the ruined chimney, was an object destined to cause more bafflement, veiled fright, and
openly superstitious talk in Arkham than anything else discovered in the haunted and
accursed building. This object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge, diseased rat, whose
abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of singular reticence among the
members of Miskatonic‘s department of comparative anatomy. Very little concerning this
skeleton has leaked out, but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the
long, brownish hairs with which it was associated.
The bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a
diminutive monkey than of a rat; while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the
utmost anomalousness, appearing from certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded
parody of a human skull. The workmen crossed themselves in fright when they came upon
this blasphemy, but later burned candles of gratitude in St. Stanislaus‘ Church because of the
shrill, ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again.

The Thing on the Doorstep
(1933)
I.
It is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my best friend, and yet I hope to shew
by this statement that I am not his murderer. At first I shall be called a madman—madder than
the man I shot in his cell at the Arkham Sanitarium. Later some of my readers will weigh each
statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask themselves how I could have believed
otherwise than as I did after facing the evidence of that horror—that thing on the doorstep.
Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have acted on. Even now I ask
myself whether I was misled—or whether I am not mad after all. I do not know—but others
have strange things to tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are at
their wits‘ ends to account for that last terrible visit. They have tried weakly to concoct a theory
of a ghastly jest or warning by discharged servants, yet they know in their hearts that the truth
is something infinitely more terrible and incredible.
So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged him, and in so doing
purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed untold terrors on all mankind.
There are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul
breaks a passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike before
reckoning the consequences.
I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior, he was so precocious
that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I sixteen. He was the most
phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre,
fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his
private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering.
An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them
to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and
seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a
strange, secretive inner life in the boy, with imagination as his one avenue of freedom.
At any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his facile writings such as to
captivate me despite my greater age. About that time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat
grotesque cast, and I found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind our
joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient, mouldering, and subtly
fearsome town in which we lived—witch-cursed, legend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled,
sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside
the darkly muttering Miskatonic.
As time went by I turned to architecture and gave up my design of illustrating a book of
Edward‘s daemoniac poems, yet our comradeship suffered no lessening. Young Derby‘s odd
genius developed remarkably, and in his eighteenth year his collected nightmare-lyrics made
a real sensation when issued under the title Azathoth and Other Horrors. He was a close
correspondent of the notorious Baudelairean poet Justin Geoffrey, who wrote The People of
the Monolith and died screaming in a madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister, ill-regarded
village in Hungary.
In self-reliance and practical affairs, however, Derby was greatly retarded because of his
coddled existence. His health had improved, but his habits of childish dependence were
fostered by overcareful parents; so that he never travelled alone, made independent
decisions, or assumed responsibilities. It was early seen that he would not be equal to a
struggle in the business or professional arena, but the family fortune was so ample that this
formed no tragedy. As he grew to years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of
boyishness. Blond and blue-eyed, he had the fresh complexion of a child; and his attempts to
raise a moustache were discernible only with difficulty. His voice was soft and light, and his

pequenos e crescem, fundindo-se com outras formações
menores... – Ele tocou
outro interruptor. – Há cerca de quatro horas – e uma
coluna vertical branca apareceu bem no meio do display
– isto saiu lá dentro. Ou entrou lá dentro. – Os cubos
coloridos, esferas e pirâmides tinham se realinhado
instantaneamente para dar espaço para a coluna branca;
ela os tornava realmente pequenos, sua extremidade
superior cortada suavemente pelo limite vertical do
display. – O
desgraçado é maior do que qualquer outra coisa – disse
Tick, com uma certa satisfação – e ninguém sabe o que
é, ou a quem pertence.
– Mas alguém deve saber – disse Kumiko.
– É lógico, sim. Mas as pessoas na minha linha de
trabalho, e há milhões de nós, não têm sido
capazes de descobrir. O que é ainda mais estranho, de
certa forma, do que o fato de que aquela coisa está lá,
para começar. Já estive por toda a grade, antes de você
chegar, procurando qualquer jóquei que tivesse uma
pista. Nada. Nada mesmo.– Como pode esta 3Jane estar morta? – Mas ela se
lembrou do Fin, das caixas no escritório de
seu pai. – Tenho que contar para Sally.
– Nada a fazer senão esperar – disse ele. – Ela
provavelmente vai ligar. Enquanto isso, temos que
acessar essa pequena AI caríssima que você tem aí, se
quiser.
– Sim – disse ela –, obrigada.
– Só espero que aqueles caras do Special Branch
comprados por Swain não te localizem aqui.
Ainda assim, nós só podemos esperar...
– Sim – disse Kumiko, nada satisfeita com a ideia de
esperar.

A GUERRA DA FÁBRICA
Cherry encontrou-o mais uma vez com o Juiz, lá embaixo,
no escuro. Ele estava sentando sobre
um dos Investigadores com uma lanterna na mão,
iluminando o revestimento de ferrugem polida do
Juiz. Não se lembrava de ter chegado ali, mas não podia
sentir a confusão residual do Korsakov.
Lembrava os olhos da garota, naquela sala que Bobby
disse ser Londres.
– Gentry plugou o Conde e sua caixa num console de
ciberespaço – disse Cherry. – Você sabiadisso?
Slick concordou com a cabeça, ainda olhando para cima,
para o Juiz. – Bobby disse que era melhor fazermos isso.
– Mas o que está acontecendo? O que aconteceu quando
vocês dois entraram lá?
– Gentry e Bobby se entenderam bem rápido. Dois loucos
do mesmo jeito. Quando nos
plugamos, saímos em algum lugar em órbita, mas Bobby
não estava lá... Em seguida, foi o México,
acho. Quem é Tally Isham?
– Rainha do stim quando eu era pequena. Como a Angie
Mitchell é agora.
– Mitchell, era a namorada dele.
– De quem?
– Bobby. Ele estava contando a Gentry sobre isso, em
Londres.
– Londres?
– Sim. Fomos para lá, depois do México.
– E ele disse que era o namorado de Angie Mitchell?
Parece loucura.
– Sim, mas ele disse que foi assim que entrou nessa, no
tal aleph. – Ele virou a luz para baixo e direcionou-a para
o esqueleto das mandíbulas de aço do Triturador de
Cadáveres. – Ele estava andando com pessoas ricas e
ouviu falar a respeito. Chamou de apanhador de almas.Os donos da coisa alugavam tempo lá dentro para essas
pessoas ricas. Bobby experimentou uma vez, depois
voltou e roubou-o. Levou para a Cidade do México e
começou a passar todo o tempo lá. Mas eles foram atrás
dele...
– Parece que você está se lembrando das coisas, de
qualquer maneira.
– Então ele saiu fora. Foi para Cleveland e fez um acordo
com Afrika, deu dinheiro para Afrika
escondê-lo, cuidar dele enquanto estava “wirehead”,
porque ele estava bem perto...
– Perto do quê?
– Não sei. Alguma coisa bizarra. Como quando Gentry
fala sobre a Forma.
– Certo – disse ela. – Mas agora acho que isso pode matá-
lo, ficar plugado daquele jeito. Seus
sinais estão começando a se deteriorar. Ele tem estado
naquele equipamento intravenoso por tempo
demais. Foi por isso que vim procurar você.
As entranhas dentadas de aço do Triturador cintilavam no
raio de luz da lanterna. – É o que ele
quer. De qualquer maneira, se ele pagou o Kid, é como
se você estivesse trabalhando para ele. Mas, aqueles
caras que o Bird viu hoje, eles estão trabalhando para o
pessoal de Los Angeles, os mesmos de quem o Bobby
roubou a coisa...– Me conta uma coisa.
– O quê?
– O que são essas coisas que você constrói? Afrika me
disse que você era um branquelo doido
que construía robôs com peças de ferro-velho. Disse que
no verão você os coloca lá fora e encena
grandes lutas...
– Não são robôs – interrompeu ele, balançando a lanterna
para baixo, para os braços com garras da Bruxa de
pernas de aranha. – São controlados por rádio.
– Você os constrói apenas para destruí-los então?
– Não. Mas tenho que testá-los. Ver se montei tudo
certo... – Desligou a lanterna.
– Branquelo doido – disse ela. – Você tem alguma garota
por aqui?
– Não.
– Tome um banho. Faça a barba... – De repente, ela
estava muito próxima dele, o hálito dela em
seu rosto.
– Ok, pessoal, ouçam bem...
– Que merda...
– ...porque não vou repetir isso.Slick estava tapando a boca de Cherry com sua mão em
seguida.
– Nós queremos seu convidado e todo o seu
equipamento. E isso significa tudo, repito, todo o
equipamento. – A voz amplificada ressoava através da
estrutura de ferro da Fábrica. – Vocês podem entregá-lo
para nós, o que é bem simples, ou podemos
simplesmente matar todo mundo. O que também será
simples para nós. Cinco minutos para vocês pensarem.
Cherry mordeu sua mão.
– Merda, eu tenho que respirar, ok?
Então ele estava correndo pela escuridão da Fábrica e a
ouviu chamar seu nome.
***
Uma única lâmpada de cem watts brilhava acima do
portão sul da Fábrica, um par de portas retorcidas de
aço, abertas e congeladas nessa posição pela ferrugem.
Bird deve ter deixado a luz acesa. De onde estava
agachado, perto de uma janela sem vidro, Slick podia
apenas identificar o hover, lá fora, pouco além da área
iluminada. O homem com o megafone veio caminhando,
saindo
da escuridão, com uma tranquilidade calculada para
indicar que estava no comando. Ele vestia um macacão
de trabalho camuflado, com um capuz fino de nylon
apertado ao redor de sua cabeça e óculos protetores.
Ergueu o megafone. – Três minutos. – Fazia com que Slick
se lembrasse dos guardas na penitenciária, na segunda
vez em que esteve preso por roubar carros.Gentry devia estar observando tudo lá de cima, onde um
estreito painel vertical de plexiglas
estava grudado na parede, bem sobre os portões da
Fábrica.
Alguma coisa se esgueirou no escuro, à direita de Slick.
Virou-se a tempo de ver Bird na luz fraca da abertura de
uma outra janela, talvez uns oito metros distante de
onde ele estava, e o brilho do silenciador de amálgama
de metal porque o garoto estava com o rifle calibre 22. –
Bird! Não... – Um ponto vermelho surgiu na bochecha de
Bird, denunciando uma mira laser vinda de fora de
Solitude.
Bird foi jogado para o fundo da Fábrica enquanto o som
do tiro rasgava pelas janelas vazias e ecoava pelas
paredes. Depois ouviu-se apenas o silenciador, rolando
pelo concreto.
– Foda-se – o vozeirão rugiu animadamente. – Vocês
tiveram sua chance. – Slick espiou por cima da borda da
janela e viu o homem correndo de volta para o hover.
Quantos deles estariam lá fora? Bird não tinha dito. Dois
hovers, o Honda. Dez? Mais? A menos
que Gentry tivesse uma pistola escondida em algum
lugar, o rifle de Bird era a única arma deles.
As turbinas do hover foram ligadas. Ele achou que iriam
apenas avançar direto para dentro da
Fábrica.
Tinham
miras
infravermelho, também.
laser
e
provavelmenteEntão ouviu um dos Investigadores, pelo som que fazia
com suas esteiras rolantes de aço inoxidável no chão de
concreto. Veio rastejando, saindo do escuro, com seu
ferrão de escorpião em termita inclinado bem baixo. O
chassis tinha começado sua vida, cinquenta anos antes,
como um manipulador remoto destinado a lidar com
vazamentos tóxicos e limpeza de usinas nucleares. Slick
tinha encontrado três unidades desmontadas em Newark
e trocou um Volkswagen por elas.
Gentry. Ele havia deixado sua unidade de controle lá em
cima, no loft.
O Investigador abriu caminho e parou na abertura ampla
da porta, encarando Solitude e o hover
que avançava. Era mais ou menos do tamanho de uma
grande motocicleta, seu chassis aberto, composto por
um amplo feixe de motores auxiliares, tanques de
compressão, engrenagens expostas,
cilindros hidráulicos. Um par de garras de aparência cruel
se estendia a cada lado de seu conjunto modesto de
instrumentos. Slick não tinha certeza de onde eram
aquelas garras, talvez algum tipo de grande máquina
agrícola.
O hover era um modelo industrial pesado. Lâminas de
blindagem de plástico grosso e cinza haviam sido
afixadas sobre o para-brisa e as janelas, pequenas
fendas para visão centradas em cada lâmina.
O Investigador se moveu, suas esteiras de aço
espalhando gelo e concreto solto enquanto avançava em
direção ao hover, suas garras na extensão máxima. O
motorista do hover deu marcha àré, lutando contra o momento linear.
As garras do Investigador golpearam furiosamente a
saliência da saia pneumática, retrocederam
e golpearam novamente. A saia era reforçada com uma
rede de policarbonato. Então Gentry lembrou-se da lança
de termita. Ela se incendiou em uma bola condensada de
luz branca e chicoteou por cima das garras inutilizadas,
mergulhando em direção à saia e cortando-a como uma
faca furando papelão. As esteiras do Investigador
giravam enquanto Gentry as guiava contra a bolsa de ar
que se esvaziava, a lança projetada em sua extensão
máxima. Slick percebeu, de repente, que estava
gritando, mas não sabia o que tinha dito. Estava de pé
agora, enquanto as garras finalmente encontravam uma
abertura no canto rasgado da saia do hover.
Jogou-se no chão novamente quando uma
encapuzada, de óculos, surgiu numa abertura
figura
no teto do hover como um fantoche armado, esvaziando
um pente de projéteis calibre doze que geravam faíscas
ao se chocar contra o Investigador, que continuava a
mastigar seu caminho através da saia pneumática, o
contorno iluminado pela pulsação branca da lança. O
Investigador parou, as garras presas fortemente na bolsa
desgastada; o atirador mergulhou de volta em sua
escotilha.
Linha de alimentação? Conjunto de servomotores? O que
o cara tinha acertado? A pulsação branca estava
diminuindo agora, quase morta.
O hover começou a retroceder, devagar, de volta através
da ferrugem, levando o Investigadorcom ele.
Estava bem longe, fora da luz, visível apenas porque
estava se movendo, quando Gentry descobriu a
combinação de interruptores que ativava o lança-
chamas, seu bocal montado abaixo do
ponto de junção das garras. Slick observou, fascinado,
quando o Investigador acendeu dez litros de gasolina
misturada com detergente, um spray prolongado de alta
pressão. Tinha conseguido aquele
bocal, lembrou-se, em um trator de pesticidas.
Funcionou bem.

O APANHADOR DE ALMAS
O hover dirigia-se para o sul quando Mamman Brigitte
apareceu novamente. A mulher com os
olhos prateados abandonou o sedan cinza num outro
estacionamento e a putinha com o rosto de Angie contou
uma história confusa: Cleveland, Flórida, alguém que
havia sido seu namorado, ou gigolô, ou ambos...
Mas Angie tinha ouvido a voz de Brigitte, na cabine do
helicóptero, no telhado do New Suzuki
Envoy: Confie nela, criança. Nisto, ela cumpre o desejo
dos loa.
Prisioneira em seu assento, a fivela do cinto de
segurança envolta por um sólido bloco de plástico, Angie
havia observado quando a mulher passou por cima dosistema de computadores do helicóptero e ativou um
sistema de emergência que permitia pilotagem manual.
E agora esta autoestrada na chuva de inverno, a garota
falando de novo, por sobre o silvo dos
limpadores de para-brisa.
***
No brilho das velas, paredes de pedra caiada, mariposas
flutuando nos galhos rastejantes dos salgueiros.
Seu momento se aproxima.
E ali estavam eles, os Cavaleiros, os loa: Papa Legba,
brilhante e fluido como mercúrio; Ezili
Freda, que é mãe e rainha; Samedi, o Senhor dos
Cemitérios, musgo sobre ossos corroídos; Similor;
Madame Travaux; muitos outros... Eles preenchem o
vazio que é Grande Brigitte. O murmúrio de suas vozes é
o som do vento, água corrente, a colmeia...
Eles se contorcem acima do chão como o calor sobre
uma autoestrada no verão e nunca antes
foi assim, para Angie, nunca esta gravidade, esta
sensação de queda, este grau de renúncia...
Para um lugar onde Legba fala, a voz dele como o som
de um tambor de ferro...
Ele conta uma história.
No vendaval de imagens, Angie assiste à evolução da
inteligência das máquinas: círculos de pedra, relógios,
teares a vapor, uma floresta metálica ruidosa deengrenagens e escapamentos, o vácuo preso no vidro
soprado, o brilho ígneo através de filamentos tão finos
quanto um fio de cabelo, vastas estruturas de válvulas
eletrônicas e interruptores, decodificando mensagens
criptografadas por outras máquinas... As frágeis válvulas
de curta duração se compactaram, tornaram-se
transistores; circuitos se integraram, compactaram-se
em silício...
O silício se aproximou de certos limites funcionais...
E ela está de volta ao vídeo de Becker, a história dos
Tessier-Ashpools, entrecortada por sonhos
que são as memórias de 3Jane, e continua falando,
Legba, e a história é uma história, incontáveis teias
entrelaçadas em torno de um núcleo comum, escondido:
a mãe de 3Jane criando as inteligências gêmeas que um
dia se unificarão, a chegada de estranhos (e de repente
Angie tomou consciência de
que conhece Molly, também, dos sonhos), a união das
AIs, a loucura de 3Jane...
E Angie se viu encarando uma cabeça cravada de pedras
preciosas, uma coisa moldada em platina e pérola e
delicada joia azul, olhos de rubi sintético entalhado. Ela
conhece isso de seus sonhos que nunca foram sonhos:
este é o portal para os núcleos de dados de Tessier-
Ashpool, onde
as duas metades de algo lutavam entre si, esperando
nascer como uma só.
– Neste tempo, você não havia nascido. – A voz da
cabeça é a voz de Marie-France, a mãe mortade 3Jane, sua conhecida de tantas noites assombradas,
embora Angie saiba que é Brigitte quem fala: –
Seu pai estava apenas começando a enfrentar seus
próprios limites, a distinguir ambição de talento.
Aquele para quem ele deveria entregar sua criança ainda
não havia se manifestado. Logo o homem
Case iria realizar aquela união, porquanto
porquanto atemporal. Mas você sabe isso.
breve,
– Onde Legba está agora?
– Legba-ati-Bon, como você o conhece, aguarda para ser.
– Não – lembrando-se das palavras de Beauvoir há muito
tempo, em Nova Jersey –, os loa vieram da África, nos
primórdios...
– Não como você os conheceu. Quando o momento
chegou, a hora iluminada, havia unidade absoluta, uma
consciência. Mas havia o outro.
– O outro?
– Falo somente do que eu conheci. Apenas o que foi Um
conheceu o outro, e aquele que foi Um
não mais existe. No despertar daquele conhecimento, o
centro falhou; cada fragmento se distanciou.
Os fragmentos procuraram forma, cada um, como é a
natureza de tais coisas. Dentre todos os sinais que a sua
espécie armazenou para defender-se da noite, naquela
situação os paradigmas do vodu se
mostraram os mais apropriados.– Então Bobby estava certo. Foi Quando Isso Mudou...
– Sim, ele estava certo, mas somente num sentido,
porque eu sou ao mesmo tempo Legba e Brigitte, e um
aspecto daquilo que barganhei com seu pai. O que
requisitou a ele que desenhasse veves em sua cabeça.
– E disse a ele que o precisava saber para aperfeiçoar o
biochip?
– O biochip era necessário.
– É necessário que eu sonhe as memórias da filha de
Ashpool?
– Talvez.
– Os sonhos são um resultado da droga?
– Não diretamente, embora a droga tenha feito com que
você se tornasse mais receptiva para algumas
modalidades, e menos para outras.
– A droga, então. O que era? Qual era o seu propósito?
– Uma resposta neuroquímica detalhada
primeira questão seria muito longa.
para
sua
– Qual era o seu propósito?
– No que diz respeito a você?
Ela teve de desviar o olhar dos olhos de rubi. A câmara é
revestida com painéis de madeira antiga, encerada até
brilhar. O chão está recoberto com um carpete sob
medida, tecido com diagramas de circuitos.– Nunca houve dois lotes idênticos. A única constante era
a substância cuja assinatura psicotrópica você
compreendia como “a droga”. No curso da ingestão,
muitas outras substâncias estavam envolvidas, bem
como várias dúzias de nanomecanismos subcelulares,
programados para reestruturar as alterações sinápticas
efetuadas por Christopher Mitchell...
Os veves de seu pai foram alterados, parcialmente
apagados, redesenhados...
– Por ordem de quem?
Os olhos de rubi. Pérola e lazurita. Silêncio.
– Por ordem de quem? De Hilton? Foi Hilton?
– A decisão originou-se de Continuidade. Quando você
voltou da Jamaica, Continuidade
aconselhou Swift a reintroduzi-la à droga. Piper Hill
tentou cumprir as ordens dele.
Ela sentiu uma pressão se acumulando em sua cabeça,
pontos gêmeos de dor por trás de seus olhos...
– Hilton Swift é obrigado a implementar as decisões da
Continuidade. Sense/Net é uma entidade
complexa demais para sobreviver de outra forma, e
Continuidade, criada muito depois da hora iluminada, é
de uma outra ordem. A tecnologia de biosoft que seu pai
criou
trouxe
Continuidade
para
a
existência.
Continuidade é ingênua.
– Por quê? Por que Continuidade quis que eu fizesse
aquilo?– Continuidade é Continuidade. Continuidade é o trabalho
de Continuidade...
– Mas quem envia os sonhos?
– Eles não são enviados. Você é atraída para eles, assim
como uma vez você foi atraída para os
loa. A tentativa de Continuidade de reescrever a
mensagem de seu pai falhou. Algum impulso que é, de
fato, seu permitiu que escapasse. O coup-poudre falhou.
– Foi Continuidade que enviou a mulher para me
sequestrar?
– As motivações de Continuidade estão fechadas para
mim. É de uma outra ordem. Continuidade
permitiu a subversão de Robin Lanier pelos agentes de
3Jane.
– Mas por quê?
E a dor era impossível.
***
– O nariz dela está sangrando – disse a garota da rua. – O
que eu faço?
– Limpe. Faça-a se recostar. Merda. Dê um jeito...
– O que foi isso que ela disse sobre Nova Jersey?
– Cala a boca. Apenas cala a boca. Procure por uma
saída.
– Por quê?– Nós vamos para Nova Jersey.
Sangue no seu novo casaco de pele. Kelly iria ficar
furiosa.

GROUS
Tick removeu o pequeno painel da parte traseira da
unidade Maas-Neotek usando um palito de
dente e um alicate de ourives.
– Lindo – murmurou, espiando dentro da abertura através
de lentes iluminadas, sua cascata de
cabelo oleoso balançando sobre ela. – O modo como
ajustaram os condutores, partindo deste interruptor.
Espertos pra cacete...
– Tick – disse Kumiko –, você conhecia a Sally quando ela
chegou a Londres?
– Foi logo em seguida, acho... – Pegou um cilindro de
cabo óptico. – Porque ela não era muito
importante, naquela época...
– Você gosta dela?
O vidro iluminado levantou-se para piscar em sua
direção, o olho esquerdo de Tick, distorcido
por trás. – Se gosto dela? Acho que nunca pensei nisso,
não dessa forma.
– Você não desgosta dela?– É difícil de lidar, a Sally. Entende o que eu digo?
– Difícil?
– Nunca compreendeu direito como as coisas são feitas
por aqui. Sempre reclamando. – Suas mãos moveram-se
rapidamente, com segurança: o alicate, o cabo óptico... –
É um lugar tranquilo, aqui na Inglaterra. Nem sempre foi
assim, claro: tivemos problemas, depois a guerra... As
coisas se movem, aqui, de um certo modo, entende o
que eu digo? Embora você não possa dizer o mesmo em
relação ao pessoal “turbinado”.
– Como?
– Swain, aquele pessoal. Embora o pessoal do seu pai, de
quem Swain sempre foi tão próximo,
pareça ter uma consideração pela tradição... É preciso
ocupar um certo lugar, entender como é isso...
Sabe como é? Agora, este novo negócio que Swain está
fazedo, ele pode complicar as coisas para qualquer um
que não esteja bem perto, ou não faça parte do
esquema. Deus, ainda temos um governo
aqui. As coisas não são comandadas pelas grandes
corporações. Bem, não diretamente...
– As atividades de Swain ameaçam o governo?
– Ele está mudando tudo. Redistribuindo o poder como é
mais conveniente para ele mesmo.
Informação. Poder. Dados nus e crus. Concentre isso nas
mãos de um único homem... – Um músculode sua bochecha contorcia-se enquanto ele falava.
Agora, a unidade de Colin estava em uma superfície de
plástico branco antiestática sobre a mesa de café; Tick
estava conectando os condutores que se projetavam dela
em um cabo mais grosso que corria para uma das pilhas
de módulos. – Aqui
está – disse ele, esfregando as mãos. – Não consigo
projetá-lo aqui na sala para você, mas vamos acessá-lo
através de um console. Já viu o ciberespaço, não?
– Apenas nos stims.
– É como se tivesse visto, então. De toda forma, vai ver
agora. – Levantou-se; ela o seguiu pela
sala para um par de cadeiras excessivamente estofadas,
com camurça sintética, que rodeavam uma mesa baixa e
quadrada de vidro negro. – Wireless – disse ele,
orgulhosamente, pegando duas unidades de trodos na
mesa e passando uma para Kumiko. – Custam os olhos
da cara.
Kumiko examinou a tiara negra opaca. O logo Maas-
Neotek estava moldado entre os dois contatos da
têmpora. Ela a colocou, fria contra a sua pele. Ele
colocou sua própria unidade, recostou-se na cadeira à
frente de Kumiko. – Pronta?
– Sim – disse ela, e a sala de Tick desapareceu, suas
paredes uma agitação de cartas, caindo e
recuando, contra a grade brilhante, as formas de dados
se erguendo.
– Transição legal esta – ouviu-o dizer. – Foi colocada
dentro dos trodos, quero dizer. Para acrescentar umpouco de efeito...
– Onde está Colin?
– Só um segundo... Deixa eu dar um jeito nisso...
Kumiko respirou profundamente enquanto disparava em
direção a uma planície de luz amarelo-
cromo.
– Vertigem pode ser um problema – disse Tick, e ele
estava abruptamente ao lado dela, na planície amarela.
Ela olhou para baixo, para seus sapatos de camurça,
depois para suas próprias mãos. – Um pouco de imagem
corporal vai dar conta disso.
– Ora, ora – disse Colin –, é o carinha do Rose and Crown.
Andou mexendo na minha unidade,
não é?
Kumiko virou-se e encontrou-o lá, as solas de suas botas
marrons dez centímetros acima do amarelo-cromo. No
ciberespaço, percebeu, não havia sombras.
– Não sabia que já tínhamos nos encontrado – disse Tick.
– Não se preocupe – disse Colin –, não fomos
apresentados formalmente. Mas – disse para Kumiko – eu
acredito que você achou o caminho, em segurança, para
a peculiar Brixton.
– Cristo! – disse Tick. – Você é meio arrogante, não?
– Desculpe-me – disse Colin, sorrindo. – Fui projetado
para atender às expectativas da visitante.– Você não é nada mais que a ideia de um designer
japonês sobre um inglês!
– Havia Dráculas – disse ela – no metrô. Levaram minha
bolsa. Queriam levar você...
– Você se desprendeu de seu envoltório, cara – disse Tick.
– No momento, está plugado ao meu
console.
Colin fez uma careta. – Valeu.
– Vou te dizer outra coisa – disse Tick, dando um passo
em direção a Colin. – Os dados que estão aí dentro foram
mexidos, no que diz respeito ao que você deveria ser. –
Olhou para ele com intensidade. – Um amigo meu em
Birmingham acabou de entregar você. – Virou-se para
Kumiko. –
Esse Sr. Chips aqui, andaram mexendo nele. Sabia disso?
– Não...
– Para ser totalmente sincero – disse Colin, jogando sua
franja para trás –, eu já suspeitava disso.
Tick ficou olhando para o vazio, para a matrix, como se
estivesse escutando algo que Kumiko
não podia ouvir. – Sim – disse ele, finalmente –, embora
esteja quase certo de que foi um trabalho de fábrica. Dez
dos teus blocos principais. – Ele riu. – Cobriram tudo com
ICE... Você deveria saber absolutamente qualquer merda
sobre Shakespeare, não?– Desculpe – disse Colin –, mas creio que
absolutamente qualquer merda sobre Shakespeare.
sei
– Bom, queremos ouvir um soneto, então – disse Tick,
seu rosto se contorcendo numa piscada
em câmera lenta.
Algo similar a pavor cruzou o rosto de Colin. – Você está
certo.
– Quer tentar Dickens? – disse Tick, entusiasmado.
– Mas eu sei...
– Você pensa que sabe, até que te perguntem algo
específico! Veja, os caras deixaram esses vazios, nas
partes sobre literatura inglesa, e preencheram com outra
coisa...
– O que colocaram?
– Não sei dizer – respondeu Tick. – O cara em
Birmingham não consegue passar. Bem esperto,
ele, mas você é um maldito biosoft da Maas...
– Tick – interrompeu Kumiko –, há algum jeito de contatar
a Sally pela matrix?
– Duvido, mas podemos tentar. Você vai ver aquela
macroforma que eu te mostrei antes, de qualquer
maneira. Quer que Sr. Chips venha junto?
– Sim, por favor...
– Ok – disse Tick, depois hesitou. – Mas não sabemos o
que está armazenado dentro de seu amigo aqui. Algumacoisa pela qual seu pai pagou, eu presumo.
– Ele está certo – disse Colin.
– Todos nós vamos – disse ela.
***
Tick transitou em tempo real, era melhor do que aplicar
as mudanças incorpóreas e instantâneas
geralmente empregadas na matrix.
A planície amarela, explicou, cobria a Bolsa de Valores de
Londres e outras instituições relacionadas à City, o centro
financeiro. De algum modo, ele gerou um tipo de barco
para transportá-
los, uma abstração azul com a intenção de reduzir a
possibilidade de vertigem. Enquanto o barco azul
navegava para longe da Bolsa de Valores, Kumiko olhava
para trás e observava o vasto cubo amarelo
retrocedendo. Tick estava apontando para várias
estruturas, como um guia de turismo; Colin, sentado ao
lado dela com as pernas cruzadas, parecia estar se
divertindo com a inversão de papéis. – Aquele é o White’s
– Tick estava falando, direcionando a atenção para uma
modesta pirâmide cinza –, o clube em Saint James.
Registro de associados, lista de espera...
Kumiko contemplou a arquitetura do ciberespaço,
ouvindo a voz de seu tutor francês bilíngue
em Tóquio, explicando a necessidade da humanidade por
este espaço de informação. Ícone, pontos de referência,
realidades artificiais... Mas isso tudo junto ficavaembaçado, na memória, como essas formas verticais,
enquanto Tick acelerava...

Inicialmente, parecia a Kumiko como o céu, mas agora,
olhando para ela, sentiu-se como se fosse alguma coisa
que pudesse pegar na mão, um cilindro de pérola
luminosa do tamanho de uma
peça de xadrez. Mas ela apequenava as
policromáticas que se agrupavam ao seu redor.
formas
– Bem – disse Colin, alegre –, isto é realmente peculiar,
não é? Uma anomalia completa, singularidade total...
– Mas você não tem que se preocupar com isso, não é? –
disse Tick.
– Somente se não estiver interferindo diretamente na
situação de Kumiko – concordou Colin, levantando-se na
forma-barco –, embora ninguém possa ter certeza.
– Você tem que tentar contatar Sally – disse Kumiko,
impacientemente. Aquela coisa – a macroforma, a
anomalia – não despertava nela interesse algum, embora
tanto Tick quanto Colin se
referissem a ela como extraordinária.
– Olha para ela – disse Tick. – Poderia ter um mundo
inteiro lá dentro...– E você não sabe o que é? – Ela estava observando Tick;
ele tinha um olhar distante que significava que suas
mãos estavam se mexendo, lá em Brixton, operando seu
console.
– É uma quantidade muito grande de dados – disse Colin.
– Tentei estabelecer uma conexão com
constructo, o que ela chama de Fin – disse Tick,
aquele
seus olhos voltando ao foco, uma ponta de preocupação
em sua voz –, mas não consegui acessá-lo.
Tive a impressão de que alguma coisa estava lá,
esperando... Acho melhor sairmos agora...
Um ponto negro, na curva da pérola, suas extremidades
perfeitamente definidas...
– Mas que merda – disse Tick.
– Corta a conexão – disse Colin.
– Não consigo! Pegou a gente...
Kumiko observava enquanto a forma de barco azul
debaixo de seus pés se alongava,
estendendo-se numa corrente azul-celeste, puxada
através do abismo para dentro da mancha arredondada
de escuridão. E então, num instante de puro
estranhamento, ela também, junto com Tick e Colin, foi
puxada para uma delicada magreza...
***
Para se encontrar em Ueno Park, numa tarde de final de
outono, à beira das águas plácidas dolago Shinobazu, sua mãe sentada ao seu lado num banco
polido e frio de laminado de carbono, mais
lindo agora do que na sua memória. Os lábios de sua
mãe eram cheios e ricamente cobertos de brilho,
delineados, Kumiko sabia, com os pincéis mais estreitos e
mais finos. Ela vestia sua jaqueta preta francesa, com o
colarinho de pele preta emoldurando seu sorriso de boas-
vindas.
Kumiko pôde apenas olhar, contraída ao redor do bulbo
gelado de medo sob seu coração.
– Você tem sido uma garota tola, Kumi – disse sua mãe. –
Imaginou que eu não me lembraria de
você, ou iria abandoná-la no inverno de Londres e com os
gângsteres que servem ao seu pai?
Kumiko observava os lábios perfeitos, entreabertos sobre
os dentes brancos; dentes cuidados, ela sabia, pelo
melhor dentista de Tóquio. – Você está morta – ouviu a si
mesma dizer.
– Não – respondeu sua mãe, sorrindo –, não agora. Não
aqui, em Ueno Park. Olhe os grous, Kumi.
Mas Kumiko não queria virar sua cabeça.
– Olhe os grous.
– Vá se foder – disse Tick, e Kumiko virou-se para vê-lo,
seu rosto pálido e contorcido, coberto
de suor, seus cachos oleosos grudados em sua testa.
– Eu sou a mãe dela.– Não é sua mãe, entendeu? – Tick estava tremendo, seu
esqueleto retorcido tremendo como se
forçado contra um vento terrível. – Não... é... sua... mãe...
– Havia manchas escuras sob as axilas do terno cinza.
Seus pulsos pequenos se sacudiam enquanto ele lutava
para dar mais um passo.
– Você está doente – disse a mãe de Kumiko, em tom de
preocupação. – Você deve se deitar.
Tick caiu de joelhos, forçado para baixo por um peso
invisível. – Pare! – gritou Kumiko.
Alguma coisa bateu no rosto de Tick fazendo cair sobre o
concreto pastel do caminho.
– Pare!
O braço esquerdo de Tick disparou direto de seu ombro e
começou a girar devagar, a mão ainda fechada num
punho branco, cerrado. Kumiko ouviu alguma coisa
ceder, osso ou ligamento, e
Tick gritou.
Sua mãe riu.
Kumiko bateu no rosto de sua mãe, e dor, aguda e real,
percorreu seu braço.
O rosto de sua mãe tremeluziu, transformou-se num
outro rosto. Um rosto gaijin, com lábios largos e um nariz
afilado.
Tick berrou.– Bem – Kumiko ouviu Colin dizer –, isso é interessante. –
Ela virou-se para ele lá, montando
num dos cavalos da pintura de caça, uma representação
estilizada de um animal extinto, seu pescoço curvado
graciosamente enquanto ele troteava na direção deles. –
Desculpe, levou um tempo para encontrar você. Esta é
uma estrutura maravilhosamente complexa. Um tipo de
universo de bolso. Um
pouco de tudo, na verdade. – O cavalo avançou à frente
deles.
– Brinquedo – disse a coisa com o rosto da mãe de
Kumiko –, você se atreve a falar comigo?
– Sim, na verdade me atrevo. Você é Lady 3Jane Tessier-
Ashpool, ou melhor, a falecida Lady 3Jane Tessier-
Ashpool, falecida há um bom tempo, antigamente
vivendo na Villa Straylight. Esta representação bastante
bonita de um parque em Tóquio foi algo que você acabou
de tirar das memórias de Kumiko, não foi?
– Morra! – Ela sacudiu uma mão branca da qual surgiu
uma forma em neon.
– Não – disse Colin, e o grou estilhaçou-se, seus
fragmentos passando através dele, cacos fantasmas
caindo ao longe. – Não funciona. Lamento. Lembrei-me o
que sou. Encontrei os vazios que eles esconderam nos
slots para Shakespeare e Thackeray e Blake. Fui
modificado para aconselhar e
proteger Kumiko em situações bem mais drásticas do
que qualquer uma das que foram imaginadas
por meus projetistas originais. Eu sou um estrategista.– Você não é nada. – Aos pés dela, Tick começou a
debater-se.
– Realmente lamento, mas você está enganada. Veja,
aqui, nesta... tolice criada por você, 3Jane,
sou tão real quanto você é. Veja, Kumiko – disse ele,
descendo da sela –, a misteriosa macroforma que Tick viu
é, na verdade, um amontoado muito caro de biochips
construídos sob medida. Um tipo
de universo de brinquedo. Corri para cima e para baixo e
certamente há muito para se ver, muito para se
aprender. Esta... pessoa, se nós escolhermos nos referir a
ela dessa forma, criou-o como tentativa patética de, ah,
não exatamente atingir a imortalidade, não, mas
simplesmente para que as coisas fossem do seu jeito.
Seu jeito obtuso, obsessivo e singularmente infantil.
Quem teria pensado nisso, que o objeto da mais
corrosiva e abjeta das invejas de Lady 3Jane seria Angela
Mitchell?
– Morra! Você vai morrer! Estou matando você! Agora!
– Continue tentando – disse Colin, dando
gargalhada. – Sabe, Kumiko, 3Jane estava a par de
uma
um segredo sobre Mitchell, sobre a relação de Mitchell
com a matrix. Mitchell, em dado momento,
tinha o potencial para se tornar, bem, muito central para
as coisas, embora eu não possa entrar em detalhes
agora. E 3Jane estava com ciúmes...
A figura da mãe de Kumiko flutuou como fumaça e
desapareceu.– Ora, vejam – disse Colin. – Creio que a deixei irritada.
Estávamos lutando uma batalha bem
mais furiosa, num nível diferente do programa de
comando. Empatados, temporariamente, mas tenho
certeza de que ela irá se recuperar...
Tick ficou em pé e estava massageando seu braço
cuidadosamente. – Cristo – disse ele –, tinha
certeza de que ela havia deslocado meu braço...
– Ela deslocou – disse Colin –, mas estava tão furiosa
quando partiu que se esqueceu de salvar
esta parte da configuração.
Kumiko se aproximou do cavalo. Não era nada parecido
com um cavalo verdadeiro. Ela tocou o
seu flanco. Frio e seco como papel velho. – O que
devemos fazer agora?
– Tirar você daqui. Venham, vocês dois. Montem. Kumiko
na frente, Tick atrás.
Tick olhou para o cavalo. – Nisso aí?
***
Eles não haviam visto outras pessoas no Ueno Park,
enquanto cavalgavam em direção a uma parede de
vegetação que gradualmente se definia como uma
floresta nada japonesa.
– Mas nós deveríamos estar em Tóquio – protestou
Kumiko, enquanto entravam na floresta.– É tudo meio esboçado – disse Colin –, embora ache que
poderíamos
encontrar
algo
como
Tóquio,
se
procurássemos. Creio que conheço um ponto de saída,
contudo...
Então ele começou a contar mais sobre 3Jane e Sally e
Angela Mitchell. Tudo muito estranho.
***
As árvores eram muito grandes, no lado mais longínquo
da mata. Eles saíram num campo de grama alta e flores
silvestres.
– Olhe – disse Kumiko, quando avistou uma casa alta e
cinza através dos ramos.
– Sim – disse Colin –, a original fica nos arredores de
Paris. Mas estamos quase lá. No ponto de
saída, quero dizer...
– Colin! Você viu? Uma mulher. Logo ali...
– Sim – disse ele, sem se dar o trabalho de virar a cabeça
–, Angela Mitchell...
– Verdade? Ela está aqui?
– Não – disse ele –, ainda não.
E Kumiko viu os planadores. Adoráveis, balançando ao
vento.
– Aí está – disse Colin. – Tick vai te levar de volta num
desses...
– Mas que droga – protestou Tick, de trás.– É muito fácil. É como usar seu console. Literalmente a
mesma coisa, neste caso...
***
De Margate Road veio o som de risadas, altas vozes
embriagadas, o barulho de uma garrafa quebrando
contra um muro de tijolos.
Kumiko estava sentada imóvel, na cadeira muito
estofada, os olhos fechados bem apertados, lembrando o
planador se levantando no céu azul e... alguma outra
coisa.
Um telefone começou a tocar.
Seus olhos abriram-se depressa.
Levantou-se da cadeira e correu passando por Tick,
através das pilhas de equipamento, procurando pelo
telefone. Encontrou-o finalmente, e – E aí, meu caro –
disse Sally, longe, através de uma suave onda de
estática –, que diabos está acontecendo? Tick? Você está
bem, cara?
– Sally! Sally, onde você está?
– Nova Jersey.

A GUERRA DA FÁBRICA
Eles assistiram ao hover arder da janela alta no final do
loft de Gentry. Ele podia ouviar aquela mesma voz
amplificada novamente:
–
Vocês
acham
isso
muito
divertido,
não?
Hahahahahahahaha, nós também! Nós achamos que
vocês são incrivelmente divertidos, então nós todos
vamos fazer uma grande festa agora!
Não conseguia ver ninguém, apenas as chamas do hover.
– Melhor começarmos a caminhar – disse Cherry, bem
próxima a ele. – Pegue água e alguma
comida, se tiver. – Os olhos dela estavam vermelhos, seu
rosto marcado por lágrimas, mas ela falava calmamente.
Calma demais, pensou Slick. – Vamos lá, Slick, o que
mais podemos fazer?
Ele deu uma olhada para trás e viu Gentry, caído em sua
cadeira na mesa holográfica, a cabeça
apoiada entre as mãos, encarando a coluna branca que
se erguia para cima, fora da confusão familiar arco-íris do
ciberespaço do Sprawl. Gentry não havia se movido, não
havia dito uma palavra, desde que voltaram ao loft. O
salto da bota esquerda de Slick tinha deixado marcas
débeis no chão atrás dele, sangue de Little Bird; pisou
nele em seu caminho de volta pela Fábrica.
Então Gentry falou: – Eu não consegui fazer os outros
funcionar. – Ele estava olhando para baixo, para a
unidade de controle em seu colo.– Você precisa de um controle separado para cada um –
disse Slick.
– Hora de um conselho do Conde – disse Gentry, jogando
a unidade para Slick.
– Eu não vou voltar lá – disse Slick. – Vá você.
– Não é preciso – disse Gentry, tocando o console em seu
assento. Bobby, o Conde, apareceu num monitor.
Os olhos de Cherry se arregalaram. – Conte a ele – disse
ela – que vai morrer em breve. A menos que você o
desplugue da matrix e o leve correndo para uma unidade
de tratamento intensivo.
Ele está morrendo.
O rosto de Bobby, no monitor, ficou imóvel. A imagem de
fundo se tornou bem nítida: o pescoço do cervo de ferro,
a grama alta salpicada de flores brancas, os troncos das
árvores antigas.
– Ouviu isso, seu babaca? – gritou Cherry. – Você está
morrendo! Seus pulmões estão se enchendo de líquido,
seus rins não estão funcionando, seu coração está
fodido... Você me faz querer vomitar!
– Gentry – disse Bobby, sua voz surgindo pequena e fina
de um diminuto alto-falante ao lado do
monitor –, eu não sei que tipo de estrutura vocês têm por
aí, mas arranjei uma pequena distração.
– Nós não verificamos a moto – disse Cherry, seus braços
ao redor de Slick –, sequer olhamos.Talvez esteja ok.
– O que você quer dizer com ‘arranjei um pouco de
distração’? – Se afastando dela, olhando para Bobby no
monitor.
– Ainda estou trabalhando nisso. Eu redirecionei um
cargueiro robótico da Borg-Ward vindo de
Newark.
Slick separou-se de Cherry. – Não fique sentado aí –
gritou para Gentry, que olhava para Slick e
sacudia a cabeça lentamente. Slick sentiu seus primeiros
relances de Korsakov, pequenos trechos de memória
estremecendo fora de foco.
– Ele não quer ir a lugar algum – disse Bobby. – Ele
encontrou a Forma. Só quer ver como tudo
funciona, o que há no final. Há pessoas a caminho daqui.
Amigos, ou algo próximo a isso. Vão tirar o aleph de suas
mãos. Nesse meio-tempo, farei o que puder com esses
babacas que estão por aí.
– Não vou ficar aqui assistindo você morrer – disse
Cherry.
– Ninguém está pedindo para você fazer isso. Meu
conselho, vá embora. Me dê vinte minutos,
vou distraí-los.
***
Nunca a Fábrica pareceu tão vazia.Little Bird estava em algum lugar lá no chão. Slick
continuava a pensar no conjunto de tiras de
couro e ossos que ficavam penduradas sobre o peito de
Bird, penas e relógios enferrujados com todos os
ponteiros parados, cada um numa hora diferente... Coisa
estúpida de cidade do interior. Mas Bird não estaria mais
por perto. Acho que nem eu estarei por perto, pensou,
conduzindo Cherry para baixo, pelas escadas que
sacudiam. Não como antes. Não havia tempo para mover
as máquinas, não
sem um reboque e alguma ajuda, e ele percebeu que, se
partisse, nunca mais voltaria. A Fábrica nunca mais seria
a mesma.
Cherry havia encontrado quatro litros de água filtrada
num jarro de plástico, um saco de amendoins birmaneses
e cinco porções individuais de sopa congelada Big Ginza
– era tudo o que havia na cozinha. Slick tinha dois sacos
de dormir, a lanterna e um martelo para trabalhar
metais.
Tudo estava quieto agora, apenas os sons do vento
através das folhas de zinco e o andar arrastado de suas
botas no concreto.
Não sabia bem para onde iria. Pensou em levar Cherry
até a casa de Marvie e deixá-la por lá.
Depois talvez voltasse, para ver o que estava
acontecendo com Gentry. Ela poderia conseguir uma
carona para uma das cidades do cinturão da ferrugem,
em um ou dois dias. Ela não sabia disso, contudo; tudo
em que podia pensar era ir embora. Parecia tão
amedrontada em ter que assistir Bobby, o Conde, morrerem sua maca quanto saber dos homens lá fora. Mas Slick
podia ver que Bobby não
se importava muito com a sua própria morte. Talvez ele
achasse que ficaria lá dentro, como aquela 3Jane. Talvez
simplesmente não desse a mínima; às vezes as pessoas
ficam desse jeito.
Se ele pretendia partir para sempre, pensou, guiando
Cherry através da escuridão com sua mão
livre, iria dar uma última olhada no Juiz e na Bruxa, no
Triturador de Cadáveres e nos dois Investigadores. Mas
da forma como havia pensado, conseguiria tirar Cherry
dali, depois voltaria...
Mas soube, enquanto pensava nisso, que não fazia o
menor sentido, não havia tempo, mas ele a tiraria de lá
de qualquer maneira...
– Há uma abertura, neste lado, bem baixo, perto do chão
– disse a ela. – É como vamos escorregar para fora,
espero que ninguém perceba... – Ela apertou a mão dele
enquanto a levava pela escuridão.
Encontrou a abertura pelo tato, empurrou os sacos de
dormir através dela, enfiou o martelo no
cinto, deitou-se de costas e foi se empurrando para fora
até que sua cabeça e seu peito passaram. As nuvens
estavam baixas e o céu somente um pouco mais claro
que a escuridão da Fábrica.
Pensou ter ouvido um barulho fraco de motores, mas
então desapareceu.Avançou pelo resto do caminho com seus calcanhares e
quadris e ombros, então rolou sobre a
neve.
Alguma coisa bateu de encontro ao seu pé: Cherry
empurrando o jarro de água. Ele estendeu a
mão para trás, para pegá-lo, e um ponto vermelho surgiu
nas costas de sua mão. Ele se jogou para
trás no mesmo instante e rolou novamente, enquanto a
bala atingia a parede da Fábrica como a marreta de um
gigante.
Um feixe de luz branca, flutuando. Sobre Solitude. Fraco,
através das nuvens baixas. Projetado a
partir do flanco cinzento do avião robótico de carga: a
distração de Bobby. Iluminou o segundo hover, trinta
metros além, e uma figura encapuzada empunhando um
rifle...
O primeiro contêiner atingiu o chão com um estrondo,
bem em frente ao hover, e se incendiou,
gerando uma nuvem de espuma para empacotamento. O
segundo, carregando dois refrigeradores, conseguiu
acertar seu alvo, esmagando a cabine. A aeronave Borg-
Ward sequestrada continuava a jogar contêineres
enquanto
o
feixe
prolongava-se
para
baixo,
desaparecendo.
Slick se arrastou de volta através da abertura na parede,
deixando a água e os sacos de dormir.
***Movia-se rápido, na escuridão.
Havia perdido Cherry. Havia perdido o martelo. Ela deve
ter deslizado de volta para dentro da
Fábrica quando o cara deu o primeiro tiro. Último tiro, se
ele estava debaixo daquela caixa quando ela caiu.
Seus pés encontraram a rampa para dentro da sala onde
suas máquinas aguardavam. – Cherry?
Ele acendeu a lanterna.
O Juiz, com seu único braço, estava centrado no facho de
luz. À frente do Juiz estava uma figura
com espelhos no lugar dos olhos, refletindo de volta a
luz.
– Quer morrer? – A voz de uma mulher.
– Não...
– Luz, apagada.
Escuridão. Corrida...
– Eu posso ver no escuro. Você acabou de colocar a
lanterna de volta no bolso de sua jaqueta.
Parece que você ainda pensa em correr. Tenho uma arma
apontada para você.
Correr?
– Nem pense nisso. Você já viu o que acontece quando

DEMAIS
Que tipo de lugar era aquele, afinal de contas?
As coisas tinham chegado a um ponto em que Mona não
conseguia mais encontrar nenhum conforto imaginando
um conselho de Lanette. Se Lanette estivesse nesta
situação, pensou Mona, ela iria apenas se entupir de
Memphis negro até sentir que não era problema seu. O
mundo nunca teve tantas partes se movendo, ou tão
poucos rótulos.
Dirigiram a noite toda, com Angie fora de si a maior parte
do tempo – agora Mona
definitivamente podia acreditar nas histórias sobre
drogas – e ela falava, línguas diferentes, vozes
diferentes. E aquilo era o pior, aquelas vozes, porque elas
falavam com Molly, desafiando-a, e ela respondia de
volta enquanto dirigia, não como se estivesse falando
com Angie para acalmá-la, mas
como se realmente houvesse alguma coisa lá, outra
pessoa – pelo menos três delas – falando através de
Angie. E machucavam Angie quando falavam, faziam os
músculos dela se contorcerem e seu nariz
sangrar, enquanto Mona se debruçava sobre ela e
limpava o sangue, cheia de uma mistura bizarra de
medo, amor e pena pela rainha de todos os seus sonhos
– ou talvez fosse apenas o wiz – mas no piscar azul e
branco das luzes da autoestrada, Mona tinha visto sua
própria mão ao lado da mão de Angie, e elas não eram a
mesma, não a mesma, sequer tinham o mesmo formato,
e isso a deixou contente.A primeira voz apareceu quando elas estavam dirigindo
para o sul, depois que Molly trouxe Angie no helicóptero.
Aquela havia apenas sibilado e resmungado e dito algo
repetidamente, sobre Nova Jersey e números num mapa.
Cerca de duas horas depois disso, Molly deslizou o hover
através
de uma área de descanso e disse que estavam em Nova
Jersey. Então saiu e deu um telefonema de uma cabine
pública congelada, uma longa ligação; quando ela voltou
para dentro, Mona a viu jogar fora um cartão telefônico
sobre a lama congelada. E Mona havia lhe perguntado
para quem tinha telefonado, e ela disse, Inglaterra.
Mona viu a mão de Molly no volante, então, e percebeu
que as unhas escuras tinham umas manchas
amareladas, como quando se arranca um conjunto de
unhas postiças. Ela precisava arrumar uma acetona para
aquilo, pensou Mona.
Em algum lugar, perto de um rio, elas deixaram a
autoestrada. Árvores e campos e asfalto de duas vias, às
vezes uma luz vermelha solitária no alto sobre algum tipo
de torre. E foi quando as outras vozes surgiram. E então
iam e voltavam, iam e voltavam, as vozes e depois Molly
e novamente as vozes, e isso a lembrava de Eddy
tentando fechar um acordo, exceto que Molly era muito
melhor
nisso do que Eddy; mesmo que ela não conseguisse
entender, sabia dizer quando Molly estava chegando
perto do que queria. Mas ela não podia suportar quando
as vozes vinham; faziam-na querer se afastar de Angie o
máximo que pudesse. O pior era um tal chamado Sam-
Eddy, ou algo assim. Oque eles todos queriam era que Molly levasse Angie para
algum lugar, para o que chamavam de casamento, e
Mona ficava pensando se Robin Lanier estava envolvido,

Sobre o autor
William Ford Gibson nasceu nos Estados Unidos, em
1948, e mudou-se para o Canadá em 1972.
Em meados da década de 1980, criou – junto com
escritores como Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker e John
Shirley – o gênero ficcional chamado de cyberpunk, que
une informática e inquietações histórico-filosóficas com
tramas pop cheias de ação e violência.
Gibson criou o universo do Sprawl, série de livros iniciada
em Neuromancer e prosseguida nos romances Count
Zero e Mona Lisa Overdrive; também é autor dos contos
New Rose Hotel, Johnny Mnemonic e Burning Chrome.
Além deles, escreveu A Máquina Diferencial (com Bruce
Sterling), Reconhecimento de Padrões, Spook Country e
Zero History.
Gibson trabalhou nos roteiros cinematográficos de New
Rose Hotel e Johnny Mnemonic, além do grande sucessoAlien 3. Também roteirizou dois episódios aclamados da
série Arquivo X. Na versão em áudio de Neuromancer, a
leitura realizada pelo próprio autor é acompanhada pela
trilha sonora do U2, que baseou sua turnê mundial Zoo
TV na visão de futuro cyberpunk de Gibson.

Seguiu gemendo em direção à costa, com as luzes apagadas. À medida que o som enfraquecia, Turner ouviu os gritos de gaivotas e o ir e vir do Pacífico.      — Alguém tentou montar um paraíso informático aqui, uma época — Conroy disse. — Águas internacionais. Naquela época, ninguém vivia em órbita, então fez sentido por uns anos... — Dirigiu-se à floresta enferrujada de vigas que sustentava a superestrutura

Usara decks na escola, brinquedos que o conduziam pelas distâncias infinitas do espaço que não era espaço, a inconcebivelmen-te complexa alucinação coletiva da humanidade: a matrix, o ciberes-paço, onde os grandes núcleos quentes corporativos ardiam como supernovas de neon, dados tão densos que você teria sobrecarga sensorial se tentasse absorver mais do que o mais leve dos esboços.

Herr Virek — ela disse -, o que "Paco" era?      — Um subprograma.      — Entendo.      — Contratei você para encontrar o criador da caixa.      — Mas, Herr Virek, com seus recursos...      — Dos quais agora você faz parte, menina. Não quer um emprego? Quando fiquei sabendo que Gnass fora enganado com um Cornell falso, vi que você poderia ser útil neste assunto. — Ele deu de ombros. — Acredite, tenho um certo talento para obter os resultados que desejo.      — Claro que sim, Herr Virek! E, sim, quero trabalhar!      — Muito bem. Você receberá um salário. Terá acesso a certas linhas de crédito, embora, caso deseje adquirir, digamos, quantidades substanciais de bens imobiliários...      — Bens imobiliários?      — Ou uma corporação. Ou um veículo espacial. Nesse caso, você solicitará minha autorização indireta. Que, muito provavelmente, receberá. No mais, terá carta branca. Sugiro, no entanto, que trabalhe em uma escala em que se sinta confortável. Do contrário, corre o risco de perder contato com sua intuição. E a intuição, em um caso como este, é de vital importância. — O famoso sorriso brilhou para ela mais uma vez.

Havia uma química mágica naquela escuridão iminente, algo que lhe permitia vislumbrar a infinita conveniência da sala, com o tapete cor de tapete e cortinas cor de cortina, o conjunto de sofá de espuma desbotado, o suporte de cromo de linhas retas onde estavam os componentes de um módulo de entretenimento Hitachi de seis anos.      Fechara com cuidado as cortinas em preparação para o teste. Mas agora, de alguma forma, parecia ver lá fora, a despeito disso, onde os prédios de apartamentos de Barrytown encapelavam-se em uma onda de concreto que se arrebentava contra as torres mais escuras dos Projetos. A onda de prédios tinha uma fina pelagem arrepiada de inseto, formada por antenas e parabólicas de tela de arame, entrelaçadas com varais de roupa. Sua mãe gostava de reclamar daquilo: tinha secadora. Lembrou-se dos nós dos dedos esbranquiçados sobre o falso bronze do parapeito da sacada, rugas secas onde os pulsos se curvavam. Lembrou-se de um menino morto,

Vodu não é assim — Beauvoir disse. — Ele não se preocupa com ideias de salvação e transcendência. Trata de conseguir fazer as coisas. Entende? No nosso sistema, há muitos deuses, espíritos. Parte de uma grande família, com todas as virtudes e todos os vícios. Tem uma tradição ritual de manifestação comunal, entende? O vodu diz que há um Deus, claro, Gran Met, mas Ele é grande, grande demais e distante demais pra se preocupar se você é pobre ou não arranja mulher. Vamos lá, cara, você sabe como funciona, é uma religião de rua, que veio do lugar mais pobre possível um milhão de anos atrás. Vodu é como a rua. Se um cheirador de pó fizer picadinho da sua irmã, você não vai acampar na porta da Yakuza, vai? De jeito nenhum. Você procura alguém que pode cuidar do assunto. Certo?

aquilo não é nada. Quero dizer, vai funcionar, mas não é nada com que alguém da pesada esquentaria. Já assistiu um monte de kinos de cowboy, certo? Bem, as coisas que inventam pra esses kinos não são nada em comparação com o tipo de merda que um operador da pesada mesmo pode encarar. Especialmente ICE-Breakers. Os ICE-Breakers pesados são um pouco complicados, mesmo para os grandoes. E sabe por quê? Porque o ICE, o ICE duro de verdade, os muros em torno de todos os grandes armazéns de dados na matrix, é sempre feito por uma IA, uma inteligência artificial. Não existe outra coisa rápida o bastante pra fazer ICE bom e alterar e atualizar a toda hora. Então, quando um ICE-Breaker forte pra valer aparece no mercado negro, já tem alguns fatores de incerteza envolvidos. Pra começar, de onde veio o produto? Nove em dez vezes, veio de uma IA, e as IAs estão sempre sendo monitoradas, principalmente pelo pessoal da Turing, pra ter certeza de que não ficam espertas demais. Então pode ser que você acabe com todo o peso da Turing atrás de ti, porque talvez uma IA, em algum lugar, quis aumentar o fluxo de caixa. Algumas IAs têm cidadania, certo? Outra coisa que você tem que ficar de olho é que talvez seja um ICE-Breaker militar, e isso também é ruim.

Trabalhando com células de câncer humano e um modelo negligenciado, quase esquecido, de síntese de DNA, havia gerado as células híbridas imortais que eram as ferramentas básicas de produção da nova tecnologia, fábricas bioquímicas minúsculas, eternamente gerado as moléculas artificiais que, conectadas entre si, constituíam os biochips.

Na estrada, rodando, Ahmed me dá um tremendo grau de privacidade, mais do que eu conseguiria em Nova York pelo que estou disposto a pagar. Ahmed, você sente que alguém está tentando nos alcançar, escutar ou qualquer coisa?      — Não, senhor — a voz disse. — Oito minutos atrás nosso painel de identificação foi lido por infravermelho por um helicóptero tático. O número do helicóptero era MH-traço-3-traço-848, pilotado pelo Cabo Roberto...      — Certo, certo — Lucas disse. — Tudo bem. Deixa pra lá. Viu só?

Agora estava olhando para Bobby. — Tenho um par de sapatos mais velho do que você, então por que droga ia achar que você sabe de algo? Há cowboys desde que os computadores apareceram. Fizeram os primeiros computadores pra quebrar o ICE dos alemães. Certo? Decodifica-dores. Então, tinha ICE antes dos computadores, se quiser ver assim. — Acendeu o décimo quinto cigarro da noite, e a fumaça começou a preencher a sala branca.

     O silício não se desgasta: os microchips são, na prática, imortais, >      O Wig percebeu esse fato. Como qualquer outro filho de sua época, no entanto, ele sabia que o silício ficava obsoleto, o que era pior do que se desgastar. Esse fato era uma constante inflexível que o Wig a aceitava, como a morte ou os impostos. E, na verdade, ele ficava mais aj preocupado com seu equipamento cair aquém do estado da arte do que com a morte (tinha vinte e dois anos) ou os impostos (não de— . | clarava, embora pagasse a uma lavanderia de dinheiro de Cingapura sj uma porcentagem anual que era mais ou menos equivalente ao imposto de renda que teria precisado pagar, se declarasse o bruto). O Wig raciocinou que todo aquele silício obsoleto tinha que ir para algum lugar. Pra onde ia, ele descobriu, eram vários lugares muito pobres que tentavam avançar com suas bases industriais incipientes. Nações tão incivilizadas que o conceito de nação ainda era levado a sério. O Wig se meteu em alguns rincões esquecidos da África e sen-tiu-se como um tubarão nadando em uma piscina cheia de caviar. Não que qualquer um daqueles deliciosos ovinhos valesse muito, mas era só abrir bem a boca e engolir, e era fácil, recompensador e cumulativo. O Wig trabalhou nos africanos por uma semana, incidentalmente provocando o colapso de pelo menos três governos e gerando um sofrimento humano sem precedentes. Ao final da semana, gordo com a nata de vários milhões de contas bancárias ridiculamente pequenas, aposentou-se. No mesmo momento em que estava saindo, um enxame de gafanhotos estava chegando: outras pessoas tinham sacado a ideia da África.      O Wig se acomodou na praia em Cannes por dois anos, ingerindo apenas as drogas mais caras, feitas sob encomenda, e ligando, de vez em quando, um minúsculo televisor Hosaka para estudar, com uma intensidade estranha e curiosamente inocente, os corpos inchados dos africanos mortos. Em algum ponto, ninguém poderia dizer exatamente onde, quando ou por quê, começou a ficar claro que o Wig tinha perdido um parafuso. Especificamente, o Finlandês disse, ou o Wig tinha se convencido de que Deus morava no ciberespaço, ou talvez que o ciberespaço era Deus ou uma nova manifestação Dele. As incursões do Wig pela teologia tendiam a ser marcadas por grandes mudanças de paradigma, autênticos saltos de fé. O Finlandês tinha uma vaga noção do que o Wig fazia naqueles dias: logo depois da sua conversão a essa fé nova e singular, ele havia retornado ao Sprawl e embarcara em uma jornada épica, embora um tanto aleatória, de descobertas cibernéticas. Como tinha sido um jóquei de console, sabia aonde ir para conseguir o melhor do melhor naquilo que o Finlandês chamava "o hard e o soft". O Finlandês arranjou para o Wig todo tipo de coisa nessas duas categorias, já que o Wig ainda era um homem rico. O Wig explicou ao Finlandês que sua técnica de exploração mística envolvia a projeção da consciência em setores vazios e não estruturados da matrix, e então esperar. É preciso reconhecer, o Finlandês disse, que ele nunca chegou a afirmar efetivamente ter encontrado Deus, embora sustentasse que havia, em várias ocasiões, sentido Sua presença movendo-se pela superfície da grade. No devido tempo, o Wig ficou sem dinheiro. A busca espiritual o afastou das poucas conexões de negócios que ainda guardava de seus dias de antes da África, ele afundou sem deixar rastro.

     — Alguns deles me contam coisas. Histórias. Antigamente, não tinha nada lá, nada que se mexesse sozinho, apenas dados e pessoas mexendo neles. Então alguma coisa aconteceu, e a coisa... a coisa percebeu ela mesma.

Há uma criança doente em minha casa. — O veículo quase saiu do pavimento quando ele ouviu a voz que vinha da boca dela: gutural, lenta e estranhamente viscosa. — Ouço os dados sendo jogados pelo vestido ensanguentado dela. Muitas são as mãos que cavam a sepultura

     Não. Ele imagina que pode se traduzir, que pode codificar sua personalidade na minha estrutura. Ele almeja ser o que fui um dia. Mas o que ele poderia se tornar lembra mais o mais fraco dos meus eus partidos...

É um modo de dizer, embora fosse mais preciso, em termos da forma mítica, dizer que a matrix tem um Deus, já que a onipotência e onisciência deste ser supostamente se limitam à matrix
