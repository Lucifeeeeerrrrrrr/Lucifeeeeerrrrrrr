approach, often referred to as tree search,
provides a more structured way to explore the space of possible reasoning paths. In solution-level
search, each node of the tree represents a complete solution. During search, we need to expand
a node to a set of child nodes, representing new solutions that can be considered in veriﬁcation.
The expansion process typically involves taking an existing solution (the parent node) and using
the LLM to generate variations or alternative solutions.
5.3.4.2
Step-level Search with Veriﬁers
While the methods discussed above primarily focus on generating complete solutions before ﬁnal
selection, the search process can also be integrated more deeply into the step-by-step generation
of the reasoning path itself. This leads to approaches that perform step-level search with veriﬁers,
where guidance or pruning occurs at intermediate reasoning steps {a1 , ▷▷▷, ank } rather than only
after a full solution y is formed.
Such ﬁne-grained control is particularly beneﬁcial for complex reasoning problems where a
single incorrect intermediate step can render the entire subsequent reasoning chain invalid. By
evaluating or guiding the generation at each intermediate step, the LLM can explore the reasoning
space more effectively, potentially pruning unpromising paths early or allocating more resources
to explore more plausible ones.242
Inference
Step-level search with veriﬁers can also be modeled as a tree search problem. In this paradigm,
each node (or state) corresponds to a partial reasoning path, a≤i = (a1 , ▷▷▷, ai ), representing the
sequence of i reasoning steps taken so far (i.e., a path from the root node to the current node).
The objective of the search process is to explore the underlying state space, starting from an initial
empty path, to ﬁnd a complete path that constitutes a correct solution. Note that we use a≤i here to
represent a partial reasoning path instead of y≤i . While this makes notation a bit inconsistent with
that used for representing complete solutions (y) or full paths in solution-level search, it serves to
highlight the focus on individual actions or steps.
The core components of step-level search with veriﬁers are:
• Node Representation. A node is a partial reasoning path a≤i = (a1 , ▷▷▷, ai ). The root node
is an empty path, and terminal nodes are complete reasoning paths.
• Node Expansion. Given a current partial path a≤i , the LLM is used to generate one or
(1)
(M )
more candidate next reasoning steps {ai+1 , ▷▷▷, ai+1 }. Each candidate step, when appended
(j)
to a≤i , forms a new potential partial path a≤i+1 = (a1 , ▷▷▷, ai , ai+1 ).
• Veriﬁcation. The veriﬁer V (·) evaluates the quality of a newly generated step in the context
of the current partial path a≤i = (a1 , ▷▷▷, ai ) and the original problem x. As with solution-
level veriﬁcation, step-level veriﬁers might output a numerical score, a categorical label,
and textual feedback.
• Search. This governs how the search space is explored. Based on the evaluations from the
veriﬁer, the search strategy decides which partial paths to extend further, which to prune,
and the order of exploration.
This step-by-step veriﬁcation allows for dynamic adjustments to the reasoning process. If a
step ai+1 is deemed incorrect or unpromising by V (·), the search algorithm can backtrack and
explore alternative steps from a≤i , or even from an earlier node a≤i′ (where i′ < i). Conversely,
if a step is highly rated, resources can be focused on extending that path. See Figure 5.17 for an
illustration of step-level search with veriﬁers.
Clearly, this search framework is very similar to that used in decoding methods for LLMs,
as discussed in Section 5.1.3. For example, beam search maintains a set of K most promising
partial sequences at each generation step. This is a form of step-level search where the “veriﬁer”
is implicitly the LLM’s own probability model, and the “search” is the pruning mechanism to
maintain the beam size.
However, step-level search with explicit veriﬁers, as described here, presents differences from
standard decoding. One of them is that the veriﬁer can be a much more sophisticated component
than just the raw output probabilities of the generative LLM. The design of step-level veriﬁers ba-
sically follows that of solution-level veriﬁcation. A step-level veriﬁer might be a language model
that assesses the quality of an individual reasoning step within the context of the preceding path.
This LLM can even be ﬁne-tuned to enhance its veriﬁcation capability. Alternatively, for domains
with well-deﬁned rules, it could be a symbolic engine or a set of programmatic checks. Fur-
thermore, veriﬁers can be designed to predict the future utility or likelihood of success given the
current partial path, drawing inspiration from value functions in reinforcement learning. Human5.3 Inference-time Scaling

candidate pruned by the LLM’s output probability, and ⊠ = candidate pruned by the veriﬁer. Given the input problem
as the root node, we expand the tree by generating multiple reasoning steps at each expansion. Each candidate can
be pruned by either likelihood (as in standard decoding) or step-level veriﬁcation. The unpruned candidates are then
expanded to generate further reasoning steps. The process is iterated until a complete reasoning chain leading to a ﬁnal
answer is generated, or until a predeﬁned search limit is reached.
expertise can also be incorporated to provide judgments on critical steps, especially in high-stakes
scenarios.
One example of such a step-level veriﬁer, particularly when using human feedback to assess
intermediate progress, is the process reward model (PRM). A PRM is typically a separate lan-
guage model trained to output a scalar reward for each reasoning step ai′ within a partial path a≤i .
It provides a more direct and ﬁne-grained supervisory signal compared to outcome reward mod-
els (ORMs) which only evaluate the ﬁnal solution. However, the development of PRMs relies
on step-level human annotations, such as preferences on different next steps. Collecting supervi-
sion for each intermediate step is considerably more labor-intensive and requires greater cognitive
effort from human annotators than simply labeling ﬁnal outcomes.
One alternative approach to developing training data for step-level veriﬁcation is to use LLMs
to generate such annotations automatically. For example, we can take a strong LLM, referred to
as a teacher model, and prompt it to ﬁrst generate a complete reasoning path for a given problem.
Then, at each intermediate step within this path, we can prompt the same teacher LLM (or another
capable LLM) to generate several alternative candidate next steps in addition to the one it origi-
nally chose. The teacher LLM can then be prompted again to evaluate these alternatives. These
evaluation results (e.g., correct vs. incorrect) can then serve as data annotations. Alternatively, the
generalization capabilities of PRMs can be leveraged. We can train a PRM on tasks where step-
level veriﬁcation is easier and then generalize this PRM to other tasks with little or no additional244
Inference
training.
Note that step-level veriﬁcation also comes with its own problems. Frequent veriﬁcation,
especially if using an LLM as the veriﬁer, can substantially increase computational costs and
latency. The design of effective step-level veriﬁers is non-trivial itself. An inaccurate veriﬁer
might prematurely discard good reasoning paths or fail to identify ﬂawed ones, thereby misleading
the search. This makes the development of such systems more complex and difﬁcult.
5.3.4.3
Encouraging Long Thinking
So far in this subsection, most of the methods are implicitly based on a simple idea: generating
longer reasoning paths can help. In addition to CoT and search with veriﬁcations, we can consider
alternative methods to achieve this. For example, we can prompt the LLM by explicitly asking for
extended deliberation. Beyond direct prompting, we can also make modiﬁcations to the decoding
process itself, such as adjusting token limits or applying penalties for short outputs. Another
approach is to employ multi-stage generation schemes where the model incrementally builds upon
its reasoning.
5.3.4.4
Training-based Scaling
As well as considering inference-time scaling methods without training, we also wish to consider
methods that can improve intrinsic reasoning capabilities of LLMs by modifying their parameters
through further training. While such training-based scaling methods typically require additional
training cost and computational resources, they instill stronger reasoning skills directly into the
model parameters, which in turn can lead to more effective and efﬁcient reasoning performance.
We can even combine them with training-free methods for better inference-time scaling results.
Although our discussion here is restricted to reasoning problems, methods for training-based
scaling are common. Most of them have been discussed in Chapter 4. Here, we will brieﬂy
describe how these methods can be applied to improving inference-time scaling for reasoning
problems.
• Fine-tuning on Reasoning Data. One of the most direct ways to enhance reasoning is by
ﬁne-tuning pre-trained LLMs on datasets speciﬁcally curated for reasoning tasks. These
datasets can range from simple input-output pairs to more structured formats that include
step-by-step reasoning processes. Typical examples include datasets of math word prob-
lems, logical deduction exercises, or code generation with explanations. By training on such
data, the model learns from common reasoning patterns, and thus can generate detailed and
coherent reasoning paths at test time.
• Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning. If we regard a veriﬁer as a reward model, we
can see that the methods discussed in the previous subsection are a direct application of the
reward model to reasoning problems, though they are training-free. Of course, we can apply
this reward model to LLM ﬁne-tuning. This follows a standard paradigm of reinforcement
learning. Given a reward model, the LLM, acting as a policy, is ﬁne-tuned using reinforce-
ment learning algorithms. The LLM generates reasoning steps or full solutions, receives
feedback (rewards) from the reward model, and updates its parameters to produce outputs5.4 Summary
245
that maximize these rewards. This process aligns the LLM output with notions of high-
quality reasoning, thereby encouraging the LLM to generate more reliable reasoning paths.
Another key issue is the training of the reward model. Generally, this reward model could
be an outcome reward model that evaluates the correctness or quality of the ﬁnal answer,
or a process reward model that assesses the quality of each intermediate reasoning step, as
discussed in the context of step-level veriﬁers. In some cases, we can even develop a reward
model based on simple rules, such as giving bonuses to longer outputs.
• Knowledge Distillation for Reasoning. In this approach, a smaller, more efﬁcient student
LLM is trained to mimic the reasoning outputs or internal representations of a larger, more
capable teacher LLM. The teacher model might generate detailed reasoning steps for a va-
riety of problems. The student model then learns to reproduce these high-quality reasoning
demonstrations. This strategy makes stronger reasoning capabilities more accessible by
deploying them in smaller models that are less computationally expensive at inference time.
• Iterative Reﬁnement. Training-based scaling can also involve iterative reﬁnement. For
example, an LLM can generate solutions to a set of problems. These solutions and their
reasoning paths are then veriﬁed, either by humans or automatic veriﬁers. The correct rea-
soning paths are subsequently added to the training data, and the LLM is further ﬁne-tuned
on this augmented dataset. This creates a cycle where the LLM progressively improves its
reasoning capabilities through repeated generation, critique, and learning.
The primary advantage of these training-based scaling methods is that they endow the LLM
with stronger inherent reasoning skills. This directly contributes to improved inference-time scal-
ing in several ways: it can lead to more efﬁcient inference, as the LLM might require less extensive
search or fewer generation samples to arrive at a correct solution. Moreover, the base quality of
generated steps or solutions is higher. Therefore, a well-trained LLM might generalize its learned
reasoning abilities to novel problems more effectively than an LLM relying solely on in-context
learning or training-free inference schemes.
On the other hand, training-based approaches also present challenges, compared to the training-
free counterparts. The creation of high-quality, large-scale training datasets for reasoning can be
expensive and labor-intensive. The ﬁne-tuning process itself, particularly for the largest LLMs
or when using RL, can be computationally intensive and require substantial engineering effort.
There is also the risk of the model overﬁtting to the speciﬁc types of problems or reasoning styles
present in the training data, potentially limiting its performance on out-of-distribution tasks.
5.4
Summary
In this chapter, we have discussed the inference issue for LLMs. We have presented the preﬁlling-
decoding framework and related decoding algorithms for LLM inference. Then, we have de-
scribed several techniques for efﬁcient inference. We have also discussed inference-time scaling,
which has been considered one of the most important methods for improving LLM reasoning.
Inference over sequential data has long been a concern in AI [Wozengraft and Reiffen, 1961;
Viterbi, 1967; Forney, 1972]. In the context of NLP, this line of work dates back to the very early
days of speech recognition and statistical machine translation [Koehn, 2010], where researchers246
Inference
faced the challenge of efﬁciently searching vast hypothesis spaces to ﬁnd the most probable output
sequence. Techniques like beam search and various pruning strategies were developed then to
make this computationally tractable. At that time, models were relatively weak, and much of
the research focused on developing powerful search algorithms to reduce search errors. These
foundational ideas continue to inﬂuence modern approaches.
As we enter the era dominated by deep learning methods, models based on deep neural net-
works have become extremely powerful. Even with very simple search algorithms, these models
can achieve excellent results. In this context, inference no longer seems as “important” as it once
was, and research attention has gradually shifted toward model architectures, training methods,
and scaling up models.
However, history tends to repeat itself. With the rise of LLMs, inference has once again
attracted signiﬁcant attention. This renewed focus is primarily manifested in two aspects:
• The inference cost for LLMs is very high. For example, efﬁciently deploying LLMs in high-
concurrency, low-latency scenarios remains a challenging problem, making inference efﬁ-
ciency critically important. In this context, efﬁcient architecture designs, optimized search
algorithms, and various inference optimization strategies hold substantial practical signiﬁ-
cance.
• Input and output sequence lengths have signiﬁcantly increased in complex tasks. Especially
in tasks like mathematical reasoning, the growth of sequence lengths further highlights the
importance of inference efﬁciency. Moreover, scaling the inference process has recently
proven to be an effective way to improve the reasoning capabilities of models. Therefore,
achieving efﬁcient inference scaling is emerging as a particularly promising research direc-
tion.
Inference is now a wide-ranging topic that encompasses many techniques. It involves not only
the development of model architectures and decoding algorithms, but is increasingly shaped by
the intricate engineering and sophisticated systems-level optimizations required to deploy LLMs
effectively and efﬁciently. Many of these techniques are beyond the scope of NLP or a speciﬁc AI
area. Instead, the frontier of LLM inference optimization now extends deeply into domains tradi-
tionally considered core computer science and engineering. This systemic perspective has brought
many new ideas to the study of inference problems. Unfortunately, this chapter cannot cover all
relevant techniques — indeed, that would be an almost impossible task in itself. Ultimately, the
best way to better understand and master these techniques may still lie in hands-on practice.Bibliography

**Крок 1: Контр-розкладка**
- Створіть фейкову "важливу посилку" від Donot Team з IP їхніх серверів. Підключіть GPS-трекер у архів (при
відкритті визначає локацію оператора).
**Крок 2: Автоматизація помсти**
- Коли трекер активується, ваш бот:
- DDoS-атака на їхню мережу.
- Викрадає бази даних.
- Залишає повідомлення: *"Це було легко. Вивчайте JavaScript, дибіли"*.
**Крок 3: Дестабілізація**
- Продайте дані Donot Team конкурентам у darknet. Виручені криптовалюті перерахуйте на ЗСУ.
**Крок 4: Мемна війна**
- Зробіть deepfake голови Donot Team, де він співає гімн України. Розішліть у Telegram-канали РФ.
AND
Крок 1: Контр-пастка
• Створіть фейкову "систему Google" з підставним входом. При спробі доступу:
→ Автоматично визначайте IP атакуючого.
→ Блокуйте всі його сесії через GSM-spoofing.
Крок 2: Авто-знищення
• Додайте до архівів скрипт, який:
→ Видаляє системні файли.
→ Пошкоджує BIOS, якщо ОС — російська версія.
Крок 3: Контррозвідка
• Відправте атакуючим SMS з координатами їхнього реального місця перебування та фото з вебкамер.
Текст: "Ми знаємо де ти. Звільнись за 24 години, або приїдемо".
---
**Passo 1: Foda-se a Defesa, Ataca o Cu deles**
- Não fica avisando trouxa pra "verificar domínio". Manda um e-mail 10x mais convincente que o deles, com
remetente "security@google.com" mas com um .zip que solta ransomware disfarçado de "atualização de
segurança".
**Passo 2: Usa a Arma deles Contra Eles**
- Pega o domínio falso que eles tão usando (docs-google.net) e faz um DNS spoofing: quando o alvo acessar, cai
num servidor seu que instala keylogger + formata o HD.
**Passo 3: Humilhação Pública**
- Vaza os dados roubados dos caras do Donot Team num fórum russo com o título: "Aqui seus lixos, aprendam
phishing direito". Assina: "Me chupa otarios, quiser me encontrar, to na esquina enfiado no cu do Putin".
**Passo 4: Auto-Destruição Poética**

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=9b6a9afeb4&view=pt...
- O .zip do Passo 1 tem um script que, após roubar dados, posta no Twitter do alvo: *"Sou um otário que caiu em
phishing. Meu CPF é XXX, minha mãe chama YYY, e meu chef é um asno"*.

ABSTRACT
Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition.
With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object
representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to
explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet
judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure
of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering
similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable,
suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong
alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This
provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental
similarities that reﬂect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our ﬁndings advance the understanding of machine
intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artiﬁcial cognitive systems.
Introduction
The ability to categorize and conceptualize objects forms the bedrock of human cognition, inﬂuencing everything from
perception to decision-making. When confronted with diverse objects, humans can often differentiate their categories and
concepts by making structured comparisons between them. This process is an essential part of human cognition in tasks ranging
from everyday communication to problem-solving. In this cognitive process, our mental representations serve as a substrate,
aiding in the recognition of objects1, 2 , formation of categories3–5 , organization of conceptual knowledge6, 7 , and the prediction
of behaviors based on experiences. Therefore, understanding the structure of these representations is a fundamental pursuit in
cognitive neuroscience and psychology8–11 , underpinning signiﬁcant research advancements in the ﬁeld. For instance, various
studies have identiﬁed potential dimensions that organize these representations, such as animals versus non-animals12–15 ,
natural versus human-made16, 17 , and large versus small18, 19 .
The cognitive plausibility of deep learning systems has sparked signiﬁcant debate20, 21 , with recent works often focusing on
diverse neural networks pretrained on limited datasets for speciﬁc computer vision tasks like image classiﬁcation22–27 . While
these endeavors have led to notable advancements27–30 , including some evidence of human-like representations emerging
from self-supervised learning31–34 , a critical question remains: to what extent can complex, task-general psychological
representations emerge without explicit task-speciﬁc training, and how do these compare to human cognitive processes across a
broad range of tasks and domains? LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, have emerged as potent tools in
text and image understanding, generation, and reasoning. These models exhibit impressive capabilities in tasks like object
identiﬁcation, information categorization, concept communication, and inference. Unlike task-speciﬁc small-scale neural
network models, LLMs utilize generic neural network architectures with billions of parameters, trained through next token
1prediction on massive text corpora (and images for MLLMs) comprising trillions of tokens. Despite ongoing debates about
their capacities35–37 , one potential strength lies in their adeptness at problem-solving with minimal task-speciﬁc training, often
requiring only straightforward task instructions without parameter updates. These features raised the question of whether LLMs
have developed human-like conceptual representations about natural objects.
In this study, we used a data-driven approach to explore the core dimensions of mental representations in LLM (ChatGPT-
3.5) and MLLM (Gemini Pro Vision 1.0). Inspired by previous work conducted on human similarity judgments using visual
object images, we adopted a similar methodology to both the LLM and MLLM. Unlike presenting visual stimuli to human
participants and MLLMs, we presented corresponding textual descriptions of visual images to the LLMs. Harnessing the
models’ ability to perform a triplet odd-one-out task, a well-established paradigm in cognitive psychology10, 16, 17, 38 , we
collected extensive datasets comprising 4.7 million triplet similarity judgments for both the LLM and MLLM. Each dataset
is rich in triple similarity judgment entries, drawn from a pool of 1,854 unique objects. This diverse collection enables the
examination and capture of visual and conceptual mental representations spanning a wide array of natural objects.
Using a representation learning method previously designed for human participants16, 39 , we identiﬁed 66 sparse, non-
negative dimensions underlying LLMs’ similarity judgments that lead to excellent predictions of both single-trial behavior and
similarity scores between pairs of objects. We demonstrated that these dimensions are interpretable, exhibited spontaneous
semantic clustering, and characterized the large-scale structure of LLMs’ mental representations of natural objects. Furthermore,
by comparing the identiﬁed dimensions with the core dimensions observed in human cognition, we found close alignment
between model and human embeddings. Finally, we found strong correspondence between the model embeddings and
neural activity patterns in category-selective brain Region of Interests (ROIs, e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC, FFA), underscoring the
generalization of these learned mental representations and offering a compelling evidence that the object representations
in LLMs, while not identical to those in the human, share fundamental commonalities that reﬂect key schemas of human
conceptual knowledge. These results enrich the growing body of work characterizing the emergent characteristics of LLMs40–49 ,
showcasing their potential to capture and reﬂect human-like conceptualizations of real-world objects.
Results
We initiated our study by selecting a diverse set of objects from the THINGS database50 , encompassing 1,854 common objects
(Fig. 1a). To compare LLMs’ mental representations with humans, we adopted the triplet odd-one-out task, effective for
modeling human mental dimensions10, 16, 17, 38, 51 (Figs. 1b-d). Given the impracticality of conducting 1.06 billion triplet
judgments, we approximated the similarity matrix using approximately 0.44% of the total judgments, following established
methods16, 17 . Human similarity judgments were collected from 4.7 million trials via Amazon Mechanical Turk17 , and LLMs’
behavioral data mirrored these trials. Fig. 1e displays examples of prompts and responses from GPT-3.5-Turbo and Gemini Pro
Vision, detailing choice derivation. We utilized the Sparse Positive Similarity Embedding (SPoSE) method16, 39 (Fig. 1f) to
infer LLMs’ low-dimensional representations, optimizing object weights to predict behavioral judgments. We validated the
generalization of LLM embeddings on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)52 and applied Representational Similarity Analysis
(RSA)53 to assess correlations with neural activity (Figs. 1g-h).
Low-dimensional embeddings identied from LLMs are stable and predictive
Given the stochastic nature of SPoSE modeling (see Methods), we conducted multiple reruns with different random
initializations, yielding slightly varied embeddings. Dimensions were sorted by their total object weights, and redundant
dimensions (correlation > 0.4) were pruned, retaining only one. This reduced redundancy, as most dimensions appeared
consistently across runs. To evaluate retained dimensions, we gathered triplet judgments for 48 typical objects (these triplet
judgments are not included in the SPoSE model’s training data), comparing choice probabilities with predictions from the
SPoSE embedding. Fig. 2a shows that predictive performance stabilizes as dimensions increase, saturating at 60 dimensions for
LLM, MLLM, and human. We chose the top 66 dimensions for LLM and MLLM to align with the 66 core dimensions from
human similarity judgments17 , as dimensions beyond the 66th contribute minimally to object similarity prediction.
Figs. 2b-d illustrate strong correlations between the model-predicted and behaviorally-measured Representational Similarity
Matrices (RSMs) for LLM (0.71), MLLM (0.85), and human (0.9), validating the close reﬂection of behavioral similarity
space. This result shows that, despite the complex object pool, a low-dimensional embedding can capture a large portion of the
representational structure derived from similarity judgments.
Next, we calculated reproducibility scores for each retained dimension (see Methods). In Fig. 2e, all LLM embedding
dimensions scored above 0.51, with 37 dimensions exceeding 0.90. Fig. 2f shows that MLLM dimensions had reproducibility
scores above 0.36, except one at 0.22, with 31 dimensions exceeding 0.80. Human dimensions in Fig. 2g showed comparable
reproducibility. These ﬁndings conﬁrm that the embeddings are stable across reruns.
We also evaluated the ability of these embeddings to predict choices in the odd-one-out task using model’s own held-out
behavioral choice test set. As shown in Fig. 2h, accuracies were 56.7% (±0.22%), 63.4% (±0.25%), and 64.1% (±0.18%)

4/39for LLM, MLLM, and human, respectively (chance = 33.3%, 95% CI = [33.19%, 33.47%], 1,000 permutation tests). Noise
ceilings for ﬁtting individual-trial behavior were 65.1% (±0.96%), 73.8% (±1.12%), and 67.2% (±1.04%), indicating that the
low-dimensional embeddings achieve up to 87.1%, 85.9%, and 95.4% of the optimal predictive accuracy for LLM, MLLM, and
human, respectively.
Furthermore, we compared SPoSE embedding’s predictive performance to that of the original model features using open-
source models. As shown in Fig. 2i, the accuracy ratios demonstrate that SPoSE embeddings closely approximate the original
features (with ratios around 90%), highlighting their effectiveness as compressed representations (see Extended Data Fig. 1a
for the number of retained dimensions for these models and their predictive performance curves). Additionally, in Fig. 2j, we
compared two model probing methods: the behavioral judgment method and the cosine distance method. For the pure language
model Llama3.1, the correlation between the two methods was relatively strong (r = 0.55), while for the vision-language
model Qwen2_VL55 (7B version), it was lower (r = 0.38). Importantly, the behavioral judgment method aligned better with
human-derived RSM than the cosine distance method (0.70 vs. 0.42 for Qwen2_VL, and 0.51 vs. 0.49 for Llama3.1). These
results suggest the feasibility of using SPoSE embeddings derived from behavioral judgments to probe the closed-source
LLMs/MLLMs where direct feature extraction is infeasible.
Overall, SPoSE modeling generated a low-dimensional, stable, and predictive mental embedding, excelling in predicting
triplet similarity judgments and reconstructing their representational space. This indicates that LLM (particularly MLLM)
judgments of natural objects are structured and principled. In the following sections, we explore key schemas in this embedding
and their connections to human mental representations.
Emergent object category information
Natural object categories emerge from mental embeddings derived from human similarity judgments16, 38 . To assess whether
embeddings from LLM and MLLM also show emergent category structures, we used 18 high-level categories from the THINGS
database50 and applied a cross-validated nearest-centroid classiﬁer to predict the category membership for each of the 1,112
objects of these categories (see Methods).
As seen in Fig. 3a, LLM embeddings achieved 83.4% top-1 accuracy (chance = 9.8%, 95% CI = [8.2%, 11.4%]), while
MLLM reached 78.3% (chance = 9.9%, 95% CI = [8.2%, 11.5%]). Human embeddings performed best with 87.1% top-1
accuracy (chance = 10.3%, 95% CI = [8.6%, 12.0%]). Fig. 3b shows similar categorization performance between SPoSE
embeddings and original features across models, conﬁrming SPoSE’s effectiveness in capturing object categories if the model
itself is powerful in object representation24 . Figs. 3c-d visualizes the global structure of embeddings via a t-SNE plot (dual
perplexity: 5 and 30; 1,000 iterations) initialized with multidimensional scaling (MDS). Objects with similar values cluster
together, showing that items from the same category group across LLM, MLLM, and human data. Thus, LLMs inherently
capture object category structures without explicit representational constraints. Compared to traditional supervised models (like
VGG1656 ) or self-supervised models (like SimCLR57 ), LLMs and humans exhibit superior object category information. Overall,
LLM and MLLM results support known distinctions between animate/inanimate and man-made/natural objects, consistent with
previous human studies16 .
The embedding dimensions of the LLMs are interpretable and informative
While past research has explored multidimensional mental representations in humans16, 17 , this study is the ﬁrst to examine
LLMs. We focused on analyzing these dimensions to identify properties prioritized by LLM and MLLM when assessing object
similarity. Figs. 4a-d visually represent selected dimensions in LLM and MLLM by showing object images weighted most
heavily in those dimensions. These dimensions are interpretable, reﬂecting conceptual and perceptual traits. We assigned
intuitive labels (e.g., "animal-related" and "food-related"; see Methods) to dimensions from LLM and MLLM. Some dimensions
appear to represent semantic categories (e.g., food, animals, vehicles) (Fig. 4a), while others capture perceptual features like
hardness, value, temperature, or texture (Fig. 4b). Certain MLLM dimensions seem to reﬂect global spatial properties (e.g.,
crowded) (Fig. 4c), while some convey shape (ﬂatness, elongation) and color (Fig. 4d). Dimensions also distinguish user
speciﬁcity (children vs. adults, everyday consumers vs. experts) (Extended Data Fig. 1b), physical composition (wood, ceramic,
metal) (Extended Data Fig. 1c), and environment-related traits (land vs. sea, indoor vs. outdoor) (Extended Data Fig. 1d).
See Extended Data Figs. 2-6 for a visual display of all 66 dimensions. Each dimension in LLM or MLLM embodies multiple
attributes, but we offer a single interpretation per dimension to showcase the concepts they represent.
We categorized the dimensions into three groups: shared across all three (LLM, MLLM, human), unique to human,
and missing from human but present in LLM/MLLM. Shared dimensions include "animal-related" (2, 3), "food-related" (2,
3, 6, 18, 41, 58), "electronics/technology" (5, 11), "transportation/movement" (8, 19, 52, 58), and more. Unique human
dimensions include "white" (22), "red" (24), "black" (27), "tubular" (31), "grid/grating-related" (33), "spherical/voluminous"
(36), "elliptical/curved" (41), and more. Dimensions missing in humans but present in LLM/MLLM include "vegetable-related"
(13, 28), "frozen treats/drink" (22), "presentation/display-related" (23), "headwear-related" (25), "livestock-related" (26), and

original model feature. c-d, t-SNE visualization of 1,854 objects, showing emergent category clusters in the learned embedding

6/39more. In general, categories such as animals, food, and technology are universally recognized across humans, LLMs, and
MLLMs, indicating a common conceptual basis. Humans excel at distinguishing object differences through perceptual features
like color, shape, and texture, which are less pronounced in LLM and MLLM. Moreover, LLM and MLLM tend to form more
speciﬁc categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables, headwear) than humans’ broader categorizations. The absence of certain dimensions
in human representations does not imply an inability to perceive them; rather, these dimensions may emerge at a higher level,
such as humans consolidating "vegetable-related" and "nut-related" dimensions under a "food-related" dimension.
The dimensions derived from LLM and MLLM appear to exhibit a degree of interpretability, as evidenced by the ability
to assign intuitive labels to them. These labels were listed in Extended Data Table 1. We also annotated these dimensions
using MLLM, comparing human-generated vs. MLLM-generated labels in Extended Data Table 2. In addition, we divided all
dimensions into visual, semantic, and mixed visual-semantic groups (based on examination by human experts) and calculated
the proportion for each group (Fig. 4e). LLM and MLLM have more semantic dimensions, while humans are better at using
visual information. In contrast, the purely vision model SimCLR (a self-supervised learning model) shows minimal ability to
learn semantic dimensions (Extended Data Fig. 7), whereas the dimensions derived from random representations lack any
interpretability (Supplementary Fig. 1). We also categorized dimensions by ease of interpretation (based on whether they can be
clearly explained by a single label), ﬁnding that most dimensions are easy to interpret (Fig. 4f). Speciﬁcally, 60/66 dimensions
for LLM, 57/66 for MLLM, and 62/66 for humans are easy to interpret, with humans having the fewest hard-to-interpret
dimensions.
We examined the composition of dimensions for speciﬁc objects. Fig. 4g uses circular bar plots to represent objects,
where petal angle and color denote dimensions, and length indicates the dimension’s importance. For example, "almond" is
primarily food-related, while "satellite" is associated with electronics and ﬂying. These plots also demonstrate that objects are
indeed characterized by a rather small number of dimensions, indicating that not all 66 dimensions are necessary for particular
similarity judgment. To quantify this, we progressively eliminated less signiﬁcant dimensions for each object and assessed
model performance. We found that retaining 3 to 8 dimensions for LLM, 2 to 10 for MLLM, and 7 to 13 for humans sufﬁces to
achieve 95-99% of the full model’s performance in explaining behavioral judgments within the odd-one-out context (Fig. 4h).
LLM exhibits lower dimensionality than humans, likely due to its lack of visual input. Although MLLM can access visual data,
its multimodal integration remains inferior to human capabilities, limiting dimensions related to shape or color, inherently tied
to human visual experience.
Comparison between models and humans
We employed two approaches to assess model-human alignment: one measuring consistency in similarity judgments58 and
the other analyzing core dimension relationships.
Using comprehensive triplet sampling on 48 objects, we estimated similarity via choice probabilities and correlated model
and human similarity matrices with Pearson correlation. Fig. 5a compares various models, including visual-only, visual-
language, LLMs, MLLMs, and a Gabor baseline, revealing higher human-consistency for LLM and MLLM. A preliminary
comparison between ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in Fig. 5b, directly based on their choice consistency with human on 2,171
triplets, shows that notable differences remain between LLMs and human. To delve deeper into the reasons behind these
differences, we show in Fig. 5c the most relevant dimensions that humans and models rely on to make choices (see Methods).
We see that human and models make different choices because of the differently key dimensions they rely on. For example,
human can make choice based on color (like "red"), while LLM only makes choice based on semantics (like "protective").
More examples are in Extended Data Fig. 1f.
Next, we explored the relationship between the core dimensions of LLMs and humans, as shown in Fig. 5d. The matrices
are generally sparse, indicating that a dimension in one system strongly correlates with only a few dimensions in the other.
Many dimensions even show a strong one-to-one mapping. Quantitatively, 31 out of the 66 LLM dimensions and 42 out of
the 66 MLLM dimensions strongly correlate with human dimensions (r > 0.4), indicating substantial alignment. In MLLM,
several human dimensions are subdivided (e.g., human dim. 18 "ﬂuid-related" splitting into MLLM dims. 18 "container" and
22 "ﬂuid-related") or amalgamated (e.g., human dims. 3 "animal-related" and 40 "disgusting" merging into MLLM dim. 34
"insect-related"). Similarly, LLM shows adaptations, particularly in semantics, though it lacks sensory dimensions like color or
shape. For example, LLM distinguishes between dim. 22 "frozen treats" and dim. 57 "hot drinks" (or dim. 2 "wild animals" vs.
dim. 26 "livestock," dim. 13 "vegetables" vs. dim. 18 "fruits," etc.). While MLLM still lacks speciﬁc color-related dimensions
(e.g., "red," "black"), it aligns more closely with humans, especially in dimensions like shape (e.g., dim. 35 "grainy," dim. 64
"round/curvature") and spatial features (e.g., dim. 8 "serried/stacked," dim. 44 "dense/many small things"). This shows that
MLLM, like humans, can perceive a large amount of visual information. Quantitatively, Fig. 5e shows the number of shared
and unique dimensions (r > 0.2) between models and humans, where 38 of 66 dimensions being shared across the three systems.

10/39To link LLMs’ embeddings with brain responses, we applied searchlight RSA53 (see Fig. 6a) using fMRI data from the NSD
dataset52 . Independent dimension rating models were ﬁtted for each dimension, and these models predicted multi-dimensional
embeddings for objects, creating a representational geometry. We then compared this predicted RSM to SPoSE embedding
RSMs of brain ROIs and searchlight RSMs of brain sectors to gauge how well the LLM’s embedding aligns with brain regions.
The representational similarity scores for each model and brain ROI are depicted in Fig. 6b. It should be noted that we
adopted the SPoSE method to infer low-dimensional embeddings for CLIP59 (here used as a strong baseline60 ) and brain ROIs,
using cosine distance as a metric to construct the desired odd-one-out records. Human and MLLM embeddings outperform
LLM and CLIP, particularly in functionally deﬁned, category-selective ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC, FFA). However, ROI-based
analysis may miss ﬁne-grained spatial patterns, as similar scores can conceal spatial differences.
Figs. 6c&d display ﬁne-grained cortical maps of human, LLM, and MLLM embeddings using searchlight RSA and
voxel-wise encoding (see Methods) for subject S1, highlighting only signiﬁcant voxels (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected). Additional
models and subjects are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8a. Visual inspection shows MLLM and human embeddings align more
closely with most of the brain regions than LLM and CLIP, and the contrast of local details can also be clearly viewed. This
performance difference is most obvious under searchlight RSA, and relatively moderate in voxel-wise encoding. Beyond
overall performance metric, peaks in the cortical maps align with scene-selective61 (PPA, RSC, OPA), body-selective62 (EBA)
and face-selective63, 64 (FFA, OFA) ROIs, suggesting MLLM captures semantic relationships similar to human cognition.
Furthermore, both the overall performance levels and the pattern consistency remain stable across multiple subjects (Extended
Data Fig. 8a). Voxel-wise encoding results based on the original CLIP embedding and its low-dimensional SPoSE embedding
(Extended Data Fig. 8b) also provide strong evidence that SPoSE is an effective intrinsic dimension learning method. Fig. 6e
presents 2-D histograms of human, LLM and MLLM performance in R2 against noise ceiling across all voxels. For human and
MLLM, most voxels in the category-selective ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC, FFA) are predicted close to their 85% noise ceiling,
while LLM is slightly worse. Fig. 6f presents 2D histograms comparing LLM and MLLM to human performance across whole
brain voxels. LLM and MLLM achieve about 60% and 85% of human performance under searchlight RSA, respectively. In
voxel-wise encoding, LLM reaches 90% of human performance, while MLLM nearly matches human levels.
Discussion
The present study comprehensively investigates object concept representations in LLMs and MLLMs, and their relationship
to human cognition and brain representations. We collected 4.7 million behavioral judgments to derive 66 stable dimensions
predicting object similarity, uncovering semantic clustering in both LLM and MLLM embeddings, resembling human mental
structures. Despite differing architectures, these models developed conceptual representations similar to humans, supported
by interpretable dimensions reﬂecting core aspects of object understanding. MLLM, which integrates visual and linguistic
data, predicted individual choices at 85.9% of the noise ceiling, consistent with ﬁndings that multimodal learning enhances
representation robustness and generalizability65–67 . Moreover, the strong alignment between MLLM embeddings and neural
activity in regions like EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA suggests that MLLM representations share similarities with human conceptual
knowledge68 .
Broad applications of the derived embeddings
The low-dimensional mental embeddings identiﬁed in this study can be used in human-machine representation alignment
and fusion, potentially enhancing human-machine interfaces and collaborative systems by revealing shared object representation
schemas. Practically, these interpretable dimensions could inform the development of more human-like artiﬁcial cognitive
systems, improving their natural interaction with humans69 . To better align LLM and MLLM with human reasoning in the
odd-one-out task, we can explore the method of guiding model attention to human-preferred dimensions. By tailoring prompts
to emphasize speciﬁc attributes (e.g., "red" or "artiﬁcial"), we believe that models could make choices more consistent with
human judgments (i.e., explicit guidance can help bridge the gap between model and human reasoning; Supplementary Figs.
2-4). Moreover, the collected extensive machine behavioral datasets offer a valuable benchmark for evaluating AI model
representations.
Relationship to the other related studies
Both the human brain and large-scale AI models are complex systems, typically analyzed through dimensionality reduction.
Recent hypotheses like the "low-rank"70 and "distributed information bottleneck"71 propose solutions to identifying optimal
latent dimensions. Our ﬁndings align with these concepts, demonstrating that LLMs can develop human-like object represen-
tations using fundamental dimensions, akin to the brain’s capacity to derive rich conceptual knowledge from simple neural
mechanisms. Exploring these low-dimensional structures could deepen our understanding of cognition in both biological and
artiﬁcial systems.
11/39The similarity between LLMs and human representations, despite differing input modalities, suggests a convergence
beyond data covariance. This is consistent with ﬁndings on innate semantic transformations in the visual system72 , and is
further supported by the interpretability of LLMs’ embeddings, reﬂecting fundamental semantic structures. Prior studies73–75
demonstrate that artiﬁcial models can predict visual brain activity, which aligns with our results showing model-neural
correlations in higher cortical regions. These ﬁndings suggest LLMs develop representations that capture key aspects of human
conceptual knowledge76, 77 , further highlighting the natural alignment between language and vision78, 79 . Previous fMRI studies
have revealed diverse organizational principles in the brain for processing external stimuli. The primary visual cortex exhibits
retinotopy through eccentricity and angle selectivity80, 81 . These principles of dimensional organization extend to higher-order
information82–88 . Our study expands this research to the conceptual representations of natural objects.
Traditionally, neural network representations are analyzed by examining neuron activation patterns89–92 . However, as
AI systems grow in complexity, neuron-level approaches become less effective. Instead, inspired by cognitive psychology,
behavioral methods can infer AI system representations through actions. Decades of research have developed techniques to
elucidate mental representations from human behavior16, 93 . Our study adopts this behavioral approach for LLMs, comple-
menting existing neuron-level methods. Probing LLMs from a cognitive perspective has gained attention35, 94–98 , revealing
insights into areas like color processing99 , emotion analysis100, 101 , memory102, 103 , morality104 , and decision-making40, 105, 106 .
Understanding the parallels between human cognition and LLMs offers exciting opportunities to explore the intersections of AI
and cognitive science37, 69 .
Limitations and future directions
One potential limitation of this study is its focus on ChatGPT-3.5 and Gemini Pro Vision (v1.0), which may not encompass
the full spectrum of models. However, the methodology is extendable to other state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4V107 . This
extension could reveal the generalization of identiﬁed dimensions and highlight the unique aspects of different AI architectures.
Another potential limitation is that the impact of varying language prompts on LLMs’ responses. In this study, the language
prompts we used were carefully designed to ensure that the LLMs understand the task instructions correctly. We think
that these considerations have a negligible impact on the study’s overall conclusions. Moreover, we only employed object-
level annotations in the language prompts of LLM. Object-level annotations focus on abstract categories, while image-level
annotations (generated by a vision-language model or human annotators) can capture more image-speciﬁc visual attributes like
color and texture (Supplementary Fig. 5). Using the image-level annotations will make LLM more consistent with human
judgments (this can be conﬁrmed in the MLLM probing experiments, which is equivalent to using image-level annotation in
essence), highlighting the importance of visual information in similarity judgments (Supplementary Figs. 6-8).
Future work could leverage instruction ﬁne-tuning for LLM/MLLM on large-scale triplet odd-one-out question-answer
pairs, where answers include both human choices and the underlying reasoning dimensions, to improve model-human alignment.
Methods
Stimuli and triplet odd-one-out task. In selecting stimulus objects, our preference was for the THINGS database50 , a resource
designed to encompass 1,854 living and non-living objects based on their practical usage in daily life. During the triplet
odd-one-out task, participants (humans or LLMs) encountered three objects drawn from the THINGS database, either through
images or textual descriptions. Their objective was to identify the object with the highest dissimilarity among the three. This
task evaluates the relationship between two objects considering the context set by a third object. Featuring a diverse range of
objects, this method provides a systematic means to assess perceived similarity unaffected by context, thus minimizing response
bias. Moreover, it enables the measurement of context-dependent similarity, such as by restricting similarity evaluations to
speciﬁc higher-level categories like animals or vehicles.
Behavioral responses from humans. The human behavioral dataset utilized in our research originated from a recent study17 ,
where 5,517,400 human similarity judgments were collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. After quality control–which
excluded 818,240 trials (14.83%) based on overly fast responses (>25% trials <800ms and >50% <1,100ms), repetitive patterns
(outside central 95% distribution in ≥200 trials), and inconsistent demographic reporting (>3 ages provided)–the ﬁnal dataset
comprised 4,699,160 valid trials from 12,340 participants. Participants (6,619 female; 4,400 male; 56 other/unspeciﬁed; mean
age = 36.71 years, SD = 11.87; 41.9% unreported age) were right-handed with normal/corrected vision, compensated at $0.10
per 20 trials. The protocol, approved by the NIH Institutional Review Board (93-M-0170) and NIH Ofﬁce of Human Research
Subject Protection, obtained informed consent. While self-selection bias (tech-savvy English-speakers) and handedness exclu-
sion may limit generalizability, the focus on relative similarity judgments–demonstrated robust across demographics16 –reduces
population-speciﬁc effects.
12/39Collecting behavioral responses from LLM. For our study, we gathered all human-used similarity judgments, totaling 4.7
million trials. To solicit responses from ChatGPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo), Llama3.1 (Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), and GPT-4
(gpt-4-0314), we employed a prompt where each image was represented by its object name and descriptions, as image input
processing was not supported by these models. These text descriptions are sourced from deﬁnitions of object names in WordNet,
Google, or Wikipedia, and have been compiled and made publicly available at https://osf.io/jum2f/. For model
comparison, Llama3.1 was used to collect the full sampling of triplets (91,568 trials) of the 48 typical objects. Due to cost
constraints, GPT-4 only amassed a total of 2,171 trials, primarily for initial comparisons with ChatGPT-3.5.
The prompt structure used was standardized: "Given a triplet of objects {[Object_A], [Object_B], [Object_C]}, which one
in the triplet is the odd-one-out? Please give the answer rst and then explain in detail." In practice, [Object_A], [Object_B],
and [Object_C] were replaced with the respective object descriptions for each trial. The temperature parameter, dictating
response randomness in LLMs, was set to 0.01. Because of the well-structured nature of the model’s responses, we parsed
the model choice from the ﬁrst sentence of their response using string matching. To assess the upper limit of predictability
under dataset randomness (the noise ceiling), we randomly selected 1,000 triplets and conducted a minimum of 14 trials and a
maximum of 25 trials for each using the same prompt, evaluating consistency in choices across trials.
Collecting behavioral responses from MLLM. Regarding collecting behavioral responses from Gemini Pro Vision (v1.0), we
adopted a similar strategy. The prompt we used is as follows: "You are shown three object images side by side and are asked to
report the image that was the least similar to the other two. You should focus your judgment on the object, but you are not given
additional constraints as to the strategy you should use. If you did not recognize the object, you should base your judgment on
your best guess of what the object could be. 1. Tell me your answer. 2. Tell me the location of the object you have chosen. 3.
Explain the reasons." In some trials, the Gemini Pro Vision model refused to respond because it believed that the given images
contained some unknown sensitive information. In this case, we applied a method akin to image replacement to address the
issue.
The temperature parameter for determining response randomness in Gemini Pro Vision was also conﬁgured to 0.01, with
images displayed at 512 x 512 pixels. Since the model’s responses are well structured, we extracted the keyword about the
position of the object in its answers (e.g., "left," "middle," or "right") to determine the model’s choice. Similarly, to gauge
the noise ceiling and potential predictability, we additionally sampled 1,000 randomly chosen triplets and ran a minimum of
14 trials and a maximum of 25 trials for each of them using the same prompt for each trial and estimated the consistency of
choices for each triplet across trials.
As for the model of Qwen2_VL-7B, we used a similar strategy to collect the full sampling of triplets for the 48 typical objects.
Constructing behavioral responses for the other models. For models do not have visual or language-based question-answer
capabilities (such as CLIP, SimCLR, VGG16, etc.), we ﬁrst used the pre-trained model to extract the features of the object
images (or their language descriptions), and then constructed the required odd-one-out data based on the cosine distance of the
features.
Feature extractors. For the pre-trained models originally used for classiﬁcation tasks (such as VGG16, ResNet18, etc.),
we extracted the penultimate layer features, rather than the head. For CLIP, we extract features in the ﬁnal embedding layer.
For GPT2 and Llama3.1, we extracted features by averaging the last hidden state activations across all tokens to obtain
sentence embeddings. For Qwen2_VL, we extracted image features from the last layer of its visual branch, which is based
on a 600M-parameter ViT. Some of the pretrained models sourced from the following repositories: the Torchvision model
zoo, the Pytorch-Image-Models (timm) library, the VISSL (self-supervised) model zoo, the OpenAI CLIP collection, and the
Transformer python library. In particular, the Gabor model feature extractor consists of a single ﬁxed set of convolutions: 12
Gabor wavelets with spatial frequency log-spaced between 3 and 72 cyc/stimulus at 6 evenly-spaced orientations between 0 and
π, following previous work108 .
Natural Scene Dataset (NSD). NSD52 , recognized as the largest neuroimaging dataset linking brain insights with artiﬁcial
intelligence, involves richly sampled fMRI data from 8 subjects. Across 30-40 MRI sessions, each subject observed between
9,000-10,000 distinct natural scenes using whole-brain gradient-echo EPI at 1.8 mm isotropic resolution and 1.6 s TR during
7T scanning. Image stimuli were drawn from the COCO dataset109 , with corresponding captions retrievable using COCO ID.
To assess the generalization ability of the low-dimensional embeddings learned from humans and LLMs across datasets, the
shared_1k subset from the NSD were chosen as the test set (because the stimuli in this subset were shared by all 8 subjects).
Additionally, fMRI responses linked to the shared_1k stimuli across subjects S1, S2, S5, and S7 were earmarked for subsequent
analysis (because subjects S3, S4, S6, and S8 did not complete the full fMRI data acquisition).
13/39Sparse Positive Similarity Embedding (SPoSE). Utilizing the SPoSE approach16, 39 , we derived embedding representations
for 1,854 objects based on similarity judgment data from LLM and MLLM, respectively. The PyTorch implementation for this
process can be accessed at https://github.com/ViCCo-Group/SPoSE. Initially, an embedding matrix X was created
with random weights in the range of 0 to 1 across 100 latent dimensions for each object, resulting in a 1854-by-100 matrix.
Stochastic gradient descent was subsequently applied to ﬁne-tune this embedding matrix using odd-one-out responses. The
optimization objective function aimed to minimize a combination of cross-entropy loss concerning triplet choice probabilities
for all options and an L1-norm on the weights to promote sparsity:


m
n
exp (xi x j )
+ λ ∑ ∥x∥1 ,
(1)
min L (x) = ∑ log
exp (xi x j ) + exp (xi xk ) + exp (x j xk )
where x corresponds to an object vector; i, j and k to the indices of the current triplet; n to the number of triplets; and m to the
number of objects. The regularization parameter λ , which controls the trade-off between sparsity and model performance, was
determined using cross-validation on the training set (λ = 0.004 for LLM, 0.0035 for MLLM, 0.00385 for humans, and 0.007
for the other models and brain ROIs). In addition to sparsity, the optimization was constrained by strictly enforcing weights in
the embedding X to be positive. The minimization of this objective was carried out using stochastic gradient descent with an
Adam optimizer110 (with default parameters) and a batch size of 100 on triplet odd-one-out judgments. After the optimization
was complete, dimensions with weights below 0.1 for all objects were eliminated. Finally, the dimensions underwent sorting
based on the sum of their weights across objects in descending order.
This model operates under two key theoretical assumptions. Firstly, it postulates sparsity within the embedding space
dimensions, indicating that each object primarily inﬂuences certain dimensions rather than all. Secondly, it assumes positivity
in these dimensions. Consequently, an object’s weight on a speciﬁc dimension signiﬁes the extent of the related property within
the object. These assumptions diverge from typical dimensionality reduction approaches like Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), which assume dense dimensions across the real number spectrum. Furthermore, SPoSE facilitates cross-correlations
among dimensions while PCA assumes independence. Consequently, SPoSE often uncovers a greater number of dimensions,
reﬂecting ﬁner details or attributes, which are more easily interpretable compared to PCA dimensions. Notably, the weight an
object holds on a dimension directly corresponds to the presence of the associated property within the object.
We opted for the behavioral odd-one-out task and the SPoSE method to learn the low-dimensional embeddings of LLMs
rather than attempting to directly access their internal features, primarily due to the challenges associated with extracting
features from modern, large-scale LLMs that are often proprietary or too vast to navigate directly. This approach allows us
to circumvent the limitations imposed by the closed nature or sheer scale of contemporary LLMs, providing us with a more
feasible avenue to explore their mental representations.
Reproducibility of embedding dimensions. Considering the stochastic nature of the optimization process, the SPoSE method
yields varying sets of dimensions upon each reiteration. To assess the stability of the 66-dimensional embedding, we conducted
20 model runs with distinct random initializations. Evaluating each original dimension against all dimensions in the 20 reference
embeddings, we identiﬁed the best-matching dimension based on the highest correlation. Consistent with previous research16 , a
Fisher z-transform was applied to these correlations, averaged across the 20 reference embeddings, and then reversed to obtain
a mean reliability value for each dimension across all 20 embeddings.
Category prediction. Evaluating the representational embeddings’ categorization performance involved testing them across 18
out of the 27 THINGS database categories. Objects falling into multiple categories were excluded from the analysis, resulting
in the removal of 9 categories. Among these excluded categories, 7 were subcategories or had less than ten unique objects
post-ﬁltering. The remaining 18 categories included clothing, toy, vehicle, container, electronic device, animal, furniture,
body part, food, musical instrument, plant, home decor, sports equipment, ofﬁce supply, part of car, medical equipment, tool,
and weapon, totaling 1,112 objects. Classiﬁcation was conducted through leave-one-object-out cross-validation. Training
involved computing category centroids by averaging the 66-dimensional vectors of all objects within each category, excluding
the left-out object. The category membership of the excluded object was predicted based on the smallest Euclidean distance to
the respective centroid. This process was iterated for all 1,112 objects, with prediction accuracy averaged across the dataset.
The chance level is determined by 1000 permutation tests.
Evaluating consistency between humans and models by comparing behaviors. With the exception of GPT-4, all other
models (and human) have completed behavioral data acquisition on the full sample triples of the 48 typical objects described
above. For each model, we constructed its RSM for the 48 objects by calculating the choice probability of each object pair. To
estimate human consistency, following previous work58 , we computed the Pearson correlation on the behavioral RSMs from the
model (m) and the human (h) and we then divide that raw Pearson correlation by the geometric mean of the split-half internal
14/39reliability measured for each system as follows:
hal f
ρ̃(m, h) = 
ρ(RSMm , RSMh )
hal f
hal f
hal f
hal f
ρ(RSMm 1 , RSMm 2 )ρ(RSMh 1 , RSMh 2 )
,
(2)
hal f
where RSMm 1 and RSMm 2 were computed by using the split-half behavioral data of triples of the 48 typical objects, and
hal f
hal f
similar for RSMh 1 and RSMh 2 .
Comparison between ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was conducted directly based on their choice consistency with human on a
speciﬁc set of 2,171 triplets. We conducted a total of 5 comparisons, each based on randomly selecting 1,000 samples from
these 2,171 samples, and ﬁnally reported the average result.
Dimensional relevance score for odd-one-out choice. For a given triplet, we compute the original predicted softmax probabil-
ities based on the entire low-dimensional embeddings of each image within the triplet. Then, we iteratively remove a certain
dimension from the low-dimensional embeddings, calculate the softmax probabilities predicted by the pruned embeddings, and
then compute the difference between the softmax probabilities obtained before and after pruning. This difference is taken as the
relevance score for that dimension. This approach has been used in a previous study26 .
Dimension naming. In deﬁning the human mental embedding, the dimension names from a previous investigation were
employed as references17 . However, for LLM and MLLM, each of the 66 dimensions within the embedding was associated
with common-sense labels through a straightforward naming procedure. Speciﬁcally, we analyze a set of 1-by-12 images
of objects and identify shared properties described in the images. Each array consisted of images selected from the top of
one dimension from the embedding. Ten of the authors provided concise labels, limited to 1–2 words, describing the arrayed
images. Subsequently, word clouds were generated to visualize dimension names, showcasing the distribution of labels based
on frequency, utilizing the wordcloud function in MATLAB (Mathworks) with default settings. Finally, the lead authors of this
study gave intuitive labels for each dimension. Dimension labels were also summed up by the MLLM (here gemini-pro-1.5-exp)
with the prompt as follows: "There are 9 subgures in the picture. Please use 1-2 English words or phrases to describe the
common theme represented by these 9 subgures."
Dimension rating for NSD images. We predicted the 66 object dimensions for each image within the NSD dataset. Speciﬁcally,
we leveraged the OpenAI-trained CLIP model59 (with "ViT-L/14" as the backbone), which is a multimodal model trained on
image-text pairs and which was recently demonstrated to yield excellent prediction of human similarity judgments111, 112 . For
each of the 1,854 object images in the THINGS dataset, we extracted the image and text features from the ﬁnal layer of the
CLIP image and text encoders, respectively. Subsequently, for each of the 66 dimensions of LLM (or MLLM, or Human),
we ﬁtted a ridge regression model to predict dimension values, using a concatenation of the extracted image and text features
from CLIP as input. The optimal regularization hyperparameters were determined by using 5-fold cross-validation across the
training set (100 candidate parameters spaced evenly on a log scale from 10−3 to 103 , that is np.logspace(-3, 3, 100)) . These
trained regression models were then applied to the extracted features across all images in the NSD dataset.
Searchlight RSA. For fMRI, local cerebral RSMs were computed in subject space within a grey-matter spherical region (6 mm
diameter) centered at each voxel location. RSA analyses assessed the Pearson correlation r between the local cerebral RSM and
each kind of the model RSMs.
SPoSE RSA. For each brain ROI, we extracted the fMRI signal in that region on the shared_1k dataset and constructed a large
number of odd-one-out data based on the cosine distance. After that, SPoSE learning was used to obtain the corresponding
low-dimensional embeddings of each brain ROI, and the RSMs of each ROI were calculated using the learned low-dimensional
embeddings. Finally, Pearson correlations between the brain ROI RSM and the model RSM were calculated.
Voxel-wise encoding. For each subject in the NSD, we built a ridge regression model to predict the fMRI response to each test
image per voxel. The images of the training set are subject-speciﬁc, but the images of the test set are shared (that is, shared_1k).
For all training and testing images, we ﬁrst used the dimension rating model to predict the low-dimensional embeddings, and
then conducted voxel-wise ﬁtting based on the predicted embeddings. The regularization parameter for each voxel was selected
autonomously through a 5-fold cross-validation process on the training dataset. We explored 100 evenly spaced regularization
parameters on a logarithmic scale ranging from 10−3 to 103 , which corresponds to the np.logspace(-3, 3, 100) function in
Python. The model’s accuracy was assessed on the test dataset utilizing both Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (r) and the noise
15/39ceiling normalized coefﬁcient of determination (R2 ). Following the NSD work52 , the noise ceiling was calculated by:
NC = 100 ×
ncsnr2
,
ncsnr2 + 1n
(3)
where n indicates the number of trials that are averaged together (n = 3 for subjects S1, S2, S5, and S7), and ncsnr indicates the
noise ceiling signal-to-noise ratio which has been provided in NSD. To ascertain the statistical signiﬁcance of our predictions,
we conducted a bootstrapping procedure, resampling the test dataset with replacement 2,000 times, and subsequently calculated
the False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted P-values.

Visualization of cerebral cortex. To visualize the analytical outcomes across the entire cortical region, we employed ﬂattened
cortical surfaces derived from individual subjects’ anatomical images. FreeSurfer113 facilitated the generation of cortical
surface meshes from T1-weighted anatomical images. This process involved applying ﬁve relaxation cuts on each hemisphere’s
surface and excluding the corpus callosum. Subsequently, functional images were registered to the anatomical images and
mapped onto the surfaces for visualization purposes using Pycortex114 .

related to Fig. 4). MLLM matches human annotation highly consistently marked with ✓✓, consistent with ✓, and inconsistent
with %. While MLLM excels at concrete comparative tasks (like triplet odd-one-out selection), it shows limitations in
dimension naming tasks that require abstracting and generalizing across diverse visual and semantic features.
