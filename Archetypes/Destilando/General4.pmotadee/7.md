### Properties

All options are stored as properties on the `Glob` object.

- `opts` The options provided to the constructor.
- `patterns` An array of parsed immutable `Pattern` objects.

## Options

Exported as `GlobOptions` TypeScript interface. A `GlobOptions`
object may be provided to any of the exported methods, and must
be provided to the `Glob` constructor.

All options are optional, boolean, and false by default, unless
otherwise noted.

All resolved options are added to the Glob object as properties.

If you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob
object as the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to
share the previously loaded cache.

- `cwd` String path or `file://` string or URL object. The
  current working directory in which to search. Defaults to
  `process.cwd()`. See also: "Windows, CWDs, Drive Letters, and
  UNC Paths", below.

  This option may be either a string path or a `file://` URL
  object or string.

- `root` A string path resolved against the `cwd` option, which
  is used as the starting point for absolute patterns that start
  with `/`, (but not drive letters or UNC paths on Windows).

  Note that this _doesn't_ necessarily limit the walk to the
  `root` directory, and doesn't affect the cwd starting point for
  non-absolute patterns. A pattern containing `..` will still be
  able to traverse out of the root directory, if it is not an
  actual root directory on the filesystem, and any non-absolute
  patterns will be matched in the `cwd`. For example, the
  pattern `/../*` with `{root:'/some/path'}` will return all
  files in `/some`, not all files in `/some/path`. The pattern
  `*` with `{root:'/some/path'}` will return all the entries in
  the cwd, not the entries in `/some/path`.

  To start absolute and non-absolute patterns in the same
  path, you can use `{root:''}`. However, be aware that on
  Windows systems, a pattern like `x:/*` or `//host/share/*` will
  _always_ start in the `x:/` or `//host/share` directory,
  regardless of the `root` setting.

- `windowsPathsNoEscape` Use `\\` as a path separator _only_, and
  _never_ as an escape character. If set, all `\\` characters are
  replaced with `/` in the pattern.

  Note that this makes it **impossible** to match against paths
  containing literal glob pattern characters, but allows matching
  with patterns constructed using `path.join()` and
  `path.resolve()` on Windows platforms, mimicking the (buggy!)
  behavior of Glob v7 and before on Windows. Please use with
  caution, and be mindful of [the caveat below about Windows
  paths](#windows). (For legacy reasons, this is also set if
  `allowWindowsEscape` is set to the exact value `false`.)

- `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar`
  matches. Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern
  will always match dot files.

- `magicalBraces` Treat brace expansion like `{a,b}` as a "magic"
  pattern. Has no effect if {@link nobrace} is set.

  Only has effect on the {@link hasMagic} function, no effect on
  glob pattern matching itself.

- `dotRelative` Prepend all relative path strings with `./` (or
  `.\` on Windows).

  Without this option, returned relative paths are "bare", so
  instead of returning `'./foo/bar'`, they are returned as
  `'foo/bar'`.

  Relative patterns starting with `'../'` are not prepended with
  `./`, even if this option is set.

- `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches. Note that this
  requires additional stat calls.

- `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.

- `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames. (Ie,
  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)

- `noext` Do not match "extglob" patterns such as `+(a|b)`.

- `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match. This defaults to
  `true` on macOS and Windows systems, and `false` on all others.

  **Note** `nocase` should only be explicitly set when it is
  known that the filesystem's case sensitivity differs from the
  platform default. If set `true` on case-sensitive file
  systems, or `false` on case-insensitive file systems, then the
  walk may return more or less results than expected.

- `maxDepth` Specify a number to limit the depth of the directory
  traversal to this many levels below the `cwd`.

- `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does
  not contain any slash characters. That is, `*.js` would be
  treated as equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in
  all directories.

- `nodir` Do not match directories, only files. (Note: to match
  _only_ directories, put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)

  Note: when `follow` and `nodir` are both set, then symbolic
  links to directories are also omitted.

- `stat` Call `lstat()` on all entries, whether required or not
  to determine whether it's a valid match. When used with
  `withFileTypes`, this means that matches will include data such
  as modified time, permissions, and so on. Note that this will
  incur a performance cost due to the added system calls.

- `ignore` string or string[], or an object with `ignored` and
  `childrenIgnored` methods.

  If a string or string[] is provided, then this is treated as a
  glob pattern or array of glob patterns to exclude from matches.
  To ignore all children within a directory, as well as the entry
  itself, append `'/**'` to the ignore pattern.

  **Note** `ignore` patterns are _always_ in `dot:true` mode,
  regardless of any other settings.

  If an object is provided that has `ignored(path)` and/or
  `childrenIgnored(path)` methods, then these methods will be
  called to determine whether any Path is a match or if its
  children should be traversed, respectively.

- `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**`
  patterns. This can result in a lot of duplicate references in
  the presence of cyclic links, and make performance quite bad.

  By default, a `**` in a pattern will follow 1 symbolic link if
  it is not the first item in the pattern, or none if it is the
  first item in the pattern, following the same behavior as Bash.

  Note: when `follow` and `nodir` are both set, then symbolic
  links to directories are also omitted.

- `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the
  results. In the case of an entry that cannot be resolved, the
  entry is omitted. This incurs a slight performance penalty, of
  course, because of the added system calls.

- `absolute` Set to true to always receive absolute paths for
  matched files. Set to `false` to always receive relative paths
  for matched files.

  By default, when this option is not set, absolute paths are
  returned for patterns that are absolute, and otherwise paths
  are returned that are relative to the `cwd` setting.

  This does _not_ make an extra system call to get the realpath,
  it only does string path resolution.

  `absolute` may not be used along with `withFileTypes`.

- `posix` Set to true to use `/` as the path separator in
  returned results. On posix systems, this has no effect. On
  Windows systems, this will return `/` delimited path results,
  and absolute paths will be returned in their full resolved UNC
  path form, eg insted of `'C:\\foo\\bar'`, it will return
  `//?/C:/foo/bar`.

- `platform` Defaults to value of `process.platform` if
  available, or `'linux'` if not. Setting `platform:'win32'` on
  non-Windows systems may cause strange behavior.

- `withFileTypes` Return [PathScurry](http://npm.im/path-scurry)
  `Path` objects instead of strings. These are similar to a
  NodeJS `Dirent` object, but with additional methods and
  properties.

  `withFileTypes` may not be used along with `absolute`.

- `signal` An AbortSignal which will cancel the Glob walk when
  triggered.

- `fs` An override object to pass in custom filesystem methods.
  See [PathScurry docs](http://npm.im/path-scurry) for what can
  be overridden.

- `scurry` A [PathScurry](http://npm.im/path-scurry) object used
  to traverse the file system. If the `nocase` option is set
  explicitly, then any provided `scurry` object must match this
  setting.

- `includeChildMatches` boolean, default `true`. Do not match any
  children of any matches. For example, the pattern `**\/foo`
  would match `a/foo`, but not `a/foo/b/foo` in this mode.

  This is especially useful for cases like "find all
  `node_modules` folders, but not the ones in `node_modules`".

  In order to support this, the `Ignore` implementation must
  support an `add(pattern: string)` method. If using the default
  `Ignore` class, then this is fine, but if this is set to
  `false`, and a custom `Ignore` is provided that does not have
  an `add()` method, then it will throw an error.

  **Caveat** It _only_ ignores matches that would be a descendant
  of a previous match, and only if that descendant is matched
  _after_ the ancestor is encountered. Since the file system walk
  happens in indeterminate order, it's possible that a match will
  already be added before its ancestor, if multiple or braced
  patterns are used.

  For example:

  ```js
  const results = await glob(
    [
      // likely to match first, since it's just a stat
      'a/b/c/d/e/f',

      // this pattern is more complicated! It must to various readdir()
      // calls and test the results against a regular expression, and that
      // is certainly going to take a little bit longer.
      //
      // So, later on, it encounters a match at 'a/b/c/d/e', but it's too
      // late to ignore a/b/c/d/e/f, because it's already been emitted.
      'a/[bdf]/?/[a-z]/*',
    ],
    { includeChildMatches: false },
  )
  ```

  It's best to only set this to `false` if you can be reasonably
  sure that no components of the pattern will potentially match
  one another's file system descendants, or if the occasional
  included child entry will not cause problems.

## Glob Primer

Much more information about glob pattern expansion can be found
by running `man bash` and searching for `Pattern Matching`.

"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls
*.js` on the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore`
file.

Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are
expanded into a set. Braced sections start with `{` and end with
`}`, with 2 or more comma-delimited sections within. Braced
sections may contain slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would
expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.

The following characters have special magic meaning when used in
a path portion. With the exception of `**`, none of these match
path separators (ie, `/` on all platforms, and `\` on Windows).

- `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion.
  When alone in a path portion, it must match at least 1
  character. If `dot:true` is not specified, then `*` will not
  match against a `.` character at the start of a path portion.
- `?` Matches 1 character. If `dot:true` is not specified, then
  `?` will not match against a `.` character at the start of a
  path portion.
- `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp
  range. If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then
  it matches any character not in the range. If the first
  character is `]`, then it will be considered the same as `\]`,
  rather than the end of the character class.
- `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not
  match any of the patterns provided. May _not_ contain `/`
  characters. Similar to `*`, if alone in a path portion, then
  the path portion must have at least one character.
- `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of
  the patterns provided. May _not_ contain `/` characters.
- `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of
  the patterns provided. May _not_ contain `/` characters.
- `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns
  provided. May _not_ contain `/` characters.
- `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns
  provided. May _not_ contain `/` characters.
- `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it
  matches zero or more directories and subdirectories searching
  for matches. It does not crawl symlinked directories, unless
  `{follow:true}` is passed in the options object. A pattern
  like `a/b/**` will only match `a/b` if it is a directory.
  Follows 1 symbolic link if not the first item in the pattern,
  or 0 if it is the first item, unless `follow:true` is set, in
  which case it follows all symbolic links.

`[:class:]` patterns are supported by this implementation, but
`[=c=]` and `[.symbol.]` style class patterns are not.

### Dots

If a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first
character, then it will not match any glob pattern unless that
pattern's corresponding path part also has a `.` as its first
character.

For example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at
`a/.b/c`. However the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does
not start with a dot character.

You can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting
`dot:true` in the options.

### Basename Matching

If you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has
no slashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the
tree with a matching basename. For example, `*.js` would match
`test/simple/basic.js`.

### Empty Sets

If no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.
This differs from the shell, where the pattern itself is
returned. For example:

```sh
$ echo a*s*d*f
a*s*d*f
```

## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations

While strict compliance with the existing standards is a
worthwhile goal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and
other implementations, and are intentional.

The double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless
the `noglobstar` flag is set. This is supported in the manner of
bsdglob and bash 5, where `**` only has special significance if
it is the only thing in a path part. That is, `a/**/b` will match
`a/x/y/b`, but `a/**b` will not.

Note that symlinked directories are not traversed as part of a
`**`, though their contents may match against subsequent portions
of the pattern. This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and
the like. You can force glob to traverse symlinks with `**` by
setting `{follow:true}` in the options.

There is no equivalent of the `nonull` option. A pattern that
does not find any matches simply resolves to nothing. (An empty
array, immediately ended stream, etc.)

If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before
any other interpretation of the glob pattern. Thus, a pattern
like `+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is
expanded **first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and
those patterns are checked for validity. Since those two are
valid, matching proceeds.

The character class patterns `[:class:]` (posix standard named
classes) style class patterns are supported and unicode-aware,
but `[=c=]` (locale-specific character collation weight), and
`[.symbol.]` (collating symbol), are not.

### Repeated Slashes

Unlike Bash and zsh, repeated `/` are always coalesced into a
single path separator.

### Comments and Negation

Previously, this module let you mark a pattern as a "comment" if
it started with a `#` character, or a "negated" pattern if it
started with a `!` character.

These options were deprecated in version 5, and removed in
version 6.

To specify things that should not match, use the `ignore` option.

## Windows

**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**

Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only
`/` characters are used by this glob implementation. You must use
forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions. Back-slashes will
always be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Results from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto
the root setting using `path.join`. On windows, this will by
default result in `/foo/*` matching `C:\foo\bar.txt`.

To automatically coerce all `\` characters to `/` in pattern
strings, **thus making it impossible to escape literal glob
characters**, you may set the `windowsPathsNoEscape` option to
`true`.

### Windows, CWDs, Drive Letters, and UNC Paths

On posix systems, when a pattern starts with `/`, any `cwd`
option is ignored, and the traversal starts at `/`, plus any
non-magic path portions specified in the pattern.

On Windows systems, the behavior is similar, but the concept of
an "absolute path" is somewhat more involved.

#### UNC Paths

A UNC path may be used as the start of a pattern on Windows
platforms. For example, a pattern like: `//?/x:/*` will return
all file entries in the root of the `x:` drive. A pattern like
`//ComputerName/Share/*` will return all files in the associated
share.

UNC path roots are always compared case insensitively.

#### Drive Letters

A pattern starting with a drive letter, like `c:/*`, will search
in that drive, regardless of any `cwd` option provided.

If the pattern starts with `/`, and is not a UNC path, and there
is an explicit `cwd` option set with a drive letter, then the
drive letter in the `cwd` is used as the root of the directory
traversal.

For example, `glob('/tmp', { cwd: 'c:/any/thing' })` will return
`['c:/tmp']` as the result.

If an explicit `cwd` option is not provided, and the pattern
starts with `/`, then the traversal will run on the root of the
drive provided as the `cwd` option. (That is, it is the result of
`path.resolve('/')`.)

## Race Conditions

Glob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race
conditions, since it relies on directory walking.

As a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob
looks for it may have been deleted or modified by the time it
returns the result.

By design, this implementation caches all readdir calls that it
makes, in order to cut down on system overhead. However, this
also makes it even more susceptible to races, especially if the
cache object is reused between glob calls.

Users are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of
filesystem state in the face of rapid changes. For the vast
majority of operations, this is never a problem.

## Comparison to Other JavaScript Glob Implementations

**tl;dr**

- If you want glob matching that is as faithful as possible to
  Bash pattern expansion semantics, and as fast as possible
  within that constraint, _use this module_.
- If you are reasonably sure that the patterns you will encounter
  are relatively simple, and want the absolutely fastest glob
  matcher out there, _use [fast-glob](http://npm.im/fast-glob)_.
- If you are reasonably sure that the patterns you will encounter
  are relatively simple, and want the convenience of
  automatically respecting `.gitignore` files, _use
  [globby](http://npm.im/globby)_.

There are some other glob matcher libraries on npm, but these
three are (in my opinion, as of 2023) the best.

---

**full explanation**

Every library reflects a set of opinions and priorities in the
trade-offs it makes. Other than this library, I can personally
recommend both [globby](http://npm.im/globby) and
[fast-glob](http://npm.im/fast-glob), though they differ in their
benefits and drawbacks.

Both have very nice APIs and are reasonably fast.

`fast-glob` is, as far as I am aware, the fastest glob
implementation in JavaScript today. However, there are many
cases where the choices that `fast-glob` makes in pursuit of
speed mean that its results differ from the results returned by
Bash and other sh-like shells, which may be surprising.

In my testing, `fast-glob` is around 10-20% faster than this
module when walking over 200k files nested 4 directories
deep[1](#fn-webscale). However, there are some inconsistencies
with Bash matching behavior that this module does not suffer
from:

- `**` only matches files, not directories
- `..` path portions are not handled unless they appear at the
  start of the pattern
- `./!(<pattern>)` will not match any files that _start_ with
  `<pattern>`, even if they do not match `<pattern>`. For
  example, `!(9).txt` will not match `9999.txt`.
- Some brace patterns in the middle of a pattern will result in
  failing to find certain matches.
- Extglob patterns are allowed to contain `/` characters.

Globby exhibits all of the same pattern semantics as fast-glob,
(as it is a wrapper around fast-glob) and is slightly slower than
node-glob (by about 10-20% in the benchmark test set, or in other
words, anywhere from 20-50% slower than fast-glob). However, it
adds some API conveniences that may be worth the costs.

- Support for `.gitignore` and other ignore files.
- Support for negated globs (ie, patterns starting with `!`
  rather than using a separate `ignore` option).

The priority of this module is "correctness" in the sense of
performing a glob pattern expansion as faithfully as possible to
the behavior of Bash and other sh-like shells, with as much speed
as possible.

Note that prior versions of `node-glob` are _not_ on this list.
Former versions of this module are far too slow for any cases
where performance matters at all, and were designed with APIs
that are extremely dated by current JavaScript standards.

<small id="fn-webscale">[1]: In the cases where this module
returns results and `fast-glob` doesn't, it's even faster, of
course.</small>

### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

https-proxy-agent

### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### TypeScript example

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const info = {
    host: 'br41.nordvpn.com',
    userId: 'your-name@gmail.com',
    password: 'abcdef12345124'
};
const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);

https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => {
    console.log(res.headers);
    res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `http` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
    console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
    res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
    console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
    res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
    console.log('"open" event!');
    socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
    console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
    socket.close();
});
```

## Installing

### Package manager

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add axios
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add axios
```

Using bun:

```bash
$ bun add axios
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using `import` or `require` approach:

```js
import axios, {isCancel, AxiosError} from 'axios';
```

You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the Axios factory:

```js
import axios from 'axios';

console.log(axios.isCancel('something'));
````

If you use `require` for importing, **only default export is available**:

```js
const axios = require('axios');

console.log(axios.isCancel('something'));
```

For some bundlers and some ES6 linters you may need to do the following:

```js
import { default as axios } from 'axios';
```

For cases where something went wrong when trying to import a module into a custom or legacy environment,
you can try importing the module package directly:

```js
const axios = require('axios/dist/browser/axios.cjs'); // browser commonJS bundle (ES2017)
// const axios = require('axios/dist/node/axios.cjs'); // node commonJS bundle (ES2017)
```

### CDN

Using jsDelivr CDN (ES5 UMD browser module):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.6.7/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios@1.6.7/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```

## Example

> **Note**: CommonJS usage  
> In order to gain the TypeScript typings (for intellisense / autocomplete) while using CommonJS imports with `require()`, use the following approach:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
//const axios = require('axios'); // legacy way

// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get('/user?ID=12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios.get('/user', {
    params: {
      ID: 12345
    }
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/user?ID=12345');
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

> **Note**: `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
> Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
axios.post('/user', {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get('/user/12345');
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get('/user/12345/permissions');
}

Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()])
  .then(function (results) {
    const acct = results[0];
    const perm = results[1];
  });
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: '/user/12345',
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  }
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image in node.js
axios({
  method: 'get',
  url: 'https://bit.ly/2mTM3nY',
  responseType: 'stream'
})
  .then(function (response) {
    response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('ada_lovelace.jpg'))
  });
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios('/user/12345');
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods.

##### axios.request(config)
##### axios.get(url[, config])
##### axios.delete(url[, config])
##### axios.head(url[, config])
##### axios.options(url[, config])
##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE
When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don't need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency (Deprecated)
Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions.

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'}
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)
##### axios#get(url[, config])
##### axios#delete(url[, config])
##### axios#head(url[, config])
##### axios#options(url[, config])
##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: '/user',

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: 'get', // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute and option `allowAbsoluteUrls` is set to true.
  // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
  // to methods of that instance.
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',

  // `allowAbsoluteUrls` determines whether or not absolute URLs will override a configured `baseUrl`.
  // When set to true (default), absolute values for `url` will override `baseUrl`.
  // When set to false, absolute values for `url` will always be prepended by `baseUrl`.
  allowAbsoluteUrls: true,

  // `transformRequest` allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server
  // This is only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', 'PATCH' and 'DELETE'
  // The last function in the array must return a string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer,
  // FormData or Stream
  // You may modify the headers object.
  transformRequest: [function (data, headers) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `transformResponse` allows changes to the response data to be made before
  // it is passed to then/catch
  transformResponse: [function (data) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'},

  // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request
  // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object
  params: {
    ID: 12345
  },
  
  // `paramsSerializer` is an optional config that allows you to customize serializing `params`. 
  paramsSerializer: {

    // Custom encoder function which sends key/value pairs in an iterative fashion.
    encode?: (param: string): string => { /* Do custom operations here and return transformed string */ }, 
    
    // Custom serializer function for the entire parameter. Allows user to mimic pre 1.x behaviour.
    serialize?: (params: Record<string, any>, options?: ParamsSerializerOptions ), 
    
    // Configuration for formatting array indexes in the params. 
    indexes: false // Three available options: (1) indexes: null (leads to no brackets), (2) (default) indexes: false (leads to empty brackets), (3) indexes: true (leads to brackets with indexes).    
  },

  // `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE , and 'PATCH'
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer, FormData (form-data package)
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred'
  },

  // syntax alternative to send data into the body
  // method post
  // only the value is sent, not the key
  data: 'Country=Brasil&City=Belo Horizonte',

  // `timeout` specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out.
  // If the request takes longer than `timeout`, the request will be aborted.
  timeout: 1000, // default is `0` (no timeout)

  // `withCredentials` indicates whether or not cross-site Access-Control requests
  // should be made using credentials
  withCredentials: false, // default

  // `adapter` allows custom handling of requests which makes testing easier.
  // Return a promise and supply a valid response (see lib/adapters/README.md)
  adapter: function (config) {
    /* ... */
  },
  // Also, you can set the name of the built-in adapter, or provide an array with their names
  // to choose the first available in the environment
  adapter: 'xhr', // 'fetch' | 'http' | ['xhr', 'http', 'fetch']

  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used, and supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  // Please note that only HTTP Basic auth is configurable through this parameter.
  // For Bearer tokens and such, use `Authorization` custom headers instead.
  auth: {
    username: 'janedoe',
    password: 's00pers3cret'
  },

  // `responseType` indicates the type of data that the server will respond with
  // options are: 'arraybuffer', 'document', 'json', 'text', 'stream'
  //   browser only: 'blob'
  responseType: 'json', // default

## Response Schema

The response for a request contains the following information.

```js
{
  // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
  data: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `statusText` is the HTTP status message from the server response
  statusText: 'OK',

  // `headers` the HTTP headers that the server responded with
  // All header names are lowercase and can be accessed using the bracket notation.
  // Example: `response.headers['content-type']`
  headers: {},

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  // It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects)
  // and an XMLHttpRequest instance in the browser
  request: {}
}
```

When using `then`, you will receive the response as follows:

```js
axios.get('/user/12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response.data);
    console.log(response.status);
    console.log(response.statusText);
    console.log(response.headers);
    console.log(response.config);
  });
```

When using `catch`, or passing a [rejection callback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) as second parameter of `then`, the response will be available through the `error` object as explained in the [Handling Errors](#handling-errors) section.

## Config Defaults

You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.

### Global axios defaults

```js
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://api.example.com';

// Important: If axios is used with multiple domains, the AUTH_TOKEN will be sent to all of them.
// See below for an example using Custom instance defaults instead.
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = AUTH_TOKEN;

axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded';
```

### Custom instance defaults

```js
// Set config defaults when creating the instance
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'
});

// Alter defaults after instance has been created
instance.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = AUTH_TOKEN;
```

### Config order of precedence

Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in [lib/defaults/index.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/main/lib/defaults/index.js#L49), then `defaults` property of the instance, and finally `config` argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.

```js
// Create an instance using the config defaults provided by the library
// At this point the timeout config value is `0` as is the default for the library
const instance = axios.create();

// Override timeout default for the library
// Now all requests using this instance will wait 2.5 seconds before timing out
instance.defaults.timeout = 2500;

// Override timeout for this request as it's known to take a long time
instance.get('/longRequest', {
  timeout: 5000
});
```

## Interceptors

You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by `then` or `catch`.

```js

const instance = axios.create();

// Add a request interceptor
instance.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
    // Do something before request is sent
    return config;
  }, function (error) {
    // Do something with request error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });

// Add a response interceptor
instance.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {
    // Any status code that lie within the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger
    // Do something with response data
    return response;
  }, function (error) {
    // Any status codes that falls outside the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger
    // Do something with response error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });
```

If you need to remove an interceptor later you can.

```js
const instance = axios.create();
const myInterceptor = instance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
```

You can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.
```js
const instance = axios.create();
instance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
instance.interceptors.request.clear(); // Removes interceptors from requests
instance.interceptors.response.use(function () {/*...*/});
instance.interceptors.response.clear(); // Removes interceptors from responses
```

You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.

```js
const instance = axios.create();
instance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
```

When you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay
in the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for
the interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag
to the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.

```js
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
  config.headers.test = 'I am only a header!';
  return config;
}, null, { synchronous: true });
```

If you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,
you can add a `runWhen` function to the options object. The request interceptor will not be executed **if and only if** the return
of `runWhen` is `false`. The function will be called with the config
object (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an
asynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.

```js
function onGetCall(config) {
  return config.method === 'get';
}
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
  config.headers.test = 'special get headers';
  return config;
}, null, { runWhen: onGetCall });
```

> **Note:** options parameter(having `synchronous` and `runWhen` properties) is only supported for request interceptors at the moment.

### Multiple Interceptors

Given you add multiple response interceptors
and when the response was fulfilled
- then each interceptor is executed
- then they are executed in the order they were added
- then only the last interceptor's result is returned
- then every interceptor receives the result of its predecessor
- and when the fulfillment-interceptor throws
    - then the following fulfillment-interceptor is not called
    - then the following rejection-interceptor is called
    - once caught, another following fulfill-interceptor is called again (just like in a promise chain).

Read [the interceptor tests](./test/specs/interceptors.spec.js) for seeing all this in code.

## Error Types

There are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.

The general structure of axios errors is as follows:
| Property  | Definition  |
| -------- | ----------  |
| message  | A quick summary of the error message and the status it failed with. |
| name     | This defines where the error originated from. For axios, it will always be an 'AxiosError'. |
| stack    | Provides the stack trace of the error. | 
| config   | An axios config object with specific instance configurations defined by the user from when the request was made |
| code     | Represents an axios identified error. The table below lists out specific definitions for internal axios error.  |
| status   | HTTP response status code. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for common HTTP response status code meanings. 

Below is a list of potential axios identified error:
| Code  |  Definition   |
| -------- | ----------  |
| ERR_BAD_OPTION_VALUE | Invalid or unsupported value provided in axios configuration. |
| ERR_BAD_OPTION | Invalid option provided in axios configuration. |
| ECONNABORTED | Request timed out due to exceeding timeout specified in axios configuration. |
| ETIMEDOUT | Request timed out due to exceeding default axios timelimit. |
| ERR_NETWORK | Network-related issue.
| ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS | Request is redirected too many times; exceeds max redirects specified in axios configuration.
| ERR_DEPRECATED | Deprecated feature or method used in axios. 
| ERR_BAD_RESPONSE | Response cannot be parsed properly or is in an unexpected format. 
| ERR_BAD_REQUEST | Requested has unexpected format or missing required parameters. |
| ERR_CANCELED | Feature or method is canceled explicitly by the user.   
| ERR_NOT_SUPPORT | Feature or method not supported in the current axios environment. 
| ERR_INVALID_URL | Invalid URL provided for axios request.

## Handling Errors

the default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.

```js
axios.get('/user/12345')
  .catch(function (error) {
    if (error.response) {
      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
      // that falls out of the range of 2xx
      console.log(error.response.data);
      console.log(error.response.status);
      console.log(error.response.headers);
    } else if (error.request) {
      // The request was made but no response was received
      // `error.request` is an instance of XMLHttpRequest in the browser and an instance of
      // http.ClientRequest in node.js
      console.log(error.request);
    } else {
