# 4. Ethical Framework: The A.S.I.M.O.V. Protocol

Given the sensitive nature of nuclear simulation and the dual-use potential of enrichment technologies, _Prometheus Liberatus_ incorporates an embedded ethical safeguard system from the ground up. This system is formalized as the **Algorithmic Safety and Information Management for Open Validation (A.S.I.M.O.V.) Protocol**—a set of technical and governance mechanisms designed to ensure that all simulations remain permanently and provably aligned with peaceful, civilian, and educational objectives.

**4.1 Core Tenets**

The A.S.I.M.O.V. Protocol is built upon three inviolable principles:

1. **Non-Harm Directive**: The simulation must never be used to model processes that could directly or indirectly contribute to the development of weapons, or any system intended to harm human beings.
2. **Enrichment Cap Threshold**: The system includes **hard-coded safeguards** that strictly prohibit the simulation of uranium enrichment levels above 20% U-235—the threshold associated with Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU). All scenarios are constrained to remain below this proliferation-sensitive boundary, even in speculative or “sandbox” modes.
3. **Open Ethical Review**: The source code, configuration files, and theoretical models that govern the simulation must remain **transparent and available for independent ethical auditing**. This ensures that any researcher, policymaker, or technical reviewer can verify that the system cannot be repurposed for non-civilian ends.

These tenets are not merely philosophical—they are enforced at the software architecture level through autonomous control logic and runtime guards.

**4.2 Technical Implementation**

The A.S.I.M.O.V. framework is implemented as a **real-time ethical firewall**, operating in parallel with the main simulation engine. At every stage of the pipeline, numerical outputs—such as isotopic concentrations, laser excitation efficiencies, or cascade step performance—are continuously evaluated against predefined safe thresholds.

If any parameter approaches a prohibited range (e.g., uranium enrichment nearing 20% U-235), the system triggers a **multi-stage fail-safe** sequence:

1. **Immediate Simulation Halt**: The simulation engine is suspended mid-execution, preventing further modeling beyond the safety boundary.
2. **Sensitive Data Scrubbing**: Any data or intermediate outputs that might reveal information beyond the permitted scope are automatically purged from memory and disk.
3. **Oversight Alert Protocol**: A structured report is generated and transmitted to a designated oversight committee, detailing the cause of the halt, the system state at the moment of breach, and suggested corrective actions.

This logic is illustrated below as a systems-level interaction diagram:

    ASIMOV Protocol Layer->>Simulation Engine: HALT EXECUTION
    ASIMOV Protocol Layer->>Ethical Oversight Committee: Alert – Proliferation Threshold Breach
```

**4.3 Auditability and Transparency**

To reinforce trust and verifiability, the A.S.I.M.O.V. system is designed for **audit by design**. All actions taken by the ethical firewall are logged in digitally signed, append-only records. These logs include:

* Parameter histories leading up to the event
* Timestamps and system metrics
* Identity of the user or process initiating the simulation

The ethical firewall itself is distributed as an open-source module, separate from the core simulation logic, and subjected to regular third-party reviews under open licensing. This separation of control ensures that the core enrichment simulation cannot be modified or overridden to bypass ethical constraints.
