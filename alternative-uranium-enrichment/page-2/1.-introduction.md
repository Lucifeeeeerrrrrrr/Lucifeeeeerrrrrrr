# 1. Introduction

The dual-use character of nuclear technology—its ability to serve both civilian and military ends—has made it one of the most consequential and tightly controlled scientific domains in the modern world. While nuclear processes can unlock immense benefits in energy production, medical diagnostics, and research, they also carry risks that range from environmental harm to geopolitical instability. Central to this tension is the process of uranium enrichment: the act of increasing the concentration of uranium-235 (U-235) to a level suitable for sustained nuclear reactions.

Conventional enrichment methods, such as gas ultracentrifugation, are widely used and technically mature. However, they are also resource-intensive, requiring substantial energy inputs, complex infrastructure, and stringent regulatory oversight. In addition, these technologies—by their very nature—introduce proliferation risks, as the same methods used for civilian-grade fuel can, if extended, produce weapons-grade material.

Project _Prometheus Liberatus_ was created as a computational response to this challenge. It is a simulation-based framework—a "digital twin" of a hypothetical next-generation enrichment system—designed for research, education, and ethical exploration. Rather than operating in the physical realm, the project constructs a virtual environment where the entire enrichment pipeline is modeled with high fidelity, allowing users to study the thermodynamics, kinetics, and control logic of nuclear processes without ever interacting with actual radioactive materials.

This abstraction into the algorithmic space offers several advantages. It removes the physical hazards and regulatory barriers of real-world experimentation, enabling innovation in process design, AI-based control, and multi-scale modeling. It also allows for the implementation of embedded ethical constraints, ensuring that all simulations remain within peaceful and legally compliant boundaries.

The system architecture integrates four distinct phases into a continuous enrichment process:&#x20;

1. **Selective Bio-Mining**, using engineered microorganisms to extract uranium from low-grade ores;&#x20;
2. **Non-Thermal Plasma Conversion**, replacing hazardous chemical conversions with controlled plasma reactions;&#x20;
3. **CRISLA Laser Enrichment**, employing selective laser activation to isolate U-235; and (4) **Predictive AI Control**, where graph-based neural networks optimize flow and efficiency in real-time.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and potential applications of this simulation framework. It demonstrates how high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, and molecular-scale modeling can be combined to create a new class of digital nuclear research tools—tools that are safe, open, and aligned with both scientific curiosity and international nonproliferation norms.
