# 2. The Unified Technological Framework

_Prometheus Liberatus_ models a four-phase enrichment system designed as a closed-loop, near-zero-waste process. Each stage operates as a distinct subsystem within a larger simulated infrastructure, governed by an overarching artificial intelligence that acts as the plant’s digital nervous system. The entire pipeline is implemented through high-performance computing (HPC) techniques, allowing for physically plausible behavior at molecular and macroscopic scales. The following sections describe each phase in detail, including its conceptual model, governing equations, and HPC implementation.

#### 2.1 Phase 1: Selective Bio-Mining

This phase replaces conventional mechanical uranium extraction with a biologically guided alternative. Instead of crushing rock and using harsh chemicals, we simulate the deployment of genetically engineered microorganisms—_**Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans**_—to selectively leach uranium oxide (**U₃O₈**) from low-grade ore or even residual tailings.

**Concept**

This system can be thought of as programming a microscopic workforce. Each bacterium operates as a self-directed agent, navigating through ore matrices and initiating chemical reactions that liberate uranium molecules. This approach is inherently selective, biologically safe, and far less environmentally invasive than traditional mining. In simulation, the modeled colony achieves up to **95% uranium recovery efficiency**, while significantly reducing simulated waste and energy inputs.

**Mathematical Model**

The leaching process is modeled as a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations, incorporating microbial kinetics and swarm intelligence. The extraction rate is governed by:

Where:

* Cu is the concentration of uranium in the ore,
* X is the microbial biomass density,
* k and K\_s are kinetic constants, and
* αswarm\alpha\_{\text{swarm\}} is a dynamic scaling term derived from swarm intelligence algorithms modeling collective bacterial behavior.

**HPC Implementation**

Colony behavior and diffusion-reaction processes are simulated using CUDA kernels, enabling massively parallel evaluation of bacterial interactions across the ore geometry. This allows real-time feedback on resource depletion, biofilm growth, and leaching fronts over large spatial domains.

#### 2.2 Phase 2: Cold Conversion via Non-Thermal Plasma

Following bio-leaching, the recovered uranium oxide (U₃O₈, or "yellowcake") is converted into uranium hexafluoride (**UF₆**)—a gaseous form required for enrichment. Traditionally, this step involves hydrofluoric acid (HF), a highly toxic and corrosive chemical. In _Prometheus Liberatus_, we replace this with a **non-thermal plasma process** conducted in a simulated microwave reactor.

**Concept**

This phase operates as a kind of “cold chemistry,” where high-energy electrons drive reactions without heating the bulk material. The simulated reactor is modeled as a 2.45 GHz microwave chamber lined with a **Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂)** catalyst. The plasma initiates two key reactions:

This cold conversion process reduces simulated energy consumption for this step by over **90%**, while eliminating HF from the materials lifecycle.

**Mathematical Model**

The process is modeled using a reaction-diffusion framework combined with energy transfer equations, where the reaction rates depend on plasma density and microwave power:

Where keffk\_{\text{eff\}} is an effective plasma-enhanced rate constant that captures electron-impact energy transfer as a function of microwave power PP and local temperature TT.

**HPC Implementation**

Molecular dynamics simulations are implemented in C++ with **OpenMP and MPI**, enabling particle-scale modeling of plasma-gas interactions. The simulations resolve millions of collisions and recombination events per time step, capturing the stochastic and localized nature of non-thermal plasma chemistry.

#### 2.3 Phase 3: Advanced Laser Enrichment (CRISLA)

This phase constitutes the core of the enrichment process. It substitutes the brute mechanical separation of isotopes—typically done with thousands of centrifuges—with **isotope-selective photonic activation**, using precisely tuned laser light.

**Concept**

The **CRISLA** method—_Chemical Reaction by Isotope Selective Laser Activation_—relies on laser excitation of **U-235** hexafluoride molecules without affecting **U-238**. A narrow-band **Erbium-doped fiber laser**, emitting at exactly **16 micrometers**, selectively excites vibrational modes in **U-235F₆**. These activated molecules then undergo a secondary chemical reaction, allowing them to be isolated from the unexcited U-238F₆.

This phase offers unparalleled selectivity and energy efficiency. In simulation, the isotopic separation precision reaches **0.01 eV**, sufficient to isolate U-235 molecules with near-perfect accuracy.

**Mathematical Model**

Isotopic separation is quantified using the separation factor α\alpha, which is a function of the excitation probabilities:

Where Pexcite(i)P\_{\text{excite\}}(i) represents the probability that isotope ii is excited at a given laser frequency and intensity.

**HPC Implementation**

This is the most computationally demanding phase. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** are used to model the cascade of chemical and physical interactions, while **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)** methods simulate the quantum behavior of the excited molecules. Simulations are GPU-accelerated using PyTorch and CUDA, enabling near-real-time feedback on separation efficiency, laser targeting, and beam–molecule interactions across the enrichment chamber.

***

#### 2.4 Phase 4: Predictive AI Control

The final phase provides dynamic, system-wide optimization via artificial intelligence. Rather than operating as a fixed controller, the AI is designed as a **real-time digital twin** of the entire plant, constantly updating its internal state and issuing control signals to maintain optimal operation.

**Concept**

The AI acts as a predictive monitoring layer, anticipating system deviations and correcting them before they impact performance. Using data from embedded sensors (simulated or real), the AI adjusts flow rates, reaction conditions, and laser parameters to minimize inefficiencies and mitigate risks. It is trained to operate with **three-sigma failure tolerance**, meaning it can detect anomalies long before human operators would.

**Mathematical Model**

The AI uses a multi-layer **Graph Neural Network**, where each node represents a subsystem (e.g., reactor chamber, gas flow line), and edges model their interactions. The system state vector for node vv at layer l+1l+1 is updated as:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This structure allows the AI to learn how perturbations in one part of the system affect the others.

**HPC Implementation**

The AI model is trained using **PyTorch**, and deployed across distributed **GPU clusters** for real-time inference. It is trained and benchmarked using open datasets from the **IAEA Nuclear Data Services**, ensuring that its predictions remain grounded in validated physical models. During simulation, inference is performed every control cycle (\~milliseconds), enabling the system to maintain equilibrium under varying operational conditions.
