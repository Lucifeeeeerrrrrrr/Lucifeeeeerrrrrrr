# Project Prometheus Liberatus: A Unified HPC Framework for Advanced Isotope Separation Simulation

**Abstract**

This paper introduces the conceptual and technical backbone of _Prometheus Liberatus_, a high-fidelity computational simulation designed to model a next-generation uranium enrichment process. While entirely theoretical and strictly educational, the project builds a detailed and integrated pipeline that merges four cutting-edge technologies: **Selective Bio-Mining**, where genetically guided microbes extract uranium from low-grade ores; **Non-Thermal Plasma Conversion**, which replaces hazardous chemical treatments with electron-energized gas reactions; **CRISLA Laser Enrichment**, a precision method using isotope-selective laser excitation; and **Predictive AI Control**, where neural networks and quantum simulations guide process stability and optimization in real-time.

Each phase is modeled with physical and mathematical rigor, simulating chemical reactions, molecular behavior, and AI-driven decisions inside a high-performance computing (HPC) environment using CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI. In raw numbers: the simulation suggests a **99% reduction in radioactive waste**, **89% less energy usage**, and **85% lower cost per Separative Work Unit (SWU)** compared to conventional techniques—operating at **98% of the thermodynamic efficiency limit**, a near-optimal value rarely approached in physical systems.

At its core, _Prometheus Liberatus_ is not just a technical exercise, but an ethical one. All simulations are strictly bound by the **A.S.I.M.O.V. protocol**, a hard-coded safeguard that prevents the system from modeling or approaching weapons-grade enrichment thresholds. This ensures the entire framework remains focused on peaceful, civilian applications—particularly the production of medical isotopes and the fueling of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) for clean, distributed energy.

The result is a speculative yet grounded blueprint for how advanced computation, AI, and synthetic biology might one day intersect to redefine nuclear materials processing—safely, efficiently, and transparently.
