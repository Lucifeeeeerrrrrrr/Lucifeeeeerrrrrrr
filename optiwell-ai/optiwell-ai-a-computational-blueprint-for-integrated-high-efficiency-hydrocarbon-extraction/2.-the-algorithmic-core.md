# 2. The Algorithmic Core

#### **The Algorithmic Core: A Multi-Agent Framework for Cross-Domain Optimization**

At the heart of **OptiWell-AI** lies a transformative shift in how artificial intelligence is applied in upstream oil and gas operations. Rather than relying on disconnected, task-specific AI models, the platform introduces a **cooperative ecosystem of intelligent agents**—each specializing in a core domain, yet continuously learning from and adapting to the actions of the others.

These agents operate on a **shared data infrastructure**, exchanging information in real-time through tightly integrated feedback loops. The output of one agent feeds directly into the decision-making process of the next. This structure enables **cross-domain optimization**, allowing the system to view the entire extraction lifecycle not as isolated stages, but as a **cohesive, living system**.

To make this concept tangible, imagine a high-performance pit crew composed of a **radiologist**, a **race car driver**, and a **military strategist**—each performing their roles with surgical precision and sharing critical insights in real-time.

#### **2.1 Agent 1: The Geo-Cognitive Agent**

The team’s “radiologist,” designed to diagnose the Earth. This agent radically accelerates the interpretation of seismic data by identifying faults, stratigraphic features, and reservoir structures within complex 3D volumes—tasks that traditionally take geoscientists weeks or months.

A **3D U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**—a deep learning architecture proven in medical imaging for its ability to segment detailed structures within volumetric datasets. Seismic data, like MRI scans, requires understanding complex forms hidden inside noisy 3D environments.

* **Input**: Raw or pre-processed 3D seismic volumes (e.g., in SEG-Y format).
* **Output**: High-resolution fault probability maps and stratigraphic horizons, structured in **RESQML**, ready for integration with reservoir simulation tools.

Traditional seismic processing techniques, such as **Reverse Time Migration (RTM)**, solve complex partial differential equations (PDEs) to simulate wave behavior. These are computationally expensive and scale poorly. By contrast, inference with a trained U-Net model involves a fixed set of matrix multiplications and convolution operations—achieving **performance boosts of 100–200x** compared to RTM, with near-constant execution time.

#### **2.2 Agent 2: The Real-Time Drilling Agent (RT-Drill)**

The system’s “race car driver,” this agent continuously adjusts drilling controls to optimize **Rate of Penetration (ROP)** while minimizing vibration, torque anomalies, and premature drill bit wear—all in real time.

**Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**—a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for environments with continuous action spaces. DDPG learns optimal strategies through trial and error, using past experiences to improve future decisions.

**Reinforcement Learning Framework**:

* **State Vector**: Real-time drilling parameters including **Weight on Bit (WOB)**, **RPM**, torque, downhole vibration readings, mud properties, and geological insights from the Geo-Cognitive Agent.
* **Action Vector**: Continuous control variables for WOB and RPM.
* **Reward Function**: A composite metric that incentivizes high ROP while penalizing excessive vibration, bit wear, and deviation from drilling targets.

The system seeks to **maximize the cumulative discounted reward** over time, learning a policy that balances speed, safety, and operational efficiency.

In complex drilling scenarios, human operators can struggle to adapt to rapidly changing subsurface conditions. RT-Drill continuously learns from real-time data and outperforms traditional rule-based systems, leading to measurable gains in drilling efficiency and significant reductions in **Non-Productive Time (NPT)**.

#### **2.3 Agent 3: The Strategic Development Agent (SDA)**

The “grand strategist” of the system, the SDA looks far beyond real-time operations to manage the long-term development of the field. It forecasts production, plans well placements, and coordinates logistics such as supply vessel routing.

**Core Algorithms**:

**A. Production Forecasting**\
A hybrid **LSTM-GNN** (Long Short-Term Memory + Graph Neural Network) model is used:

* **LSTM** captures time-dependent behaviors of individual wells—tracking flow rates, pressures, and historical trends.
* **GNN** models the **spatial relationships** between wells, such as pressure interference and shared infrastructure constraints.

This allows the SDA to simulate how one well affects others over time, generating robust multivariate production forecasts.

**B. Well Placement & Logistics Optimization**\
These are **NP-hard problems** involving thousands of possible configurations. The SDA leverages:

* Forecasts from the LSTM-GNN
* A **Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)** metaheuristic to solve the **Maritime Inventory Routing Optimization (MIRO)** problem—efficiently scheduling support vessels, optimizing routing, and reducing idle time and fuel costs.

**Why It Works**:

* LSTM-GNNs consistently outperform traditional methods like **Decline Curve Analysis (DCA)**, especially in complex, non-linear production environments.
* The LNS approach, guided by real-time forecast data, finds near-optimal logistics solutions **orders of magnitude faster** than brute-force optimization or exact solvers.

***

#### **In Summary**

These three agents—each operating as an AI specialist in its domain—interact through shared data structures, feedback loops, and synchronized timelines. Together, they create a **resilient, continuously learning system** capable of optimizing upstream operations from the seismic survey to the supply chain.
